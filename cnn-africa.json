But when they come to land, their thick black coat absorbs the heat, and they desperately look for cover - both for themselves and their fragile eggs.   ", "Historically, the penguins dug burrows in layers of guano - accumulated seabird and bat feces - that lined Africa's penguin colonies, but in the 19th century, traders started selling guano as fertilizer, leaving the penguins and their eggs increasingly exposed to predators and the scorching sun.  ", "This, combined with other threats such as egg poaching, overfishing and climate change, has caused African penguin populations to plummet. In 2019, there were thought to be less than 20,000 breeding pairs, down from an estimated 1.5 to 3 million birds in 1900. For more than a decade, the species has been listed as endangered by the IUCN.

", "While guano trade petered out by the late 1800s, replicating the layers that accumulated over thousands of years isn't an option. Seabird populations have declined so much over time, there are simply not enough birds to recreate it, says Kevin Graham, associate curator of birds and ectotherms at Dallas Zoo and coordinator of the African Penguin Nest Project. Some estimate it would take around 600 years to produce one usable guano layer, he adds.  ", "Instead, the project decided to build artificial nests. At first glance, they look fairly simple - a domed structure made from two molded shells of fabric coated in ceramic slurry, with a small entrance measuring about 20 centimeters wide. But the design took years to develop, as Graham and other scientists closely studied old guano nests and worked out how best to \"emulate Mother Nature.\"   ", "Getting the right temperature and humidity inside the nest was the hardest and most important part, says Graham.

Any higher than that, there's a very real risk of the (unborn chicks in the) eggs dying,\" he explains.

Her stationary oxygen machine required mains power, making periods of loadshedding extremely stressful, particularly when power did not return as scheduled, her family said.

I can't eat, it's a waste. I can't cope like that,\" Motsamai told CNN.

", "Gys Olivier, a farmer from Hertzogville in Free State province, in east-central South Africa, says he and other farmers in the area have been forced to throw away hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of seed potatoes due to disruptions to the 'cold chain' - (the process of keeping produce refrigerated throughout the supply chain.)   ", "There is also less demand from growers due to water shortages, with pump stations reliant on electricity to operate.  ", "\"We have done everything we can to make sure there is food on the table for a very good price, but it's become so capital-intensive to farm,\" Olivier says.   ", "Meanwhile livestock and poultry are dying before they even get to the slaughterhouse.

The financial damage to the farmer was around ZAR1.6m ($93,300) according to local media reports.", "South Africa is notorious for high crime rates, and loadshedding is making it worse as home security systems fail when the power goes out, giving criminals a field day inside unsecured properties. Policing also becomes harder, with officers unable to reach crime scenes fast enough due to congestion when traffic lights are off.   ", "Tumelo Mogodiseng, General Secretary of the South African Policing Union (SAPU), describes the load-shedding as \"a pandemic.\"   ", "He says his members' lives are now more at risk, with officers unable to see potentially dangerous situations in the darkness, and police stations, many of which don't have backup power systems, at risk of attack from criminals during blackouts.  ", "\"Police are dying every day in this country. If this is happening in the daylight, what happens when there is no light for them to see at night?\"  ", "Mogodiseng also worries that crimes are going unreported, with citizens fearful of leaving their houses during outages and traveling in the darkness. \"Communities won't travel to police stations to open cases because they are afraid,\" he told CNN.  ", "Gareth Newham, who runs the Justice and Violence Prevention Programme at the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) in Pretoria, says that it's hard to get solid data on the impact outages are having on crime. While anecdotal evidence suggests criminals are exploiting outages, the recent escalation of loadshedding has coincided with the Christmas holidays, when crime rates typically spike.   ", "His biggest concern is that continued loadshedding or a temporary grid collapse could lead to a repeat of the coordinated civil unrest, rioting, and looting in parts of South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces 18 months ago.  ", "\"A complete breakdown in the grid could be the trigger for local level gangs getting more power, and we could see a similar kind of violence to that we saw in July 2021.\"  ", "Under the ruling African National Congress (ANC), in charge since 1994, Eskom has become synonymous with corruption, crime, and mismanagement.

", "A 2019 report by the South African Institution of Civil Engineering shows skilled engineers have been leaving the country in droves.  ", "Despite spending billions of USD on two huge coal power stations, neither works properly.  ", "Older plants are dilapidated due to a lack of maintenance, and organized crime steals vital coal supplies and cable from the rail lines going from mines to power stations.  ", "Renewable energy companies say they are desperate to supply to the grid, but the government has been slow to cut red tape and streamline regulatory processes that would reduce the time frame for environmental authorisations, registration of new projects and grid connection approvals.  ", "Legal challenges against the government and Eskom are stacking up. Several political parties and trade unions say they will take the government and state utility to court for not upholding their duty to provide electricity.  ", "With no end in sight to the outages, South Africans are desperate for alternative energy sources, but even they are out of the reach of many citizens.

It's a place where people go to \"chill out,\" but not to observe and connect with the wild and unique ecosystem, says Kenyan filmmaker, photographer and conservationist Jahawi Bertolli.  ", "Bertolli is determined to change this outlook and believes that visual storytelling is one way to do it. \"No one was telling stories about the ocean here (in Kenya),\" he says.   ", "So far, his work has focused mainly on the Lamu Archipelago along Kenya's northern coast, where his wife Elke Bertolli, also a photographer and filmmaker, grew up. Lamu is a hidden gem, he says, and filming has led to new discoveries. \"There's not much scientific work that's happened up here so a lot of what we're finding is new,\" he adds. \"We're finding these incredible reefs. We're finding incredible biodiversity.\"   ", "But this rich biodiversity is increasingly under threat. Bertolli says that harmful fishing practices, such as drag netting, coupled with habitat degradation due, in part, to coastal development, pollution and an increasing human population have caused a reduction in fish populations.   ", "Related: Stunning images from African Wildlife Foundation's photography award are inspiring conservation", "Not only is this bad for the ecosystem, but for local fishers too. Lamu is home to one of the oldest Swahili settlements in East Africa, a community who have depended on the ocean since the 12th century. Traditionally these fishers respected the balance with nature, says Bertolli. They stopped fishing when they had enough for what was needed, they only fished in certain seasons, and they left the coral reef alone, understanding it to be a home for fish, where they needed space and time to reproduce and grow. \"There's a lot of cultural knowledge, which is actually conservation knowledge. It's just packaged differently,\" Bertolli explains.   ", "In 2020, Bertolli made a short film about Lamu's sea life and the conservation traditions of the local fishers. He called it \"Bahari Yetu\" - \"Our Ocean\" in Swahili - and began showing it the local community. The screenings were a gamechanger, he says: \"When you bring back that imagery, all of a sudden people are like, 'Oh my God. Wow, this is ours ... this is our heritage, these are our reefs, this is what's happening underwater in our ocean.'\"  ", "A viewing of \"Bahari Yetu\" was also put on for local beach management units and members from the county government and fisheries department. Bertolli also screened another film he had made a few years earlier on locally managed marine areas in Africa. The next time the group met, all members voted unanimously to begin setting up a marine protected area around Lamu's Kinyika island, a craggy rock that acts as a nursing ground for seafaring birds and hosts a bustling coral reef system.   ", "For Bertolli and the people of the Lamu Archipelago, this has been a significant first step to ensuring the preservation of an essential ecosystem. While it's only the beginning and a management plan still needs to be established, Bertolli believes it has also been a testament to the power of visual storytelling. \"Because it was their film, told in their language, filmed here - it became an incredibly powerful tool to inspire the community to come together to try and start actually conserving these areas,\" he says.
