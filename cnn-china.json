Public anger had grown following the emergence of video footage that appeared to show lockdown measures delaying firefighters from accessing the scene and reaching victims.

Others lit their phone flashlights in remembrance of the lives lost in the enforcement of that zero-Covid policy - the lights reflecting on the river flowing below, according to images and reporting by CNN at the time.

They felt that what they had done was innocuous and no different from others in the crowd that night, according to people familiar with the thinking of some of those detained.   ", "But just over two weeks later, the round-up of these Beijing friends began. Starting from December 18, four women in the group of friends and one of their boyfriends were detained by police over a period of several days. The editor learned of detentions among her friends with a sense of terror, a source said. She decided that if she were going to be taken away too, it would be better from her hometown in central China than a rented flat in Beijing.

Why can we be taken away so arbitrarily?\" she asked.   ", "But on December 23, after returning to her hometown, she too was taken into custody, according to two people familiar with her situation.

Chinese authorities have a long and well-documented history of targeting feminists, and at least one of the women detained was questioned during her initial interrogation in November about whether she had any involvement in feminist groups or social activism, especially during time spent overseas, a source said.    ", "All felt the detentions indicated an ever-tightening space for free expression in China.   ", "\"To be honest, I think the logic of arresting them is quite unclear,\" said another source who knows them. \"Because they are really not particularly experienced (with activism) ... judging from this result, I can only say that this is a very ruthless suppression of some of the simplest and most spontaneous calls for justice in society today,\" the person said.  ", "\"If they were arrested and imprisoned because they went to participate in this peaceful protest, I feel that maybe any young person who loves literature and yearns for a little bit of so-called 'free thought' could be arrested,\" said an additional person. \"This signal is terrifying.\"   ", "As popular frustration from three years of zero-Covid lockdowns, mass testing and tracking boiled over into demonstrations of a type not seen since the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement of 1989, security forces largely refrained from an immediate overt, public crackdown that could have risked condemnation at home and abroad.   ", "Instead, in the days that followed, security forces were dispatched to the streets en masse to discourage further demonstrations, with police patrolling streets and checking cell phones, while also tracking down participants, warning them not to participate further or bringing some in for questioning, according to CNN reporting at the time.   ", "Even by December 7, as the government, amid mounting economic pressure, relaxed the Covid-19 policies that had sparked those protests, signs had already begun emerging of how much the Party viewed those who had gathered on the streets as a threat.  ", "In what appeared to be the first official acknowledgment of the protests on November 29, China's domestic security chief, without directly mentioning the demonstrations, called on law enforcement to \"resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces,\" state-run news agency Xinhua reported.   ", "Not long after, in more pointed comments, China's envoy in France suggested to reporters - without providing any evidence - that while the demonstrations may have begun due to public frustration with Covid-19 controls, they were swiftly co-opted by anti-China foreign forces, according to a transcript later posted on the embassy's website.   ", "In his New Year's Eve address in late December, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said, it was \"only natural for different people to have different concerns or hold different views on the same issue\" in a big country, and what mattered was \"building consensus\" - a comment seen by some observers as striking a conciliatory tone, in contrast to its security crackdown.    ", "\"The 'A4 revolution' really, really shocked the Chinese authorities,\" said academic lawyer Teng Biao, a globally recognized expert on defending human rights in China, using a popular name for the nationwide protests that alludes to the blank pieces of paper held by protesters. \"And the Chinese government really, really wanted to know who was behind the protest.\"   ", "\"It's possible that the Chinese government or the secret police ... have some theory that some protesters played an important role,\" said Teng, who is currently a visiting professor at the University of Chicago and has himself been detained in China for his human rights and legal work. \"They really want to get evidence of which protesters or participants have connections with the United States, with other countries, maybe foreign foundations, and they have used torture (in the past) to get confessions.\"   ", "International human rights groups have repeatedly accused China of extorting confessions from detainees through torture - a practice that is prohibited in China and which officials in the past said had been eliminated.   ", "The University of Chicago's Center for East Asian Studies on Wednesday also issued a statement saying they were \"aware that people, including a former student of the University of Chicago, have recently been detained in China due to their participation in peaceful protests,\" and called for their prompt release.  ", "Under Chinese criminal law, prosecutors have 37 days to approve a criminal detention or let the detainees go, and if people are not released within that time, they have little chance to be released before trial - and almost all trials end in a guilty verdict, according to Teng.   ", "One charge, \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\" that two of the friends have had formally approved against them, according to people familiar with the cases, carries a maximum sentence of up to five years. A release on bail, meanwhile, though rare, often leads to the dismissal of the case, Teng said.   ", "The handling of political and human rights cases in China, however, \"in practice ... is totally arbitrary,\" he said, adding that while these cases in Beijing had been brought to light there could be dozens, if not several hundred, similar such detentions in cities across the country that remain unreported - with families afraid to hire lawyers or talk to media.   ", "The deep uncertainty of what would come next within China's opaque system was clearly present in the mind of the editor as she recorded her video message in the days before her arrest. Then, she thought of her family, who would be unsure where she had gone - and what they would do in the situation they now find themselves.
