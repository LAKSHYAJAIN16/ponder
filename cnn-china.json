", "The squabble has sparked a headache for Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) boss - and former NBA star - Yao Ming and is the latest public spat to engulf a major league.  ", "The Xinjiang Guanghui Flying Tigers on Tuesday announced its withdrawal from the CBA after the league slapped it with a one-year suspension from acquiring and registering new players.   ", "Guanghui, which is based in China's western Xinjiang region, was slated to join other teams on Wednesday for the first matches after a mid-season break.  ", "But in a tersely-worded a statement this week the team accused the league of being \"full of chaos\" and publicly rebuked Yao's leadership.   ", "At the heart of the fallout between Guanghui and the league is China national team star Zhou Qi, who is himself now publicly feuding with his own team.  ", "Following an internal investigation, the CBA deemed Guanghui to have committed \"registration violations\" in the signing of Zhou in February.   ", "This included transferring business operations without formal approval, and not being in accordance with the league's hiring and salary regulations over the last three seasons.  ", "The result of that investigation has since ignited a full-blown rift between Zhou and his team.  ", "Most explosive are his accusations of bullying by team manager Guo Jian and club president Hou Wei, who according to Zhou went back on their word and hindered him from participating in NBA events in the US.   ", "He provided photos and screenshots of documents supposedly backing up all of his claims.  ", "\"The two chairmans, Guo Jian and Hou Wei, and the management, have bullied me and lied to me for many years. I couldn't bear it. I still couldn't decide my own future as an adult in 2023,\" Zhou wrote in a lengthy post on Chinese social media platform Weibo.  ", "CNN has reached out to the team for comment.  ", "Zhou has long been touted as Yao's successor as a generational talent given his towering seven-foot-one (216 centimeters) height and previous experience playing with NBA team Houston Rockets - the same team that Yao was drafted to in 2002.  ", "This would have been Zhou's third stint with the Flying Tigers, having played between 2014-2017 and 2019-2021.  ", "The saga has sparked heavy interest on China's social media, where fans have flocked to discuss how Yao would react to the scandal and theories on who is ultimately to blame.  ", "\"There are no winners from this\" and \"the biggest victims are the fans\" were among the most-liked comments. More angry users have rounded on Yao and described the furore as a \"nuclear explosion in the basketball world\".  ", "CNN has reached out to the CBA for comment.  ", "Basketball commands a huge following in China primarily thanks to Yao's Hall of Fame career in the NBA.  ", "NBA viewership last year nearly returned to the levels seen before Chinese broadcasters' 16-month blackout in 2019, according to Reuters. That is an estimated 500 to 800 million viewers through the season.  ", "The CBA, though comparatively less popular, did see pre-Covid audience increases since Yao took charge in 2017.  ", "In its statement Guanghui argues that the CBA \"made serious mistakes in its unreasonable and absurd 'punishment'\".  ", "\"After careful consideration, (Guanghui) has solemnly decided to: stop playing this season; and quit the CBA,\" it said.  ", "The team then took aim at Yao and the CBA of mismanagement, and Zhou for allegedly repeatedly discrediting the team.  ", "\"Since 2017, Yao Ming has held the position of both chairman of the Association and the League. The management of each are intertwined and confused, and the basketball industry is full of chaos,\" Guanghui said.  ", "Even after retirement Yao has remained one of China's most recognisable international faces, acting as a prominent ambassador for sports and fronting a number of charitable causes including campaigns against the ivory trade and consuming shark fins.  ", "Commenting on the Flying Tiger's withdrawal, Yao told the state-run China National Radio on Wednesday that the Xinjiang club had made \"huge contributions\" to Chinese basketball in the past 20 years.  ", "\"We respect its decision and express regret,\" Yao said. \"Our top priority now is to bring the league and the games back to the fans.\"  ", "Zhou also responded to Guanhui's broadside with in a lengthy statement of his own on Weibo, calling the revelations \"fake news.\"  ", "\"I admire the 'creativity' of (Guanghui) regarding the violations. Sadly, it has been unable to turn around on its road of deception. It's gone further downhill\".   ", "He concluded that the CBA's penalty on Xinjiang \"is fair and objective\".  ", "Xinjiang, alongside then-All Star Zhou, won their first and only CBA Championship in 2017.  ", "Guanghui's withdrawal comes one week after soccer team Xinjiang Tianshan Leopard FC withdrew from China's League One division after dissolving.   ", "The next most popular sport after basketball, Chinese soccer is reeling from its own post-Covid financial difficulties as well as a crackdown on corruption at the highest administrative levels.  ", "A total of six clubs from its marquee Chinese Super League withdrew - and folded - during the pandemic, with dozens more across all divisions.   ", "Many of those who remain are struggling to pay the salaries of players and staff - some even filing appeals to world governing body FIFA.  ", "Meanwhile, a former national team head coach, former national team director, and former Chinese Football Association secretary-general are under investigation by China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection for suspected \"serious violations of party discipline and the law\".

CNN cannot independently verify the destruction of the data.  ", "Wuxi also scrapped more than 40 local apps used for \"digital epidemic prevention,\" according to the statement.

It's also generated fierce pushback from China.  ", "\"We urge the US to respect science and facts, stop politicizing this issue, stop its intelligence-led, politics-driven origins-tracing,\" a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday.  ", "The Department of Energy assessment is part of a broader US effort in which intelligence agencies were asked by President Joe Biden in 2021 to examine the origins of the coronavirus, which was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan.   ", "That overall assessment from the intelligence community was inconclusive, and then, as now, there has yet to be a decisive link established between the virus and a specific animal or other route - as China continues to stonewall international investigations into the origins of the virus.  ", "Four agencies and the National Intelligence Council assessed with low confidence that the virus likely jumped from animals to humans through natural exposure, while one assessed with moderate confidence that the pandemic was the result of a laboratory-related accident. Three other intelligence community elements were unable to coalesce around either explanation without additional information, according to a declassified version of the 2021 report.  ", "The majority of agencies remain undecided or lean toward the virus having a natural origin - a hypothesis also widely favored by scientists with expertize in the field. But the change from the US Department of Energy has now deepened the split in the intelligence community, especially as the director of the FBI this week commented publicly for the first time on his agency's similar determination made with \"medium confidence.\"  ", "Intelligence agencies can make assessments with either low, medium or high confidence. A low confidence assessment generally means the information obtained is not reliable enough, or is too fragmented to make a more definitive judgment.  ", "And while the assessment and new commentary has pulled the theory back into the spotlight, neither agency has released evidence or information backing their determinations. That raises crucial questions about their basis - and shines the spotlight back on gaping, outstanding unknowns and need for further research.   ", "Scientists largely believe the virus most likely emerged from a natural spillover from an infected animal to people, as many viruses before it, though they widely acknowledge the need for more research of all options. Many have also questioned the lack of data released to substantiate the latest claim.  ", "Virologist Thea Fischer, who in 2021 traveled to Wuhan as part of a World Health Organization (WHO) origins probe and remains a part of ongoing WHO tracing efforts, said it was \"very important\" that any new assessments related to the origin of the virus are documented by evidence.   ", "\"(These are) strong accusations against a public research laboratory in China and can't stand alone without substantial evidence,\" said Fischer, a professor at the University of Copenhagen.  ", "\"Hopefully they will share with the WHO soon so the evidence can be known and assessed by international health experts just as all other evidence concerning the pandemic origin.\"  ", "A senior US intelligence official told the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the new Department of Energy assessment, that the update to the assessment was conducted in light of new intelligence, further study of academic literature and in consultation with experts outside government.  ", "The idea that the virus could have emerged from a lab accident became more prominent as a spotlight was turned on coronavirus research being done at local facilities, such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It was further enhanced amid a failure to find a \"smoking gun\" showing which animal could have passed the virus to people at Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market - the location linked to a number of early known cases - amid limitations to follow-up research.  ", "Some experts who have been closely involved in examining existing information, however, are skeptical of the new assessment giving the theory more weight.  ", "\"Given that so much of the data we have points to a spillover event occurring at the Huanan market in late 2019 I doubt there's anything very significant in it or new information that would change our current understanding,\" said David Robertson, a professor in the University of Glasgow's School of Infection and Immunity, who was involved in recent research with findings that supported the natural origin theory.  ", "He noted that locations of early human cases centered on the market, positive environmental samples, and confirmation that live animals susceptible to the virus were for sale there are among evidence supporting the natural origins theory - while there's no data supporting a lab leak.  ", "\"The extent of this evidence continually gets lost (in media discussion) ... when in fact we know a lot about what happened, and arguably more than other outbreaks,\" he said.  ", "Efforts to understand how the pandemic started have been further complicated by China's lack of transparency - especially as the origin question spiraled into another point of bitter contention within rising US-China tensions of recent years.   ", "Beijing has blocked robust, long-term international field investigations and refused to allow a laboratory audit, which could bring clarity, and been reticent to share details and data around domestic research to uncover the cause. However, it repeatedly maintains that it has been transparent and cooperative with the WHO.  ", "Chinese officials carefully controlled the single WHO-backed investigation it did allow on the ground in 2021, citing disease control measures to restrict visiting experts to their hotel rooms for half their trip and to prevent them from sharing meals with their Chinese counterparts - cutting off an opportunity for more informal information sharing.  ", "Citing data protection, Beijing has also declined to allow its own investigatory measures, like testing stored blood samples from Wuhan or combing through hospital data for potential \"patient zeros,\" to be verified by researchers outside the country.  ", "China has fiercely denied that the virus emerged from a lab accident, and has repeatedly tried to assert it could have arrived in the country for the initial outbreak from elsewhere - including a US laboratory, without offering any evidence supporting the claim.

That decision could mean that after March 31, the drug will only be available to those who can afford to pay full price, with current rates reportedly around 1,900 yuan ($280) per course.

Experts say procurement appears to be decentralized, with the pills more readily available at hospitals in better resourced major cities and tougher to find elsewhere.

", "However, if the drug developer was unwilling to take that step - as Bourla indicated Pfizer was on Monday - there are measures China could take, such as pledging to protect companies that make generic supplies or importing generics from elsewhere, using legal measures allowed under the World Trade Organization rules during health emergencies, 't Hoen said.

Cars, cargo trucks, lorries and other vehicles can be seen in the pileup.  ", "In videos filmed from the ground, the air is still thick with fog. One clip shows a truck sliding forward, crashing into several smaller cars, as sirens ring in the distance.   ", "Many drivers and passengers were trapped in their cars, according to The Global Times.

Several hours after the pileup, police had issued a warning for cars not to cross the bridge due to the fog.

", "Instead, China had its most difficult year under Xi's rule as it reeled from his costly zero-Covid policy - from months of overzealous enforcement that crushed the economy and stoked historic public discontent, to a wholesale abandonment so abrupt that left a fragile health system scrambling to cope with an explosion of cases.  ", "The chaos and disarray is a stark contrast to the start of the year, when Beijing showcased the success of its Covid containment measures by keeping the coronavirus largely at bay from the Winter Olympics.  ", "Over the span of a year, Xi's hallmark pandemic policy has turned from a source of legitimacy for the ruling Communist Party into a spiraling crisis that threatens to undermine it.  ", "As an unprecedented wave of infections - and deaths - sweeps the country, many have questioned why after sacrificing so much under zero-Covid and waiting for so long to reopen, the government ultimately let the virus rip through a population with little prior warning or preparation.  ", "As 2022 draws to a close, CNN looks back at five key events of the year for China's zero-Covid policy.  ", "The Games proved to be a resounding success for China's zero-Covid strategy.  ", "In its tightly sealed, meticulously managed Olympic bubble, the ubiquitous face masks, endless spraying of disinfectant and rigorous daily testing paid-off. Any infected visitors arriving in the country were swiftly identified and their cases contained, allowing the Winter Olympics to run largely free of Covid even as the Omicron variant raged around the world.  ", "The success added to the party's narrative that its political system is superior to those of Western democracies in handling the pandemic - a message Xi had repeatedly driven home as he prepared for a third term in power.  ", "It also boosted China's confidence that its well-honed zero-Covid playbook of lockdowns, quarantines, mass testing and contact tracing could build an effective defense against highly transmissible Omicron and contain its spread. In the lead-up to the Games, these measures worked in January to tame the country's first Omicron outbreak in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing.  ", "But it didn't take long for Omicron to seep through the cracks of zero-Covid. By mid-March, China was battling its worst Covid outbreak since the initial wave of the pandemic, reporting thousands of new cases a day, from northern Jilin province to Guangdong in the south.  ", "The financial hub of Shanghai soon became the epicenter. Local officials initially denied a citywide lockdown was necessary, but then imposed one after the city reported 3,500 daily infections.  ", "The two-month lockdown became a glaring symbol of the economic and social costs of zero-Covid. In the country's wealthiest and most glamorous city, residents were subject to widespread food shortages, lack of emergency medical care, spartan makeshift isolation facilities and forced disinfection of their homes. The draconian measures triggered wave after wave of outcry, severely eroding public trust in the Shanghai government.   ", "The lockdown also wracked havoc on the economy. China's GDP shrunk by 2.6% in the three months ending in June, while youth unemployment hit a record high of nearly 20%.  ", "But the costly lockdown did not prod China to shift away from its zero-tolerance approach. Rather, officials hailed it as a victory in the war against Covid. Other local governments came away with the lesson that they must curb infections at all cost, before outbreaks spiraled out of control.   ", "As the party's all-important national congress approached, the pressure only grew.  ", "Having tied himself so closely to zero-Covid, Xi was stuck in a trap of his own making. He couldn't afford to move away from it, the potential surge of infections and deaths posing too great a risk to his authority before he secured his norm-shattering third term at the congress.  ", "And so instead of vaccinating the elderly and bolstering ICU capacity, authorities wasted the next crucial months building larger quarantine facilities, rolling out more frequent mass testing, and imposing wider lockdowns that at one point affected more than 300 million people.  ", "But even the most stringent measures failed to tame Omicron's spread. By October, China was reporting thousands of daily infections again. Amid mounting public frustration, the People's Daily, the party's main mouthpiece, insisted zero-Covid is \"sustainable\" and the country's \"best choice.\"  ", "At the opening of the congress, Xi gave a sweeping endorsement of his Covid policy, saying it had \"prioritized the people and their lives above all else.\" He scored a big political victory, securing a third term and stacking the party's top ranks with staunch allies - including those who had loyally carried out his Covid policies.  ", "Officials took the hint and became ever more zealous in enforcing zero-Covid, dashing hopes that the country could open up after the congress.   ", "As restrictions tightened, more suffering and tragedy emerged from the unrelenting lockdowns.  ", "Migrant workers abandoned a locked-down Foxconn factory en masse, walking for miles to escape an outbreak at China's largest iPhone assembling site. A 3-year-old boy died of gas poisoning in lockdown after he was blocked from being taken promptly to a hospital. A 4-month-old girl died in hotel quarantine after a 12-hour delay in medical care.  ", "Then, in late November, a deadly apartment fire in the western city of Urumqi finally ignited public anger that had been simmering for months. Many believed lockdown measures had hampered rescue efforts, despite official denials.  ", "Protests erupted across the country, on a scale unseen in decades. On university campuses and the streets of major cities, crowds gathered to call for an end to incessant Covid tests and lockdowns, with some decrying censorship and demanding greater political freedoms.  ", "In Shanghai, protesters even demanded that Xi step down - an unimaginable act of political defiance toward the country's most powerful and authoritarian leader in decades.  ", "The nationwide demonstrations posed an unprecedented challenge to Xi. By then, Omicron had seemingly spun out of control, with the country logging a daily record of more than 40,000 infections, and the economic strain becoming too severe, with local governments running out of cash to pay huge lockdown bills.  ", "In an apparent effort to appease protesters, some cities began to loosen restrictions.   ", "Then, on December 7, the central government announced a drastic overhaul of approach, rolling back lockdowns, testing and allowing residents to isolate at home - effectively abandoning zero-Covid.  ", "State media and health officials have since flipped from preaching the dangers of the virus to downplaying its threat.   ", "While the easing of stifling restrictions is a long-awaited relief for many, the abruptness and haphazardness of it has caught an unprepared public off guard and left them to fend for themselves.  ", "Over-the-counter cold and fever medicines - which had been restricted from purchase under zero-Covid - sold out instantly at pharmacies and on online shopping sites. Huge lines have formed outside fever clinics and hospital emergency rooms overflow with patients, many elderly. Crematoriums are struggling to keep up with an influx of bodies.  ", "Amid the chaos, the government has stopped reporting the bulk of the country's Covid infections and narrowed its criteria of counting Covid deaths in a way that the World Health Organization warned would \"very much underestimate the true death toll.\"  ", "While that move has taken the public's panic into consideration, the political undertones are also hard to miss.  ", "For nearly three years, China's low Covid caseload and death count compared with countries like the United States had been held up as a measure of the party's merit and legitimacy.  ", "Now, the true scale of the outbreak and deaths could deal a serious blow to the credibility of a government that had justified years of painful restrictions on the grounds that they were necessary to save lives.  ", "Some studies have estimated China's abrupt and under-prepared reopening could lead to nearly a million deaths - close to the Covid death toll of the US.  ", "As China enters its third - and darkest - pandemic winter, zero-Covid is finally dead, but the fallout from its demise will haunt the country into the next year.
