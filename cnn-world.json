      "Tensions are mounting in Moldova, a small country on Ukraine's southwestern border, where Russia has been accused of laying the groundwork for a coup that could drag the nation into the Kremlin's war. ",
      "Moldova's President, Maia Sandu, has accused Russia of using \"saboteurs\" disguised as civilians to stoke unrest amid a period of political instability, echoing similar warnings from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  ",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has meanwhile baselessly accused Kyiv of planning its own assault on a pro-Russian territory in Moldova where Moscow has a military foothold, heightening fears that he is creating a pretext for a Crimea-style annexation.   ",
      "US President Joe Biden met President Sandu on the sidelines of his trip to Warsaw last week, marking the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion.  ",
      "Although there is no sign he has accepted her invite to visit, the White House did say he reaffirmed support for Moldova's \"sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"  ",
      "Here's what you need to know.  ",
      "Earlier this month, Zelensky warned that Ukrainian intelligence intercepted a Russian plan to destabilize an already volatile political situation in Moldova.  ",
      "The recent resignation of the country's prime minister followed an ongoing period of crises, headlined by soaring gas prices and sky-high inflation. Moldova's new prime minister has continued the government's pro-EU drive, but pro-Russian protests have since taken place in the capital, Chisinau, backed by a fringe, pro-Moscow political party.   ",
      "Amid the tensions, Moldova's President Sandu issued a direct accusation that Russia was seeking to take advantage of the situation.  ",
      "Sandu said the government last fall had planned for \"a series of actions involving saboteurs who have undergone military training and are disguised as civilians to carry out violent actions, attacks on government buildings and hostage-taking.\"  ",
      "Sandu also claimed individuals disguised as \"the so-called opposition\" were going to try forcing a change of power in Chisinau through \"violent actions.\" CNN is unable to independently verify those claims.  ",
      "\"It's clear that these threats from Russia and the appetite to escalate the war towards us is very high,\" Iulian Groza, Moldova's former deputy foreign minister and now the director of the Chisinau-based Institute for European Policies and Reforms, told CNN.  ",
      "\"Moldova is the most affected country after Ukraine (by) the war,\" he said. \"We are still a small country, which has still an under-developed economy, and that creates a lot of pressure.\"  ",
      "Despite Moscow's pleas of innocence, its actions regarding Moldova bear a striking resemblance to moves it made ahead of its annexation of Crimea in 2014, and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.  ",
      "On Tuesday, Putin revoked a 2012 foreign policy decree that in part recognized Moldova's independence, according to Reuters.   ",
      "Then on Thursday, Russia's Ministry of Defense accused Ukraine of \"preparing an armed provocation\" against Moldova's pro-Russian separatist region of Transnistria \"in the near future,\" state-media TASS reported.   ",
      "No evidence or further details were offered to support the ministry's accusation, and it has been rubbished by Moldova.   ",
      "But the claim has put Western leaders on alert, coming almost exactly a year after Putin made similar, unsubstantiated claims that Russians were being targeted in the Donbas - the eastern flank of Ukraine where Moscow had supported militant separatists since 2014 - allowing him to cast his invasion of the country as an issue of self-defense.  ",
      "\"It was the case before - we have seen constant activities of Russia trying to explore and exploit the information space in Moldova using propaganda,\" Groza said.  ",
      "\"With the war, all these instruments that Russia was using before have been multiplied and intensified,\" he said. \"What we see is a reactivation of Russian political proxies in Moldova.\"  ",
      "\"I do see lots of fingerprints of Russian forces, Russian services in Moldova,\" Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told CBS last Sunday. \"This is a very weak country, and we all need to help them.\"   ",
      "Central to Russia's interests in Moldova is Transnistria, a breakaway territory that slithers along the eastern flank of the country and has housed Russian troops for decades.  ",
      "The territory - a 1,300 square mile enclave on the eastern bank of the Dniester River - was the site of a Russian military outpost during the last years of the Cold War. It declared itself a Soviet republic in 1990, opposing any attempt by Moldova to become an independent state or to merge with Romania after the disintegration of the Soviet Union.  ",
      "When Moldova became independent the following year, Russia quickly inserted itself as a so-called \"peacekeeping force\" in Transnistria, sending troops in to back pro-Moscow separatists there.  ",
      "War with Moldovan forces ensued, and the conflict ended in deadlock in 1992. Transnistria was not recognized internationally, even by Russia, but Moldovan forces left it a de facto breakaway state. That deadlock has left the territory and its estimated 500,000 inhabitants trapped in limbo, with Chisinau holding virtually no control over it to this day.  ",
      "Moldova is a country at a crossroads between east and west. Its government and most of its citizens want closer ties to the EU, and the country achieved candidacy status last year. But it's also home to a breakaway faction whose sentiment Moscow has eagerly sought to rile up.  ",
      "It has been a flashpoint on the periphery of Russia's invasion of Ukraine for the past year, with Russian missiles crossing into Moldovan airspace on several occasions, including earlier this month.   ",
      "A series of explosions in Transnistria last April spiked concerns that Putin was looking to drag the territory into his invasion.  ",
      "Russia's stuttering military progress since then had temporarily allayed those fears. But officials in Moldova have been warning the West that their country could be next on Putin's list.  ",
      "Last month, the head of Moldova's Security Service warned there is a \"very high\" risk that Russia will launch a new offensive in Moldova's east in 2023. Moldova is not a NATO member, making it more vulnerable to Putin's agenda.   ",
      "Should Russia launch a Spring offensive that centers on Ukraine's south, it may seek again to creep towards Odesa and then link up with Transnistria, essentially creating a land bridge that sweeps through southern Ukraine and inches even closer to NATO territory.  "

      "Russia launched a Soyuz spacecraft to replace a capsule that sprang a coolant leak in December, leaving two cosmonauts and one NASA astronaut without a ride home.  ",
      "Liftoff of the capsule, called the Soyuz MS-23, took place out of Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome launch site in Kazakhstan on Thursday at 7:24 p.m. ET, which is 5:24 a.m. Friday local time.  ",
      "The uncrewed spacecraft spent about two days in orbit, maneuvering toward the International Space Station. It then docked with the Poisk module - which is on the space station's Russian-run portion - just before 8 p.m. ET Saturday.  ",
      "The Soyuz MS-23 will be the return vehicle for cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin and NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, all of whom traveled to the space station aboard the Soyuz MS-22 capsule in September.   ",
      "Rather than flying with crew members aboard, the Soyuz MS-23 launched on Thursday with only a \"Zero-G indicator,\" which can be any object that is left in the cabin and is designed to float freely when the capsule enters microgravity. For this mission, the indicator is a teddy bear tethered by a string inside the cabin.    ",
      "About two months into the three men's journey, the MS-22 experienced a coolant leak, leaving the cabin at temperatures deemed unsafe for the crewmates to use for their return journey. The Russian space agency Roscosmos and NASA quickly worked to establish plans to send a replacement vehicle. Roscosmos officials said they had determined that the leak resulted from a small hole caused by an impact with a micrometeoroid.   ",
      "Plans to launch the rescue vehicle, however, were drawn into question when a Russian cargo ship, called Progress, experienced a similar coolant leak on February 11. Three days later, Roscosmos had said in a post on the social media site Telegram, that it would delay the Soyuz MS-23 launch until at least March while the agency investigated the cause of the Progress vehicle's coolant leak.  ",
      "On Tuesday, however, Roscosmos had said in an updated Telegram post that it had determined the cause of the Progress spacecraft leak was \"external influences.\"  ",
      "\"The Russians are continuing to take a very close look at both the Soyuz and the Progress coolant leaks,\" Dana Weigel, the space station's deputy manager for NASA, said during a Wednesday briefing.   ",
      "\"They formed a state commission that is assessing the anomalies,\" she added, noting that the team is analyzing potential causes from the time the capsules launched through their journey in orbit.  ",
      "Originally, Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub and NASA astronaut Loral O'Hara were expected to launch to the space station on March 16 aboard MS-23.   ",
      "Instead, Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio's time will be extended on the space station until they can return to Earth aboard Soyuz MS-23 later this year. That return could happen in September, according to a report from Russia state-run media outlet TASS.  ",
      "If that timeline holds, the three crewmates will have extended their expected six-month stay in space to about one year.  ",
      "When asked about the extended stay, Joel Montalbano, the space station's program manager for NASA, said the crew remains in good health and there is no reason to expedite their journey home.  ",
      "The crew is \"willing to help wherever we ask,\" Montalbano said during a January 11 news conference. \"They're excited to be in space, excited to work and excited to do the research that we do on orbit. So they are ready to go with whatever decision that we give them.\"  ",
      "He added, \"I may have to fly some more ice cream to reward them.\"  ",
      "The launch of the Soyuz MS-23 spacecraft comes just days before NASA and SpaceX will launch their Crew-6 mission.

      "Shortly after those four arrive at the space station, NASA's Crew-5 astronauts will return home from their five-month stay there aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. NASA officials said this week that the coolant leaks experienced on the Soyuz and Progress vehicles would not have any impact on the SpaceX missions and that no similar issues were discovered on Crew Dragon vehicles.

      "When Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his forces into Ukraine a year ago, most observers expected a quick victory for the invaders.  ",
      "Those early predictions of Russian success have not materialized, for what experts cite as a variety of factors, including higher morale and superior military tactics on the Ukrainian side but also - crucially - the supply of Western armaments.  ",
      "While recent headlines have made much of the potential for Western battle tanks or Patriot air defense systems to influence the war's outcome, these systems have yet to be used in combat in Ukraine.  ",
      "But there are other weapons that have already helped to change the course of the war. Here are three key ones that the Ukrainians have used to devastating effect.  ",
      "At the very beginning of the war, fighters on both sides were expecting Russian armored columns to begin rolling into the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv within days.   ",
      "The Ukrainians needed something that could blunt that attack - and found it in the form of the Javelin, a shoulder-fired, guided anti-tank missile that can be deployed by a single individual.  ",
      "Part of its appeal lies in its ease of use, as manufacturer Lockheed Martin, which co-developed the missile with Raytheon, explains: \"To fire, the gunner places a cursor over the selected target. The Javelin command launch unit then sends a lock-on-before-launch signal to the missile.\"  ",
      "The Javelin is a \"fire and forget\" weapon. As soon as its operator takes the shot, they are able to run for cover while the missile finds its way to the target.  ",
      "This was particularly important in the early days of the war as the Russians tended to stay in columns when trying to enter urban areas. A Javelin operator could fire from a building or behind a tree and be gone before the Russians could fire back.  ",
      "The Javelin is also good at targeting the weak spot of the Russian tanks - their horizontal surfaces - because its trajectory after launch sees it curve upwards then fall on the target from above, according to Lockheed Martin.  ",
      "This could be seen in images early in the war of Russian tanks with their turrets blown off. Often, it was a Javelin that had done the damage.  ",
      "Indeed, so great was the Javelins' impact that two-and-a-half months into the war US President Joe Biden visited the Alabama plant where they are made to praise the workforce for their help in defending Ukraine.  ",
      "\"You're making a gigantic difference for these poor sons of guns who are under such enormous, enormous pressure and firepower,\" Biden said at the time.  ",
      "There was one other advantage to the Javelins, particularly pertinent at the start of the war: they were politically acceptable.  ",
      "\"Their low cost and defensive usage make them politically easier for other countries to provide,\" Michael Armstrong, an associate professor at Brock University in Ontario, wrote on the Conversation. \"By contrast, governments disagree about sending more expensive offensive weapons like warplanes.\"  ",
      "The full US Army name is the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System. It's \"a full-spectrum, combat-proven, all-weather, 24/7, lethal and responsive, wheeled precision strike weapons system,\" the US Army says.  ",
      "That's a mouthful, but to put it more plainly, HIMARS is a 5-ton truck carrying a pod that can launch six rockets almost simultaneously, sending their explosive warheads well beyond the battlefield's front lines, and then quickly change positions to avoid a counterstrike.  ",
      "\"If Javelin was the iconic weapon of the early phases of the war, HIMARS is the iconic weapon of the later phases,\" Mark Cancian, senior adviser for the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International studies, wrote in January.  ",
      "HIMARS fires munitions called the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) that have a range of 70 to 80 kilometers (about 50 miles). And their GPS guidance systems make them extremely accurate, within about 10 meters (33 feet) of their intended target.  ",
      "Last July, Russian reporter Roman Sapenkov said he witnessed a HIMARS strike on a Russian base at Kherson's airport in territory Moscow's forces had occupied at the time.  ",
      "\"I was struck by the fact that the whole packet, five or six rockets, landed practically on a penny,\" he wrote.  ",
      "HIMARS has had two key effects, Yagil Henkin, a professor at the Israel Defense Forces Command and Staff College, wrote for the US Marine Corps University Press.  ",
      "The strikes have forced \"the Russians to move their ammunition depots farther to the rear, thereby reducing the available firepower of Russian artillery near the front lines and making logistical support more difficult,\" Henkin wrote.  ",
      "And using the long-range rockets to hit targets such as bridges has disrupted Russian supply efforts, he said.  ",
      "The HIMARS system is manufactured and patented in the United States by Lockheed Martin.  ",
      "The Turkish-designed drone has become one of the world's best-known unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) due to its use in the Ukraine war.  ",
      "It's relatively cheap, made with off-the-shelf parts, packs a lethal punch and records its kills on video.  ",
      "Those videos have shown it taking out Russian armor, artillery and supply lines with the missiles, laser-guided rockets and smart bombs it carries.  ",
      "\"Viral videos of the TB2 are a perfect example of modern warfare in the TikTok era,\" Aaron Stein, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, wrote on the Atlantic Council's website.  ",
      "The Bayraktar TB2 was not a \"magic weapon,\" but it was \"good enough,\" he wrote.  ",
      "He cited as its weaknesses its lack of speed and vulnerability to air defenses. Battlefield statistics appear to bear that out. Seventeen of the 40 to 50 TB2s that Ukraine has received have been destroyed in combat, according to the Oryx open source intelligence website.  ",
      "But Stein says the number of losses are outweighed by the low cost of the drone, which means they can be relatively easily replaced.  ",
      "Indeed, a plan to set up an assembly line for the drones in Ukraine was in the works even before the war. And using the drones potentially has saved the lives of Ukrainian pilots who would otherwise have had to carry out the missions.  ",
      "Recent reports from Ukraine indicate the TB2 may be playing less of a role as Russian forces figure out how to combat it, yet its fans say it delivered when Ukraine's position was most precarious.  ",
      "Its videos of Russian kills were \"a great morale booster,\" Samuel Bendett, adjunct senior fellow at the Center of Naval Analyses Russia Studies (CNAS), told CNN early in the war.   ",
      "\"It's a public relations victory.\"   ",
      "The TB2 even had a music video made about it. That's the status it has attained among Ukrainians.  "

      "Seven months since he announced his resignation as prime minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson's shadow still looms large over the\u00a0ruling\u00a0Conservative party.  ",
      "Despite being forced from office in disgrace and presiding over a massive decline in support for both himself and his party, Johnson is still attempting to influence government policy. His supporters say his interventions are the Conservatives' last hopes at saving the party from decimation at the next election. His\u00a0critics think he is not only undermining current PM Rishi Sunak, but, by reminding voters - with\u00a0many of\u00a0whom he is unpopular - of his existence, he is damaging\u00a0his\u00a0party's\u00a0electoral prospects.  ",
      "A quick recap: Johnson was forced to resign after multiple ethics scandals made his position untenable.\u00a0Those\u00a0scandals\u00a0included the notorious \"Partygate\" where Johnson became the first sitting PM to be found guilty of breaking the law\u00a0by holding illegal gatherings during the pandemic lockdown. The final straw came for Johnson after\u00a0it\u00a0allegations emerged that his deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, had been sexually harassing party members while drunk. Johnson hired Pincher despite\u00a0being aware of\u00a0rumors about his conduct.  ",
      "Johnson has spent much of the past week leaving Westminster guessing as to whether or not he is going to publicly come out against Sunak as he attempts to negotiate an agreement with the European Union to fix part of the 2019 Brexit deal. It is worth noting that Johnson himself negotiated and signed that deal, calling it \"oven ready\" during his\u00a0election campaign\u00a0that same year.  ",
      "The part of the deal causing all the problems is the Northern Ireland Protocol, an arrangement that theoretically prevents a hard border between Northern Ireland, which left the EU along with the rest of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state. Both sides agree a border should not exist for fears of provoking tensions and violence.\u00a0Northern Ireland has been largely peaceful since a 1998 accord ended the three-decades-long \"Troubles,\" in which more than 3,500 people were killed.  ",
      "The UK has not implemented the protocol in full for fears it would damage trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Northern Irish\u00a0pro-British\u00a0unionists claim the protocol cuts the province off from the rest of the UK, while hardline English Brexiteers believe the protocol - and any deal Sunak might make to revive it - is essentially a capitulation to the EU, despite\u00a0them\u00a0supporting the deal in 2019.  ",
      "Those hardliners, along with Johnson, believe that Sunak should specifically not abandon a piece of proposed legislation that Johnson introduced during his time in office, the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which allows the UK government to rip up parts of the protocol. Critics say this would break international law. The constant noise and anticipation of a Johnson intervention has effectively killed talks of an agreement being reached with the EU and left many questioning Sunak's strength to deliver as PM.  ",
      "Johnson has also publicly implored Sunak to become the first\u00a0Western\u00a0leader\u00a0to\u00a0send fighter jets to Ukraine as the conflict marks its 12-month anniversary.  ",
      "The vast majority of MPs that CNN spoke with are sick of Johnson's \"attention seeking,\" as many of them described it. They all declined to speak on the record for fear of derailing Northern Ireland talks which, as many of them were quick to say, is a very dangerous situation, pointing to the shooting of a detective that took place in the province just this week.  ",
      "\"I just wish he would get on side and realize that his efforts would be best spent supporting Rishi,\" said a former government minister who served under Johnson. \"The next election is going to be hard enough without this distraction. Boris is still popular in certain parts of the country that we might lose seats. He should be up there campaigning, not teasing a return to the frontline.\"  ",
      "Another government minister who also served under Johnson is less optimistic about Johnson's ability to help, even if he wanted to.  ",
      "\"He is fundamentally too selfish to want to help the people who he no doubt believes kicked him out of office unfairly,\" the former minister said. \"And he is unpopular enough that the prospect of him returning to the frontline could be one of the biggest motivating factors for people to vote against us.\"  ",
      "The polls back up this theory. A recent Ipsos MORI survey revealed that Johnson is still less trusted than either Sunak or leader of the opposition Keir Starmer. Poll after poll on the outcome at the next general election predicts the Conservatives suffering heavy losses. The dip in the Conservative's fortunes can be traced directly back to the start of the Partygate scandal. Before that, Johnson was enjoying an unusually high level of support, thanks in large part to the UK's successful Covid vaccine roll-out.  ",
      "Johnson's supporters don't entirely believe the polls and challenge the narrative that he is responsible for the collapse in the Conservatives' support, claiming instead it was due to a media obsession with Partygate.  ",
      "One Johnson loyalist told CNN that \"people forget he won us the largest majority since Margaret Thatcher\" and believes he is still \"a giant\" in the eyes of the public. His supporters in the party welcome his interventions, with one saying of the Northern Ireland debate, still taking aim at the press,\u00a0that the media \"should welcome the widest possible debate on this major constitutional issue for our nation.\"  ",
      "Other Conservatives fear that the Johnson loyalists, who are mostly at the harder end of the Brexit-supporting spectrum, will learn the hard way that their assumptions are wrong.  ",
      "\"Most of his supporters in parliament have either already decided to stand down at the next election, probably because they know the writing is on the wall, or stand a very good chance of losing their seat,\" the former government\u00a0minister\u00a0said.  ",
      "A senior Conservative and former cabinet minister who worked in government with Johnson\u00a0looks on with some degree of bewilderment. \"I don't really know what these hardline Brexiters are hoping to achieve. The public largely views Brexit as a mistake, so why double down on it so aggressively,\" they\u00a0\u00a0mused.  ",
      "There are an increasing number of Conservatives who look at the polls and think a heavy loss at the next general election is inevitable. They see one\u00a0big\u00a0advantage of Johnson returning to the frontline:\u00a0that him\u00a0lose\u00a0losing\u00a0might finally kill the myth that he is the\u00a0\"chosen one\"\u00a0and finally draw a line under the\u00a0whole\u00a0Johnson experiment.  ",
      "It seems unlikely that Johnson\u00a0will end his agitation from\u00a0the backbenches, especially over policies that he believes might trash his legacy. However, the louder he shouts and\u00a0the\u00a0harder he stamps his feet, the biggest threat to the Johnson legacy could easily become Boris Johnson himself. Whether he brings down his party too seems a matter that doesn't\u00a0unduly\u00a0bother many of his supporters.  "

      "Mexico is rethinking its approach toward asylum seekers after the Biden administration unveiled a controversial new proposal to limit asylum eligibility in the United States.  ",
      "Mexico's refugee assistance agency, known as COMAR, launched a pilot program in southern Mexico on Monday to explore expediting asylum denials to those it deems likely to travel onward to the US.  ",
      "The aim is to deter those migrants from accessing temporary documents issued by COMAR while their cases are being evaluated, which they might use to travel north - a common phenomenon, according to COMAR's head Andr\u00e9s Ram\u00edrez.  ",
      "But after the Biden administration announced its proposed new asylum rules on Tuesday, COMAR plans to abandon the strategy and use what it learned from the pilot program to come up with a different solution, Ram\u00edrez said.  ",
      "The US proposal - which has been panned by human rights advocates and immigration experts - largely bars migrants who have not taken a legal pathway and instead traveled through other countries on their way to the US southern border from applying for asylum in the US. It would take effect in May.  ",
      "Among its proposed new conditions on eligibility for US asylum: being denied protection in a third country through which they traveled.  ",
      "Ram\u00edrez now worries that accelerating asylum denials could actually increase Mexico's attractiveness as a pit stop for those ultimately aiming to request asylum in the US.   ",
      "\"The new policy that was recently announced [by the United States] changes the whole thing. We need to rethink it,\" Ram\u00edrez said.  ",
      "Migrant numbers at the US-Mexico border have been on the rise since last year, with increasing numbers of people from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua and Colombia - many fleeing repressive government and stark economic pressures.   ",
      "Though the one-week pilot program did not include actually issuing swift denials, it studied behaviors of individuals from nationalities deemed by COMAR most likely to be traveling for economic reasons rather than for international protection - Senegalese and Angolan migrants in particular, according to Ram\u00edrez.  ",
      "By Mexican law, asylum seekers are required to stay in the state where they filed for asylum to see the process through.   ",
      "Once registered with COMAR, asylum seekers are provided with deportation protection, access to the public health care system and work eligibility.  ",
      "Ram\u00edrez says that his agency recently noticed that many migrants who began the asylum process in the city of Tapachula, in southern Mexico, later abandoned the process. They used a preliminary COMAR document to travel within the country toward its northern border.  ",
      "\"They are abusing the system,\" said Ram\u00edrez. \"That shows us that many of these people are not really interested in (Mexico's) refugee system and the asylum procedure.\"  ",
      "He estimated that in Tapachula, Mexico about 70% of the individuals from countries other than Haiti were abusing the system.  ",
      "Haitians, he said, have been continuing with the local asylum process there at a higher rate.  ",
      "Mexico has received a surge of asylum applications in recent years, Ram\u00edrez says.  ",
      "In January 2023, nearly 13,000 people signed up to seek asylum in Mexico, according to COMAR data. That's more than double the number of asylum registrations from one year ago in January 2022, the data shows.   ",
      "If applications continue at this pace, 2023 could be on track to becoming the refugee agency's busiest year ever.  ",
      "The record for most applications ever was set in 2021, he said, when COMAR received nearly 130,000 asylum applications.  ",

      "And despite claiming the \"sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries must be effectively upheld,\" the document fails to acknowledge Russia's violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.  ",
      "Moscow and Kyiv have both showed some interest in the position paper, but their responses on Friday also emphasized the enormous obstacles to dialogue.  ",
      "The Russian Foreign Ministry said it \"highly appreciates the sincere desire\" of China to contribute to settling the conflict, and added that Moscow is open to achieving the goals of its so-called special military operation through political and diplomatic means, including the recognition of \"new territorial realities\" - something which Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has sworn never to concede.   ",
      "Zelensky appeared open to speaking with China, telling a Friday news conference that he was pleased China was beginning to talk about how to end Ukraine's conflict with Russia - but asked what steps might follow Beijing's words. He said that China talked about territorial integrity in general terms but had not specified any country, adding that Ukraine needed to work on these issues with China.    ",
      "\"It doesn't say whose territorial integrity but our country's territorial integrity has been violated,\" Zelensky said.   ",
      "When asked how he would bring countries geopolitically removed from Ukraine onto his side, Zelensky said: \"As far as I know, China respects territorial integrity, historically, has respected it and therefore must do whatever they can for the Russian Federation to leave our territory because that would mean respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"  ",
      "Much of the language used in the document appears targeted at the West. In a thinly veiled criticism of the United States, the paper said, \"Cold War mentality\" should be abandoned.  ",
      "\"The security of a region should not be achieved by strengthening or expanding military blocs. The legitimate security interests and concerns of all countries must be taken seriously and addressed properly,\" it said, apparently echoing Moscow's view the West provoked the war through the expansion of NATO.  ",
      "It also appears to criticize the wide-ranging economic sanctions imposed by the US and other Western countries on Russia. \"Unilateral sanctions and maximum pressure cannot solve the issue; they only create new problems,\" it said. \"Relevant countries should stop abusing unilateral sanctions and 'long-arm jurisdiction' against other countries, so as to do their share in deescalating the Ukraine crisis.\"  ",
      "The paper was swiftly criticized by American officials, with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan saying the war \"could end tomorrow if Russia stopped attacking Ukraine and withdrew its forces.\"  ",
      "\"My first reaction to it is that it could stop at point one, which is to respect the sovereignty of all nations,\" Sullivan told CNN. \"Ukraine wasn't attacking Russia. NATO wasn't attacking Russia. The United States wasn't attacking Russia. This was a war of choice waged by Putin.\"  ",
      "In Beijing, the ambassador of the European Union to China, Jorge Toledo, told reporters at a briefing that China's position paper was not a peace proposal, adding that the EU is \"studying the paper closely,\" according to Reuters.   ",
      "Ukraine, meanwhile, called the position paper \"a good sign\" but urged China to do more.  ",
      "\"China should do everything in its power to stop the war and restore peace in Ukraine and urge Russia to withdraw its troops,\" Ukraine's Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires to China Zhanna Leshchynska said at the same briefing in Beijing.  ",
      "\"In neutrality, China should talk to both sides: Russia and Ukraine, and now we can see China is not talking to Ukraine,\" she said, noting that Kyiv was not consulted before the release of the paper.  ",
      "The position paper was first discussed last week by top diplomat Wang Yi at a security conference in Munich, as he attempted to cast Beijing as a responsible negotiator for peace during a diplomatic charm offensive in Europe.   ",
      "Wang visited Moscow as the final stop of his European tour, and met with Putin on Wednesday.   ",
      "Putin, who welcomed Wang with outstretched arms as the Chinese diplomat entered the meeting room, said relations between Russia and China were \"reaching new milestones.\"  ",
      "\"Russian-Chinese relations are developing as we planned in previous years. Everything is moving forward and developing,\" Putin told reporters as he sat beside Wang. \"Cooperation in the international arena between the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China, as we have repeatedly said, is very important for stabilizing the international situation.\"  ",
      "Wang said the two countries \"often face crisis and chaos, but there are always opportunities in a crisis.\"  ",
      "\"This requires us to identify changes more voluntarily and respond to the changes more actively to further strengthen our comprehensive strategic partnership,\" Wang said.  "

      "\"I didn't believe it, then I came closer,\" he told CNN the next day. \"I had one of my colleagues with me. I asked him if he sees this dead man as my father. I looked around, waiting for anyone to say that I was mistaken. But it was my father.\"  ",
      "Since the beginning of the year, 62 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health - the highest number at this point in a year since the year 2000.

Suitcases, a cooler box, an empty television stand and a white leather couch were all that were left in his living room. A friend was on the way to pick up the sofa that afternoon.

      "\"We are meeting with you on the eve of Defender of the Fatherland Day,\" Putin said, referring to the February 23 holiday commonly known as Men's Day. \"In this phrase, in these words, there is something powerful, huge, I would say, mystical and holy.\"  ",

",
      "\"We have gathered here, in fact, for a festive event, but I know - just now I was listening to the country's top military leadership - that right at this moment, there is a battle going on on our historical borders for our people,\" Putin said. \"It is being led by the same courageous fighters who are now standing next to us here. They fight heroically, courageously, bravely. We are proud of them. We are proud, so three cheers in their honor!\"  ",
      "In his address before the Russian parliament the day previous, Putin made a rambling digression about what he described as Russia's traditional values under attack, making bizarre remarks about the West's promotion of \"perversions.\" At Luzhniki stadium, the Russian leader also cast his war on Ukraine as a campaign to defend the family.  ",
      "\"In our heart, Motherland and family is the same,\" Putin said to the crowd. \"The people standing here made a decision to defend the most sacred of what we have - family and Motherland.\"  ",
      "The concert that bookended Putin's appearance was a sort of pro-war Super Bowl halftime special, a fist-pumping version of the mass rallies of 20th century totalitarianism.   ",
      "The independent Russian Telegram channel SOTA reported that students had been corralled in dormitories to attend the rally; SOTA also posted a smartphone screenshot purportedly from the organizers of the concert that appeared to urge attendees to bring their friends.  ",

      "It also played to World War II nostalgia. The Great Patriotic War, as it is known in Russia, is a touchstone for many Russians and a cause frequently invoked by Putin.   ",
      "A camouflage-clad soldier performed a rap version of Katyusha, the patriotic Soviet wartime anthem, and screens featured images of the Immortal Regiment, a modern-day commemoration of the war that has been promoted by the Kremlin.   ",
      "It also had a moment of cringe. The organizers ushered a group of children - described as children rescued from the Donbas region and the shattered Ukrainian city of Mariupol - and encouraged them to hug a uniformed man described as their rescuer.   ",
      "The images were particularly disturbing in the wake of a new report that the Russian government has been operating a network of camps where it has held thousands of Ukrainian children and undertaken a campaign of political re-education.  ",

      "BFMTV reported that, following the attack in the town of Saint-Jean-de-Luz, the assailant fled into a neighboring room where he told a teacher that a voice had told him to commit the attack. The teacher took the weapon from the student and remained with him until police arrived, BFMTV said.   ",

      "\"The louder the explosions, the louder I was praying,\" she said. \"When I heard the shooting, my knees and my hands started shaking and I started praying louder and with time the shivering would pass.\"    ",
      "She prayed when the Russians killed her dog and when they searched her home. She prayed when the soldiers spoke to her four-year-old granddaughter, who told them boldly that they should go away. She prayed when family members were told they could evacuate, only to be turned back when they tried.    ",
      "Yeshchenko is convinced the prayers were what got her through the worst of last year. She said that after the liberation, when the immediate danger had passed and she was left with her thoughts, she descended into a deep depression; at this point, she turned to praying again.     ",
      "A year ago, Yeshchenko rarely went to church and didn't consider religion a big part of her life. Now she spends her days working alongside Father Andriy at St. Andrew's. She sells candles, rosaries, and icons framed in gold, and patiently speaks to visiting delegations about the impacts of the war.     ",
      "She continues praying - including for her recently mobilized son who is currently fighting in Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine. \"Working here helps. And praying. I come home and read 'Our Father' 40 times,\" she said.    ",

      "For 31-year-old Nastia Mykolaietz and her husband, that aspiration became reality just four months before the war started. They bought an apartment in Bucha, right next to the modern Epicentr shopping mall. They moved in and started renovating the bathroom. They were enjoying their new life.     ",
      "The idyll didn't last long. On February 24, the family was woken up at 5 a.m. by Mykolaietz's mother, who called to urge them to leave immediately. They grabbed a few things - some clothes, a laptop and a potty for the little one - and ran. The plan was to take the kids to safety as quickly as possible, then return for more clothes and their cat, called Lisa. But they never made it back that day. Fighting in the area became too intense.    ",
      "They returned 47 days later, expecting to find their apartment destroyed and the cat dead.    ",
      "\"We arrived and she was there, completely bald and skinny, but alive,\" Mykolaietz said. \"She ate from the trash. The frozen berries in my fridge melted and that was the puddle she was drinking from. She was covered in berries.\"      ",
      "Returning was difficult for the family. The mall next to their home had been completely destroyed, shops were closed and supplies hard to find.     ",
      "Mykolaietz went to a Unicef help-point to see if she could get a doctor's consultation for her five-year-old son. After a few visits to the center, Mykolaietz, a former kindergarten teacher, found out there was a vacancy as a carer for children and took the job. Now she spends her days with local children, many of them deeply traumatized by the events of last year.  ",
      "\"My son is still scared of the noise of the airplane,\" she said. \"Today he woke up, he took his mask, his toy gun and said, 'This is my checkpoint, and I will defend it.'\"    ",

      "Iryna and Ivan Fedorov stayed in Bucha throughout the occupation, even as they sent their children and grandchildren away. They hunkered down with Iryna's disabled sister and their next-door neighbor, who suffered a broken arm when a missile hit her house.     ",
      "\"We were cooking food outdoors, in our yard, on the fire. I'm cooking and something is flying over my head and whistling. But come what may, we thought,\" Iryna said.     ",

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said he is suspending his country's participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States, imperiling the last remaining pact that regulates the world's two largest nuclear arsenals.  ",

      "Hours after Putin's speech, Russia's Foreign Ministry said the decision to suspend participation in the treaty was \"reversible.\"  ",
      "The treaty puts limits on the number of deployed intercontinental-range nuclear weapons that both the US and Russia can have. It was last extended in early 2021 for five years, meaning the two sides would soon need to begin negotiating on another arms control agreement.   ",
      "Under the key nuclear arms control treaty, both the United States and Russia are permitted to conduct inspections of each other's weapons sites, though inspections had been halted since 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  ",
      "While Russia is not withdrawing from the pact completely, it appears to be formalizing its current position. For months, US officials have been frustrated over Russia's lack of co-operation with the agreement.  ",
      "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Putin's decision \"deeply unfortunate and irresponsible.\"   ",
      "Blinken said President Joe Biden's administration remains ready to talk about the nuclear arms treaty \"at any time with Russia, irrespective of anything else going on in the world.\"  ",
      "He was joined by other Western allies, like France and the United Kingdom, which called on Putin to reverse the suspension. A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told CNN that Britain hopes Putin will \"reconsider his rash decision.\"   ",
      "In a lengthy statement published on its website, Russia's Foreign Ministry said the decision to suspend participation in the treaty is \"reversible,\" saying that \" Washington must show political will, make conscientious efforts for a general de-escalation and create conditions for the resumption of the full functioning of the Treaty and, accordingly, comprehensively ensuring its viability.\"   ",
      "The ministry urged \"the American side to do just that. Until then, any of our steps towards Washington in the context of START are absolutely out of the question.\"  ",
      "The ministry goes on to say that Moscow calls on the United States \"to refrain from steps that could prevent the resumption of the New START in the event that the necessary conditions for this mature.\"  ",
      "It also said that it would respect the nuclear weapons caps established under the treaty.  ",
      "According to US officials, Russia had already refused on numerous occasions to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities. \"Russia is not complying with its obligation under the New START Treaty to facilitate inspection activities on its territory,\" a US State Department spokesperson said in January.   ",
      "\"Russia's refusal to facilitate inspection activities prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of US-Russian nuclear arms control,\" the spokesperson said.  ",
      "A session of the Bilateral Consultative Commission on the treaty was slated to meet in Egypt in late November but was abruptly called off. The US has blamed Russia for this postponement, with a State Department spokesperson saying the decision was made \"unilaterally\" by Russia.  ",
      "The latest development announced by Putin \"puts (the) treaty on life support,\" Hans Kristensen, the Director of the Nuclear Information Project, wrote on Twitter, questioning whether Russia will now stop exchanging data with US counterparts.  ",

He didn't declare martial law or announce a new wave of military mobilization; he recycled the same lines about his rationale for invading Ukraine nearly one year ago; and he outlined no vision of how the war he launched might end.  ",
      "But Putin did offer at least one headline, announcing that Russia is suspending its participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty.   ",
      "\"The US and NATO openly state that their goal is the strategic defeat of Russia,\" he said. \"And what, after that are we just supposed to let them to travel around our (nuclear) facilities?\"  ",
      "Putin was referring to complaints by US officials that Russia was violating New START, the last remaining arms-control agreement governing the world's two largest nuclear arsenals, by refusing to allow US inspections of its nuclear facilities.  ",
      "\"They want to inflict a strategic defeat on us and climb all over our nuclear facilities,\" Putin said. \"So I'd like to make the announcement today that Russia is suspending its participation in the START Treaty.\"  ",
      "The Kremlin leader hastened to add that Russia is not withdrawing from the treaty entirely, only suspending participation. But he prefaced his remarks on arms-control with a lengthy tirade about the West's alleged aims in providing aid to Ukraine.  ",
      "\"I don't know how to call this other than a theater of the absurd,\" Putin said. \"We know that NATO is complicit in the attempts by the Kyiv regime to strike our air bases. And the drones used for this have been equipped and modernized by NATO specialists. And now they want to come and inspect our bases? Given the current confrontation, this just sounds like complete nonsense.\"  ",
      "Suspending the New START Treaty in some ways continues an uneasy status quo. Under the agreement, the US and Russia are permitted to conduct inspections of each other's weapons sites to verify compliance, but those inspections had been on hold since 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  ",
      "Putin's speech, then, was nothing new. In his rambling, one-hour-and-45-minute address, he offered some warmed-over options from a menu of complaints about the West and rehashed the same justifications for his full-scale war on Ukraine.   ",
      "His address, in fact, was reminiscent of the television speech that aired on February 24, 2022, announcing the start of the invasion of Ukraine, Russia's so-called \"special military operation.\" Putin repeated the same baseless claim that Moscow had no choice but to use force against Ukraine. And he doubled down on blaming the West for the conflict.  ",
      "\"I want to repeat: it was they who unleashed the war,\" Putin said. \"And we used and continue to use force to stop it.\"  ",
      "Such remarks seem intended for a domestic audience that in many ways has seen their sense of normalcy upended. So Putin also played the reassuring wartime leader, holding a moment of silence for soldiers killed in Ukraine, and promising that Russia will set up a special fund to offer assistance to families of veterans and soldiers killed in Ukraine and bolster social benefits for them.  ",
      "The Russian president also indirectly addressed some of the discontent in the ranks that has filtered back to the Kremlin following a partial mobilization last fall. Mobilization has been beset by morale-sapping logistical difficulties, supply problems and general disorganization, causing major outrage in Russian society. Putin pledged that rotations in Ukraine would be more predictable, and that soldiers would be given much-needed leave.   ",
      "\"Service in the zone of the special military operation - everyone understands this very well - is associated with colossal physical and psychological stress, with everyday risks to health and life,\" he said. \"Therefore, I consider it necessary to establish for the mobilized, in general for all military personnel, for all participants of the special military operation, including volunteers, regular leave lasting at least 14 days and at least once every six months, excluding travel time, so that each soldier has the opportunity to visit families, to be close to relatives and friends.\"  ",
      "That statement can be interpreted another way: Russians need to settle in for a long war, so soldiers should expect some R&R.  ",
      "The response to Putin's speech from many Ukrainians was, for those who could be even bothered to pay attention, utterly dismissive.   ",
      "Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the Head of the Presidential Office of Ukraine, suggested that Putin had lost the plot.   ",
      "\"Putin publicly demonstrated his irrelevance and confusion,\" he said on Twitter. \"Because everywhere there are 'Nazis, Martians and conspiracy theories.'\"  ",
      "That's a mocking appraisal, but in many ways an accurate one. The main takeaway for Russians from Putin's address was: You are surrounded by enemies, they started the war, and there is no light at the end of the \"special military operation\" tunnel.  "

      "The United Arab Emirates, for example, abstained from a symbolic a UN Security Council resolution condemning the war on February 27 of last year (Russia vetoed that resolution). Less than a week later, it voted in favor of a similar resolution at the General Assembly. UAE officials have said the war demonstrates that the world order is no longer unipolar with the US at its helm. The UAE has also become a safe haven for many Russian citizens and businesses since the war.   ",
      "Abu Dhabi, along with Saudi Arabia, also counts Russia as an ally in the OPEC+ oil cartel. That alliance allows member states to control the supply of oil, which in turn determines prices. The US warned Saudi Arabia last year that restricting the supply of oil would be tantamount to supporting Russia in the war. That warning fell on deaf ears.   ",
      "Iran, like Syria, is globally isolated and counts Russia as its main international ally. But the Islamic Republic, whose leaders regularly launch tirades against foreign intervention and imperialism, has abstained from such votes instead of vetoing them as Syria has. This is despite Tehran's role as a player in the war through its supply of killer drones to Russia.   ",
      "Israel, too, finds itself in a complicated situation. While it has publicly opposed the war, it has economic, cultural, political and security considerations in its dealings with Russia. What it cares most about with Russia is its influence on Iran and its presence in Syria. Israel regularly carries out airstrikes on Iranian targets in Syria, which it regards as critical to prevent the transfer of missile technology to Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group. It usually communicates with the Russians ahead of those strikes for deconfliction purposes.   ",

      "A new form of real estate is popping up along the beaches of South Africa and on the dry, barren islands off its coast - tiny white beach huts. With good ventilation and a sea view, they are just big enough to fit a family of African penguins. Their unique selling point: a safe and cool place for penguins to breed.   ",
      "African penguins, unlike their relatives that live in snow and ice, thrive in the cold currents of the South Atlantic Ocean. But when they come to land, their thick black coat absorbs the heat, and they desperately look for cover - both for themselves and their fragile eggs.   ",
      "Historically, the penguins dug burrows in layers of guano - accumulated seabird and bat feces - that lined Africa's penguin colonies, but in the 19th century, traders started selling guano as fertilizer, leaving the penguins and their eggs increasingly exposed to predators and the scorching sun.  ",
      "This, combined with other threats such as egg poaching, overfishing and climate change, has caused African penguin populations to plummet. In 2019, there were thought to be less than 20,000 breeding pairs, down from an estimated 1.5 to 3 million birds in 1900. For more than a decade, the species has been listed as endangered by the IUCN.   ",
      "That's why conservationists have come to the rescue with the African Penguin Nest Project - a coordinated effort between Dallas Zoo, AZA Safe, the Pan-African Association of Zoos and Aquaria, and the Dyer Island Conservation Trust - which aims to deploy artificial nests to give penguin parents a safe and shaded place to raise their chicks.  ",
      "While guano trade petered out by the late 1800s, replicating the layers that accumulated over thousands of years isn't an option. Seabird populations have declined so much over time, there are simply not enough birds to recreate it, says Kevin Graham, associate curator of birds and ectotherms at Dallas Zoo and coordinator of the African Penguin Nest Project. Some estimate it would take around 600 years to produce one usable guano layer, he adds.  ",
      "Instead, the project decided to build artificial nests. At first glance, they look fairly simple - a domed structure made from two molded shells of fabric coated in ceramic slurry, with a small entrance measuring about 20 centimeters wide. But the design took years to develop, as Graham and other scientists closely studied old guano nests and worked out how best to \"emulate Mother Nature.\"   ",
      "Getting the right temperature and humidity inside the nest was the hardest and most important part, says Graham. The two-layer design and ventilation holes create an air conditioning effect, while the white paint reflects the sun, helping to maintain an interior temperature of less than 35 degrees Celsius. \"Eggs are an extremely delicate structure; they're only set to be incubated at about 38 to 39 degrees. Any higher than that, there's a very real risk of the (unborn chicks in the) eggs dying,\" he explains.  ",
      "The project started to deploy the nests in late 2018. \"Within a matter of minutes, penguins were running into them,\" says Graham. \"That tells you how desperate they are for any opportunity to find a safe place to nest.\"  ",
      "Demand for the ceramic homes has been borne out in the data too - they have usage rates of at least 99%, according to Graham, and the rates for successful hatching and fledging chicks in artificial nests are much higher than those in natural ones elsewhere.   ",
      "More than 500 nests have been installed on Dyer Island, a bare and windswept isle off the coast of South Africa's Western Cape that was once home to some of the biggest colonies of African penguins.  ",
      "CapeNature, the governmental organization looking after the area, says it has already started to see the benefits.   ",
      "\"With the historic removal of guano, (the nests) are the next-best option to giving penguins that opportunity and ensuring the survival of those chicks and the fledglings,\" says Andrae Marais, CapeNature's conservation manager for the island. He adds that while it's a step in the right direction, it must be combined with other conservation efforts, such as implementing no fishing zones around the colonies to ensure food security for the birds.   ",
      "Graham agrees that population recovery depends on more than just giving African penguins a safe place to breed. It's not simply a case of \"we give them a nest, the species is saved,\" he says. \"It's a big part of it, but there has to be more.\"  ",
      "Related: Stunning images from African Wildlife Foundation's photography award are inspiring conservation",
      "The project relies on donations, with individuals or groups able to sponsor individual nests. Each one costs around $75 to build and is expected to last 15 years or more, so Graham expects a single nest to accommodate around 30 nesting events, and potentially up to 60 chicks.  ",
      "Related: Desert elephants are finding friends in the drylands of Namibia",
      "To date, the African Penguin Nest Project has installed more than 1,500 nests across five of South Africa's penguin colonies, and plans to expand into Namibia next year, the only other country with breeding populations of the species.   ",
      "\"This is still just a drop in the bucket,\" says Graham, who anticipates they will need to deploy at least 4,500 more ceramic homes to protect penguins currently nesting in exposed areas. \"The goal is that every penguin that needs a nest will get one.\"   "

      "Mikhail says many of the men had protested the war and some had been arrested for demonstrating. And they all had one thing in common: They were against the Russian war with Ukraine.   ",

      "North Korea is a \"clear and present danger,\" the foreign minister of South Korea has told CNN in an exclusive interview.  ",
      "Kim Jong Un's frequent missile tests and repeated warnings that he would consider using tactical nuclear weapons were a display of aggression and the only way to counter this was through extended US deterrence, Foreign Minister Park Jin said on Wednesday.  ",
      "\"What North Korea is doing is completely wrong,\" Park said. \"They have been escalating nuclear and missile threats, and threatening the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia.\"  ",
      "In just the past week, North Korea has tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, which in theory could be used to strike almost anywhere in the world, and nuclear-capable long-range multiple rocket launchers - the equivalent of short-range ballistic missiles - which could hit anywhere in South Korea. Those followed a record year of missile testing in 2022, when Pyongyang tested missiles on 37 days, according to CNN's count, all in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions.  ",
      "After the rocket launches on Monday, Kim Yo Jong, Kim Jong Un's sister, warned of more missile tests to come unless the United States halts military drills with South Korea, threatening to make the Pacific Ocean \"our shooting range.\"  ",
      "But Park suggested such belligerence would only strengthen South Korea's alliance with the US.  ",
      "\"US extended deterrence\" is \"the only way that we can effectively protect our country from the North Korean aggression,\" Park said, adding that enhancing that deterrence would involve \"effective deployment of US strategic assets\" as well as exercises and training.  ",
      "On the same day as Park was speaking, guided-missile destroyers from both countries were joined by another from Japan in a ballistic missile defense exercise in the waters between Japan and the Korean Peninsula.  ",
      "Park offered little hope for any early easing of tensions with North Korea, saying there are no active negotiations and that Kim would not give up his nuclear weapons voluntarily.  ",
      "The North Korean leader must be made to see that talks are his only option, Park said.  ",
      "\"We have to create an environment where North Korea has no choice but to come back to the negotiation table,\" he said.  ",
      "Experience had shown that Kim would not negotiate when he sensed weakness in his opponents, Park said, citing failed negotiations that occurred during the administration of former US President Donald Trump.  ",
      "\"The lesson we learned is that when we are strong ... North Korea comes to the dialogue table. When we are weak, they try to take advantage of that vulnerability. So we have to prepare ourselves through our defense and also through deterrence to talk with the North,\" he said.  ",
      "Park also said South Korea's security challenges extend beyond the Korean Peninsula, including a thousand miles to the south across the Taiwan Strait.  ",
      "\"Peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is essential for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, and it's indispensable for security and prosperity of the region as a whole,\" Park said.  ",
      "China's ruling Communist Party has for months been pressuring the self-ruled island of Taiwan. It sees the island as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has repeatedly refused to rule out the use of force in \"reunifying\" it with the Chinese mainland.  ",
      "Park said that could have a \"direct impact\" on South Korea.  ",
      "\"We are opposed to unilateral change of (the) status quo by force. So in that sense, we will make sure that if something happens in the Taiwan Strait, we have to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\" he said.  "

      "But Canadian star Eugene Levy freely admits that he's \"not fond of traveling\" at all, describing himself as more of \"the great indoors type of guy.\"  ",
      "\"I don't hate it. [Hate] is a very strong word,\" Levy tells CNN Travel. \"But I don't really love it.\"  ",
      "The Emmy winner is continually forced out of his comfort zone in his latest TV project \"The Reluctant Traveler,\" an eight-episode Apple TV+ travel series that follows Levy as he hesitantly travels to places like Finland, Costa Rica, South Africa and Tokyo.  ",
      "Famous for his deadpan delivery, Levy makes no attempt to even pretend that he's getting any enjoyment out of many of the experiences, which involve going dog-sledding, visiting the rainforest and even taking a stool sample from an elephant.   ",
      "He describes a night hike through the Costa Rican rainforest as one of the \"least pleasant\" moments captured for the cameras, explaining that \"the creepy crawly aspect\" was particularly off putting.  ",
      "\"I would never have done that [a night hike through the rainforest] in a million years,\" he says. \"But I'm doing this to be able to try things I wouldn't have tried and form an opinion. And I did form an opinion and you know what: didn't like it. Wouldn't do it again.\"  ",
      "So how did someone who says they'd \"rather stay at home\" than go on any sort of wild travel adventure end up fronting a travel show?   ",
      "According to Levy, the idea came about when he was approached to appear in a more typical travel series and decided to explain to producers exactly why he was the absolute worst person for the job.  ",
      "\"They said, 'That's it. That's the show,'\" he explains, before stressing that he's aware that being able to go to places that many people could only dream of is \"kind of a great job,\" and he feels lucky to have been able to do it.  ",
      "\"Eight billion people would kill to be doing this,\" he says. \"But there's an honesty about being able to say, 'I truly didn't enjoy that.'  ",
      "\"Where most people, I think, wouldn't say that, because they feel it's not necessarily a very positive thing to say.\"  ",
      "He hopes that \"The Reluctant Traveler\" will appeal to people like him as well as \"more seasoned travelers.\"  ",
      "\"I think there's a lot of people out there who will look at me up there and just kind of see me as a kindred spirit,\" he says.  ",
      "However, Levy admits that he enjoyed visiting Finland far more than he expected to, and found the outdoor activities, particularly driving a dog sled team across a frozen lake, as \"exhilarating.\"  ",
      "\"It was a lot of fun,\" he says. \"I did love that. Ice fishing: didn't care for it. Wouldn't want to do it again.\"  ",
      "While he also had a great time in both Lisbon and the Maldives, Levy doubts that he'll ever be prepared to do the 20-hour or so flight from Los Angeles in order to visit the latter again.    ",
      "Levy, who played Noah Levenstein, Jim Levenstein's dad, in \"American Pie,\" was accompanied by his actress daughter Sarah Levy while filming some of the episodes of the show, which premieres on February 24, while his wife Deborah Divine also came out to join him.   ",
      "He explains that Divine, as well as Sarah and his son Dan Levy, who both starred alongside him in \"Schitt's Creek,\" love to \"get out and see new things and try new things\" while he \"kind of lags behind a bit.\"  ",
      "\"I wish I could be setting a better example,\" he admits. \"But hey, that's dad.\"  ",
      "According to Levy, \"laying out on a beach chair\" in the French Riviera or Hawaii while sipping on a cool drink is \"more up my alley.\"  ",
      "\"You don't have to be moving, moving, moving, seeing something, traveling here, making sure you see this,\" he explains.  ",
      "\"Gotta get there now, because it closes at 5 p.m. There's a lot of running around that I don't enjoy [about traveling] but put me in a lovely beach chair with nothing to do but just chill. That's not a bad trip.\"  ",
      "Levy is particularly fond of Italy, declaring that \"you can't get a bad meal\" there, as well as New York, where he also enjoys the culinary delights, as well as \"just walking around.\"  ",
      "\"[I] don't need a list of a dozen things that I have to do here,\" he adds.  ",
      "So has visiting a number of places he had no interest in going to, and trying things he \"would never remotely have considered doing,\" made Levy a less reluctant traveler?  ",
      "The short answer to that would be \"no.\" But he notes that he's \"opening up to the idea that you might have to force yourself to get out and go to some of these places that you might not have gone to.\"   ",
      "\"I think at the core, between people who love traveling and exploring and absolutely can't wait to get out and explore new countries, new terrains and new cultures and whatever it is. They get excited about it,\" he adds.   ",
      "\"And I don't. That's just the difference. It's not so much that you hate to do something. It's just the question of, 'where's the enjoyment factor?'\"  ",
      "And although Levy stresses that there's little chance of him deciding to go hiking in the Himalayas any time soon, he believes that he's becoming a more enlightened person by taking on different experiences, however reluctantly that may be.  ",
      "\"If you were to ask me, 'what's the one place in the world you want to get to?' I would say, 'I don't have that location.'  ",

      "It was \"Rail Force One\" - the overnight train that took US President Biden on a diplomatic odyssey from Przemy\u015bl G\u0142\u00f3wny in Poland to Kyiv for his historic visit to Ukraine, just before the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of the country.  ",
      "The 10-hour overnight journey was a top secret, high security challenge for Ukrzaliznytsia, or Ukrainian Railways - the state-owned operator of Ukraine's rail network. But it was hardly their first.   ",
      "With commercial air links into Ukraine canceled, and the skies too dangerous to fly politicians in and out of the country, Ukraine's rail network has become the country's diplomatic highway. Over 200 foreign diplomatic missions have arrived in the country by train so far.   ",
      "World leaders including Canada's Justin Trudeau, the UK's Rishi Sunak, France's Emmanuel Macron and Italy's Giorgia Meloni have all taken the train to Kyiv. In fact, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is the only G7 leader yet to visit the country by train.   ",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is a regular user of the railway network on his diplomatic missions abroad.   ",
      "But there's more to the railways than \"Rail Force One,\" as Biden's train was dubbed.   ",
      "The US president's high profile journey has shone a spotlight on Ukraine's vast rail network which, at nearly 15,000 miles, is the 12th largest in the world.   ",
      "Ukrzaliznytsia is the sixth largest rail passenger transporter in the world, and seventh for freight.  ",
      "First constructed in pre-Soviet times, its network is predominantly a broad gauge railway - different to the standard gauge, which most of Europe uses.   ",
      "And while Ukraine forces have destroyed the cross-border links to Russia, the rail network still connects with other countries - although the differing gauges mean trains can't generally cross the border. To deal with this, over the past year they have rebuilt sections of previously defunct lines to neighboring countries including Moldova, Poland and Romania. Infrastructure has been repaired at 11 border crossings.  ",
      "This isn't just about making passenger journeys easier. It's crucial for freight - and for much of the world, which relies on Ukrainian produce, including grain. In 2022, 28.9 million tons of grain were transported via the railways, most of which was exported. In total, just under 60 million tons of goods were exported from Ukraine, according to Ukrzaliznytsia.  ",
      "And in total, the company transported 17.1 million passengers via long-distance trains during 2022. These are predominantly sleeper services.  ",
      "\"Before the war, we had planes, cars, buses and trains,\" Ukrzaliznytsia's CEO Alexander Kamyshin told CNN Travel. \"Now we've got trains and cars, no airplanes. And we're a large country. So to get from Kyiv to west, south or east Ukraine, sleeper trains are the best way to do it. You go to the train in the late evening, travel the whole night, and in the morning you are in the city you need to be. So you don't waste time.  ",
      "\"It was comfortable before the war, and now it's comfortable and safe. Trains are very important.\"  ",
      "Of course, most of the pictures we have seen in the past year of Ukrainian Railways are ones of refugees. Ukrzaliznytsia says it helped four million to safety in 2022, a quarter of whom were children.  ",
      "Some trains were also reconfigured as medical facilities. Around 2,500 civilians were evacuated for medical treatment via rail last year. The network also transported nearly 336,000 tons of humanitarian aid.   ",
      "It's an immense responsibility for Kamyshin, who started with the company just six months before Russia invaded. \"I joined with the problem to develop the company, green-light new projects, renew the fleet and it was all about building and construction, and procuring new stuff. But a year ago we had to change to war time, and war rails,\" he says.   ",
      "Perhaps the most extraordinary part of Biden's journey to Ukraine was the light that it shed on just how smoothly Ukrzaliznytsia operates.  ",
      "Kamyshin apologized in a tweet that, because of Biden's complex journey, \"only 90% of our trains ran on time yesterday.\"  ",
      "That caused hollow laughter in Biden's America, where Amtrak is infamous for its late-running passenger trains.   ",
      "Amtrak's latest on-time performance figures, looking at June 2022, show that on average, just over 22% of trains ran on time across the US. Some areas have reversed Ukraine's statistics, with more than 90% of trains arriving late.   ",
      "In the UK - which has sent two prime ministers to Ukraine by train - just 67.7% of trains run on time, according to the latest data.  ",
      "That's no surprise to Ukrainians. The train services have always been excellent, says Kyiv resident Alla Penalba.  ",
      "\"I've always taken the train when traveling around Ukraine,\" she says. She's a particular fan of sleeper services. \"It's convenient - you board in the evening and in the morning you're on the opposite of the country. Even before 2014 [when Russia invaded Crimea] the journey to Crimea from Kyiv was more convenient by train. It took 20 hours, but you sat down, then went to sleep - it was pretty comfy.\"  ",
      "Penalba says that because low-cost airlines entered Ukraine later than in the rest of Europe, the country retained its network of night trains, with limited domestic flights.  ",
      "Even when the budget airlines did arrive - she reckons that from 2016 there were more viable options to fly cross-country - she didn't bite.   ",
      "\"I could fly to Odesa from Kyiv but still I'd think, OK, I need to go to the airport two hours in advance, if you live on the opposite side of Kyiv it can take an hour to get there - so that's three hours plus the flight. Ultimately it's more convenient to take the train at 11 p.m., sleep, and arrive at 7 a.m.\"  ",
      "Penalba left Kyiv with her family on the second day of the 2022 invasion, driving to France, where her husband is from. But she returned alone in the summer to take care of personal business, and to see if it felt safe to move back.  ",
      "On her way into Ukraine, she took a flight to Poland and then a bus to Kyiv: \"A terrible experience, I hate long bus journeys.\"  ",
      "On the way back, she took the overnight train to Poland: \"It was the best experience out of two days of travel.\"   ",
      "When the family moved back to Kyiv, in August 2022, they again took the train from Poland, getting a second class, four-berth compartment for her, her husband and their two kids. Their only stress? The Polish train was delayed by three hours. Unlike the Ukrainian one.  ",
      "\"I was amazed and pretty proud,\" says Penalba.  ",
      "Visitors to the country are equally amazed - starting with Penalba's husband, who moved from France in 2015.  ",
      "\"He's always saying that Ukrainian trains are pretty great compared to the ones in France,\" she says. \"He didn't use trains there because they were too expensive. Here they are accessible for everyone.\"  ",
      "A cross-border train to Poland costs around 50 euros (about $53) for a lie-flat bed in a four-person, second class berth, and Penalba says that domestic routes are even cheaper - around 15-30 euros. \"First class would be around 40 euros,\" she says.   ",
      "Koen Berghuis, editor-in-chief of train specialist travel website, Paliparan, is another fan. Based in Romania, the Dutch national takes around half a dozen long distance or overnight trains per month, and before the war, traveled to Ukraine over 10 times.  ",
      "For him, if you're comparing punctuality, Ukraine's railway system is \"better than Germany's.\"   ",
      "\"They're doing a remarkable job - even now, trains are running more or less on time,\" he says.  ",
      "Astonishingly, Penalba reckons the system has got \"more efficient\" since the Russian invasion.  ",
      "In August 2022, Ukrzaliznytsia launched an app, and started taking online bookings. \"I can buy tickets in a few clicks now,\" she says.  ",
      "Kamyshin says that the only real change to the service in the past year is that trains run at slightly reduced speeds now. \"It's not much slower, but we slowed them down deliberately to make it safer in case of something [happening].\"  ",
      "Of course, politicians don't travel in third class. Kamyshin won't reveal details of the service they do get, but he says that \"guests of iron diplomacy,\" as he calls them, \"usually spend more time on the train than in the city.\"  ",
      "\"That's why the way we treat them is really important, he says.\"  ",
      "But it's not just about treating them right. The trains also convey \"the messages that we would like to send them,\" he says.   ",
      "\"We are delicate and we'll always treat all of our guests properly, but these things help them understand what we expect from them - like iris flowers or leopard print clothes.\"   ",
      "A vase of irises was put in the train for the visit of German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose country agreed to supply an air defense system called Iris-T. For another politician, staff wore leopard print accessories, in a nod to the Leopard-2 tanks Ukraine was requesting from the country in question. Kamyshin won't say who that was, but Poland and Germany have also donated Leopard-2 tanks, with Germany pledging more on the first anniversary of the invasion.  ",
      "Rail travel in Europe has always been popular, of course, and the climate crisis is making it increasingly so. Berghuis thinks that Ukraine can teach other rail networks a thing or two.  ",
      "\"The main difference to other European countries is the sheer scale of Ukraine as a country,\" he says.  ",
      "At the start of last year, he took the Rakhiv-Mariupol sleeper train - Ukraine's longest passenger train route before Russia's invasion. At 1,806 kilometers, or 1,118 miles, it took just under 29 hours, crossing 12 \"oblasts\" (regions).  ",
      "\"It was basically the same as Amsterdam to Lisbon or Athens, or New York to Kansas City,\" he says. Except passengers on those type of routes would, of course, usually fly.  ",
      "Ukraine's size means that its \"huge\" rail network has \"always been a lifeline to Ukrainians - it's a very important piece of infrastructure,\" he says.  ",
      "That's why the Ukrainians are leaping into action if any of the line is damaged during the fighting. When the southern city of Kherson was liberated, the trains were running into the city again just eight days later.  ",
      "\"It's incredible,\" says Berghuis.   ",
      "\"It's hugely important for them, for keeping the country united, ensuring people can visit families and friends, for freight and for the postal network. They use trains to deliver some pensions.   ",
      "\"It's also for PR, because everything is PR in a war - they're showing Russia, 'Hey, even in these circumstances we manage to run trains. Even if there's no electricity, it doesn't matter, we can use diesel or steam locomotives.' But the rail network is also a lifeline in many more ways than we can imagine.\"  ",
      "And while Europe is going through a sleeper train \"renaissance\" at the moment, Berghuis says that Ukraine is a great example of how to run a night train network.  ",
      "There are generally three classes to a sleeper, he says, with each carriage having its own attendant. They're there to give passengers their bedding, take orders for snacks and tea, and make sure passengers get on and off at the right stations. But they're also there for security - especially important when you're sleeping in an open cabin of 50-odd berths.  ",
      "Yes, 50-odd - that's what you get in the third class carriages, which are essentially wagons of bunkbeds which double as seats during the daytime part of the trip.   ",
      "\"The attendants keep an eye out for everyone in their wagon - they're proud of what they do,\" says Berghuis. Not that they really need to. He says that third class carriages are \"part of the fun, with people happy to share their food, stories, try and talk - even if it's with hand gestures.\"  ",
      "Second class gets you a space in a four-berth couchette, while first class is fancier.   ",
      "The stations are also worth visiting, says Berghuis, who singles out Kyiv and Lviv as two of the most beautiful historical stations in Europe, and loves Odesa for its \"seaside, holiday vibe.\"   ",
      "So what's the future for Ukrainian Railways? This is a company that hasn't just kept going during the invasion - it has made improvements, too.   ",
      "In 2022, the country took possession of 65 new passenger rail carriages, bought two new diesel trains, and even found time to refurbish other trains in the network. They constructed new freight cars, and repaired others.  ",
      "They launched six new international rail routes, to destinations in Poland and Moldova, and seven domestic routes. The company also electrified more track than they had done in the past decade.  ",
      "The company even debuted a new onboard menu. Passengers can now enjoy \"designer teas\" and \"natural ground coffee.\"  ",
      "Tragically, 319 railway workers died in 2022, and 703 were injured. The company has launched an \"Iron Family\" program to support their families.  ",
      "For 2023, the company predicts a loss of 20.2 billion hryvnia - or $549 million. Yet it is looking to the future. In May 2022, \"Children's Railways\" - where kids can learn about locomotives - opened in Kyiv and Rivne. Around 1,300 children are already studying at the two centers.   ",
      "With the climate crisis intensifying, Kamyshin thinks Ukrainian Railways can teach other countries' rail networks a few things. \"The whole world should pay more attention to overnight sleepers,\" he says.   ",
      "\"It's a really efficient, comfortable way of transportation. And governments should review their relationships to railways. Railways are important, especially in a big crisis.\"  ",
      "In fact, Penalba said she was \"shocked\" to see people flying than taking the train when she first started traveling around the rest of Europe.  ",
      "\"There's a lot of talk around ecology, but planes are cheaper and night trains are especially expensive, so it's cheaper to fly,\" she says.   ",
      "\"I'm used to [shorthaul European flights] now, but it's still shocking. It'd be much more convenient if trains in the rest of Europe were as affordable and easy as in Ukraine.\"   "

      "The reliability of our faucets providing water every time we turn them on can make water seem like a magical, never-ending resource.   ",
      "But abusing the availability of this finite resource can contribute to water scarcity and harm our capacity to deal with the impact of the climate crisis.    ",
      "\"Four billion people today already live in places that are affected by water scarcity at least part of the year,\" said Rick Hogeboom, executive director of the Water Footprint Network, an international knowledge center based in the Netherlands. \"Climate change will have a worsening influence on the demand-supply balance,\" he said.  ",
      "\"If all people were to conserve water in some way, that would help ease some of the immediate impacts seen from the climate crisis,\" said Shanika Whitehurst, associate director of sustainability for Consumer Reports' research and testing. Consumer Reports is a nonprofit that helps consumers evaluate goods and services.  ",
      "\"Unfortunately, there has been a great toll taken on our surface and groundwater sources, so conservation efforts would more than likely have to be employed long term for there to be a more substantial effect.\"   ",
      "Yes, businesses and governments should play a part in water conservation by, respectively, producing goods \"water efficiently\" and allocating water in a sustainable, equitable way, Hogeboom said.   ",
      "But \"addressing the multifaceted water crises is a shared responsibility. No one actor can solve it, nor is there a silver bullet,\" he added. \"We need all actors to play their part.\"   ",
      "Contrary to what you might think, the water used directly in and around the home makes up a minor portion of the total water footprint of a consumer, Hogeboom said.   ",
      "\"The bulk - typically at least 95% - is indirect water use, water use that is hidden in the products we buy, the clothes we wear and the food we eat,\" Hogeboom said. \"Cotton, for instance, is a very thirsty crop.\"    ",
      "Of the 300-plus gallons of water the average American family uses every day at home, however, roughly 70% of this use occurs indoors, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency - making the home another important place to start cutting your use.   ",
      "Here are some ways to reduce your water footprint as you move from room to room and outdoors.   ",
      "Since the kitchen involves dishwashing, cooking and one of the biggest water guzzlers - your diet - it's a good place to start.   ",
      "An old kitchen faucet can release 1 to 3 gallons of water per minute when running at full blast, according to Consumer Reports. Instead of rinsing dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, scrape food into your trash or compost bin. Make sure your dishwasher is fully loaded so you only do as many wash cycles as necessary and make the most use of the water.   ",
      "With some activities you can save water by not only using less but also upgrading the appliances that deliver the water. Dishwashers certified by Energy Star, the government-backed symbol for energy efficiency, are about 15% more water-efficient than standard models, according to Consumer Reports.   ",
      "If you do wash dishes by hand, plug up the sink or use a wash basin so you can use a limited amount of water instead of letting the tap run.   ",
      "If you plan on eating frozen foods, thaw them in the fridge overnight instead of running water over them. For drinking, keep a pitcher of water in the fridge instead of running the faucet until the water's cool - and if you need to do that to get hot water, collect the cold water and use it to water plants.   ",
      "Cook foods in as little water as possible, which can also retain flavor, according to the University of Toronto Scarborough's department of physical and environmental sciences.   ",
      "When it comes to saving water via what you eat, generally animal products are more water-intensive than plant-based alternatives, Hogeboom said.   ",
      "\"Go vegetarian or even better vegan,\" he added. \"If you insist on meat, replace red meat by pig or chicken, which has a lower water footprint than beef.\"   ",
      "It takes more than 1,800 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of beef, Consumer Reports' Whitehurst said.   ",
      "The bathroom is the largest consumer of indoor water, as the toilet alone can use 27% of household water, according to the EPA. You can cut use here by following this adage: \"If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down.\"   ",
      "\"Limiting the amount of toilet flushes - as long as it is urine - is not problematic for hygiene,\" Whitehurst said. \"However, you do have to watch the amount of toilet paper to avoid clogging your pipes. If there is solid waste or feces, then flush the toilet immediately to avoid unsanitary conditions.\"    ",
      "Older toilets use between 3.5 and 7 gallons of water per flush, but WaterSense-labeled toilets use up to 60% less. WaterSense is a partnership program sponsored by the EPA.   ",
      "\"There's probably more to gain by having dual flush systems so you don't waste gallons for small flushes,\" Hogeboom said.   ",
      "By turning off the sink tap when you brush your teeth, shave or wash your face, you can save more than 200 gallons of water monthly, according to the EPA.   ",
      "Cut water use further by limiting showers to five minutes and eliminating baths. Shower with your partner when you can. Save even more water by turning it off when you're shampooing, shaving or lathering up, Consumer Reports suggests.   ",
      "Replacing old sink faucets or showerheads with WaterSense models can save hundreds of gallons of water per year.   ",
      "Laundry rooms account for nearly a fourth of household water use, according to the EPA. Traditional washing machines can use 50 gallons of water or more per load, but newer energy- and water-conserving machines use less than 27 gallons per load.   ",
      "You can also cut back by doing full loads (but not overstuffing) and choosing the appropriate water level and soil settings. Doing the latter two can help high-efficiency machines use only the water that's needed. If you have a high-efficiency machine, use HE detergent or measure out regular detergent, which is more sudsy and, if too much is used, can cause the machine to use more water, according to Consumer Reports.   ",
      "Nationally, outdoor water use accounts for 30% of household use, according to the EPA. This percentage can be much higher in drier parts of the country and in more water-intensive landscapes, particularly in the West.  ",
      "If you prefer to have a landscape, reduce your outdoor use by planting only plants appropriate for your climate or ones that are low-water and drought-resistant.   ",
      "\"If maintained properly, climate-appropriate landscaping can use less than one-half the water of a traditional landscape,\" the EPA says.   ",
      "The biggest water consumers outside are automatic irrigation systems, according to the EPA. To use only what's necessary, adjust irrigation controllers at least once per month to account for weather changes. WaterSense irrigation controllers monitor weather and landscape conditions to water plants only when needed.   "

      "A winter heatwave, record low levels of rain and a startling lack of snow in Europe are pushing rivers, canals and lakes across the continent to alarmingly low levels, with experts warning there could be repeat of last year's severe droughts.  ",
      "Images of dried-up river beds and shrunken lakes are usually associated with the scorching heat of summer - not the winter. But an exceptionally warm and dry start to the year is affecting a swath of Europe, including central and southwest France, northern Spain and northern Italy.   ",
      "There are concerns for what this might mean for water supplies.   ",
      "Europe's water situation has become \"very precarious,\" according to a study published in January by researchers at the Graz University of Technology in Austria, which used satellite data to analyze the world's groundwater resources.  ",
      "\"A few years ago, I would never have imagined that water would be a problem here in Europe,\" said Torsten Mayer-G\u00fcrr, one of the researchers. \"We are actually getting problems with the water supply here - we have to think about this.\"  ",
      "France, which is experiencing its driest stretch in more than 60 years, may soon bring in water restrictions.   ",
      "The country \"suffered a series of 32 consecutive days without any significant rainfall from January 21 to February 21,\" Simon Mittelberger, a climatologist at M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, told CNN - the longest stretch since records began in 1959.  ",
      "It is having  a damaging effect on the country's rivers and lakes, Mittelberger said, as well as the country's soils.  ",
      "\"Soils are much drier than usual,\" he said. France's current soil moisture levels would not normally be seen until mid-April.  ",
      "Snowfall has also been low. \"The situation in the Pyrenees is close to the lowest record of snow quantity for that time of year,\" Mittelberger said. The Alps have seen 63% less snow than usual, according to CIMA Research Foundation.  ",
      "A lack of snow in the winter can threaten water reserves in the spring and summer, as there is less snowmelt to sustain rivers.  ",
      "Last summer, France suffered its worst drought on record but, Mittelberger warned, this year \"the situation could be worse if we don't have significant rainfall in the next couple of months.\"  ",
      "Christophe B\u00e9chu, the minister for ecological transition, called the winter drought \"unprecedented,\" and warned the country is in a state of alert.   ",
      "In Italy, some of country's most famous bodies of water are drying up.  ",
      "Water levels at Lake Garda are so low that it is now possible to walk to an island in the middle, along a strip of exposed lake bed. A few months ago, this walkway did not exist.  ",
      "It is now also a lot harder to take a water taxi in Venice, as some of its canals have become too shallow to keep gondolas afloat, in part, because of a lack of rainfall.   ",
      "The city which has long feared flooding is now grappling with the opposite problem.   ",
      "Italy's longest river, the Po, which winds through its northern agricultural heartland, has 61% less water than usual for this time of year.  ",
      "Last summer, the Italian government declared a state of emergency for the area surrounding the Po, which experienced its worst drought in 70 years.  ",
      "Giorgio Zampetti, general manager of Legambiente, an Italian environmental group, fears that the worst is yet to come: \"2023 has just begun, but it is showing worrying signs in terms of extreme weather events [and] drought levels,\" he said in a press statement.  ",
      "In Spain, which experienced its hottest year on record last year, there are concerns about water supplies.   ",
      "\"We cannot guarantee water supply for drinking water or for economic uses by relying exclusively on rain,\" Teresa Ribera, Minister for the Ecological Transition recently said at a press conference.   ",
      "The country has approved plans to invest around $24 billion in water management, including measures to improve sanitation and treatment and modernize irrigation.  ",
      "Since 1980 the average available water has decreased by 12%, with projections that there may be a further decrease of up to 40% by 2050.  ",
      "Dry weather in Spain is also threatening the country's prized jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico bellota, as low rainfall and rising temperatures affect the acorns eaten by the pigs.  ",
      "While Europe has previously been blighted by summer droughts, experts fear the exceptionally dry last two months may signal a new reality, caused in part by rising average global temperatures.  ",
      "\"These conditions were rare in the past, but climate change is altering precipitation regimes over Europe and making these extremes more recurrent and intense,\" Andrea Toreti, a climatologist at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, told CNN.  ",
      "\"There is a growing concern due to the lack of precipitation in the last weeks and also considering the 2022 drought. The coming weeks will be crucial,\" Torerti said.  ",

      "The Kings narrowly edged past the Clippers 176-175 in double overtime at Crypto.com Arena thanks to a go-ahead bucket from point guard De'Aaron Fox in the final seconds.   ",
      "It capped off a wild evening of scoring in California, with the two teams exchanging buckets throughout with little to separate them.   ",
      "For just the second time in the NBA's history, both teams scored over 170 points and the 351 combined points puts it second behind the Detroit Pistons and Denver Nuggets' 186-184 triple overtime game on December 13, 1983, which holds the record for the most points scored.  ",
      "Clippers coach Tyronn Lue called it a \"crazy game\" with \"a lot of momentum shifts,\" while Kings coach Mike Brown said the spectators in attendance will have gone home happy.   ",
      "\"From a fan's standpoint, I can see how this game would have been a lot of fun to watch,\" Brown said. \"There was unbelievable shot making and great defense. There was high-level talent that was on display. Kudos to the players.\"  ",
      "It looked as if the new-look Clippers would have been able to wrap up a high-scoring evening in regulation time on Friday, holding a 145-131 lead with just 4:25 left in the fourth quarter.   ",
      "But a 22-8 run from the Kings - including 10 straight points - forced overtime, with a three-pointer from Malik Monk with just 1.1 seconds remaining leveling the scores.   ",
      "And yet again in overtime, the Clippers had a slender lead but could not hold on as Sacramento once again came racing back, with Fox's bucket with 36.5 seconds remaining the final score.   ",
      "The Clippers had one final opportunity to snatch a win but Nicolas Batum's three-pointer at the buzzer was off.   ",
      "Monk top-scored in the game with a career-high 45 points, made even more remarkable as he started on the bench, while Fox added his own 42 points along with 12 assists.   ",
      "Kawhi Leonard and Paul George led the resistance for Los Angeles, with the pair scoring 44 and 34 points respectively.   ",
      "Friday's game also marked the Clippers debut of Russell Westbrook, who signed with the team on Wednesday two days after he was waived by the Utah Jazz.   ",
      "The nine-time All-Star was traded from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Jazz as part of a three-team deal on February 10 following a turbulent 18 months with his hometown team.   ",
      "And Westbrook - who became just the second players ever to start a game for both the Clippers and the Lakers in the same season since the Clippers moved to LA in 1984-85 - had 17 points, 14 assists and five rebounds to go with seven turnovers.   "

      "She's been waiting for this day for decades.   ",
      "At any moment the woman she tried to find for so long will finally be here.   ",
      "It's been more than 23 years since a stranger on an airplane gave Zugay and her sister an envelope with $100 in it that would change their lives.   ",
      "A CNN story last spring featured Zugay's quest to find the woman and thank her. At the time, Zugay only knew that the woman's first name was Tracy, that she played tennis and that her act of generosity had made a tremendous difference in the lives of two refugees from the former Yugoslavia who were just beginning a new life in the United States.  ",
      "The story reached millions of readers - many of whom sent in tips to help with the search. Several of them saw the handwriting on the envelope and knew right away who was behind it: Tracy Peck of Blaine, Minnesota.  ",
      "Zugay and her older sister, Vanja Contino, reconnected with Peck in an emotional Zoom call that weekend.   ",
      "But they haven't had a chance to meet in person - until now, when an invitation to appear as special guests on \"CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute\" has brought all three women to New York City.  ",
      "It's a joyful occasion. But as they wait for Peck to arrive, Zugay tells her sister that she's feeling anxious and emotional.  ",
      "What if the moment doesn't feel right? What if they struggle to connect with each other? What if the woman who's inspired her for so many years ends up seeing her as a disappointment?  ",
      "Tears well up in her eyes.  ",
      "\"I don't want to let her down,\" she says.  ",
      "Contino tells her sister that could never happen.  ",
      "\"You are an amazing person,\" she says. \"This is all happening because of you.\"  ",
      "Zugay and Contino hide themselves behind a Christmas tree covered with gleaming gold ornaments, hoping to surprise Peck when she arrives.  ",
      "As they wait, the Midtown Manhattan hotel lobby where they've planned to meet is bustling. Guests toting suitcases and shopping bags dart past them, oblivious to the dramatic moment that's about to unfold.   ",
      "Even though they know she's coming, Peck catches them by surprise when she finally appears.  ",
      "\"Hi!\" the sisters shout in unison, rushing forward to wrap their arms around Peck.  ",
      "\"My lovelies!\" Peck exclaims.   ",
      "Her face reddens as tears stream down her cheeks. \"Oh! This is such a blessing,\" she says, and they hold each other tighter.  ",
      "To Peck, the hug feels like an embrace from family members she's known for years.   ",
      "To Contino, it's an amazing connection between the past and the present that she never imagined would be possible.  ",
      "To Zugay, it feels like a moment of closure, and a moment of something new that's just beginning.   ",
      "A few minutes later, Zugay and Peck settle down on the couch in Zugay's hotel room. Contino sits on a chair nearby, snapping photos and taking in the scene.  ",
      "They've exchanged some texts and messages on social media since their virtual meetup in the spring. When she got engaged several months ago, Zugay texted Peck to tell her.   ",
      "But there's so much more to catch up on, and so much to share.   ",
      "The last time these three women sat side by side, they were in very different places, even though they were flying to the same destination.  ",
      "On May 31, 1999, Peck was in her late 40s and had just finished a dream vacation watching the French Open with friends.  ",
      "Contino, then 17, and Zugay, then nearly 12, had just said goodbye to their parents and everything they knew as they fled their war-torn country.  ",
      "Peck was heading home to be with her family. Zugay and Contino were heading into uncertainty. They were seeking refuge in the United States, but had no idea what they'd find once they arrived.  ",
      "Zugay didn't speak much English then, but she sensed the compassion in her seatmate's voice.  ",
      "\"We were able to communicate even though we had so many differences,\" she says.  ",
      "After hearing the sisters' story that day, Peck handed them an envelope at the end of the flight, telling them to wait until they got off the plane to open it. Inside she tucked a $100 bill and the dangly earrings she'd been wearing.  ",
      "\"To the girls from Yugoslavia -\" her note on the outside of the envelope began. \"I am so sorry that the bombing of your country has caused your family any problems. I hope your stay in America will be a safe and happy one for you - Welcome to America - please use this to help you here. A friend from the plane - TRACY\".  ",
      "Peck had no idea how much that gesture would come to mean to its recipients - and how much writing it would end up changing her life, too.  ",
      "Contino, who's now 41 and an anesthesiologist in Connecticut, sees the envelope as a reason why she still tries to prioritize giving to people in need, and why she's teaching her two daughters to do that, too.   ",
      "Zugay, a 35-year-old who lives in Boston, sees Peck's simple act of generosity as the foundation of many things in her life, including her work with numerous nonprofits and the consulting company she cofounded.  ",
      "And now that they're finally reunited, Zugay wants to make sure Peck knows how much it's meant.  ",
      "\"I thought of you for so many years,\" she says. \"It was almost like you were next to me in the things I was doing.\"  ",
      "Zugay unzips a black backpack, pulls out the envelope and hands it to Peck.  ",
      "It's in remarkably good condition, with no major wrinkles or tears. Zugay keeps it with her important documents and has tried hard to protect it.   ",
      "\"This is so wonderful,\" Peck says. \"I just can't believe you kept this all these years.\"   ",
      "Peck says she's amazed Zugay kept searching when so many others would have given up.  ",
      "\"Thank you so much for everything, Tracy,\" Zugay says. \"You're such a beautiful person. I'm so excited for your joy to radiate across the planet.\"  ",
      "Zugay tells Peck she still remembers having a panic attack once when she thought she'd lost the envelope, and the many hours she spent looking at it and searching for clues. For so many years, that piece of paper seemed to be the only thing connecting her to a puzzle in her past she needed to solve.  ",
      "Now that she and Peck have reunited, the envelope itself doesn't seem as important. But what it symbolizes seems more important than ever. And that, Zugay says, is why she's determined to keep telling the story.  ",
      "\"It's been really beautiful to be able to elevate the message of welcoming people, and encouraging people to be kind,\" she says. \"You don't have to be a wealthy philanthropist; you don't have to be somebody who has a lot of power. You can be an average person, and you can have an incredible impact on somebody's life.\"  ",
      "Since CNN's coverage of her search began, Zugay estimates she's received more than 2,300 emails from readers who were moved by Tracy's story.  ",
      "Some shared their own experiences of reaching out to others or receiving unexpected support at moments when they felt lost.   ",
      "One person wrote that they'd been dangerously close to suicide but reconsidered after reading about Zugay's search for Tracy.  ",
      "\"Something woke up in me that was quiet for so long. ... Instead of ending my life that day, I walked around the city feeling gratitude for people like Tracy in my life,\" the note said. \"Now when I think about what I hope to build out of my life, I will always think of you and Tracy.\"  ",
      "Zugay says it's been overwhelming and inspiring to receive so many beautiful messages.  ",
      "But while most responses have been positive, a few negative emails have also made their way to her inbox.   ",
      "To Zugay, that's important to acknowledge, too.   ",
      "\"That's why I do the work I do,\" she says. \"The goal is for everybody here to feel belonging and welcome and to thrive.\"  ",
      "And no matter how many negative responses she gets, Zugay says finding Tracy makes it all worthwhile.  ",
      "When Peck learned she'd be traveling to New York, there was one thing she knew she wanted to see with Zugay and Contino: the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.   ",
      "\"To me, the whole idea of Christmas is about love and giving and kindness,\" Peck says. And who better to see the tree with than the women who'd given her such a beautiful reminder of how a small act of kindness can grow into something so much bigger?  ",
      "So after hours of swapping stories about their family members, discussing their lives and careers, and sharing memories of the past and dreams for the future, the trio venture out to the packed sidewalks of Midtown Manhattan for a glimpse of the iconic sight.  ",
      "At points, it feels like someone is shoving them from every direction. In the commotion, Zugay and Contino try to keep their eyes trained on Peck's blonde hair.  ",
      "\"We can't lose Tracy now,\" Contino laughs, \"not after we finally found her.\"  ",
      "They marvel at the Saks Fifth Avenue holiday lights display and snap selfies beside the tree.  ",
      "\"So beautiful,\" Peck says.  ",
      "And no matter how crowded the sidewalks around them get, the three women stick together.  ",
      "Reuniting in person, Peck says, has brought even more unexpected joy than their initial conversation.   ",
      "\"Love and friendship among women is to me among the greatest gifts in the world,\" she says. \"I feel I've gained that bond with these two amazing women.\"  ",
      "Waiting backstage the next day as they prepare for their appearance on \"CNN Heroes,\" the women marvel at the stories of this year's honorees.   ",
      "\"There are good people in this world,\" Contino says.  ",
      "Zugay nods in agreement.   ",
      "Before long, a familiar voice echoes in the event space as a video plays that includes excerpts from their May reunion on Zoom.   ",
      "It's Tracy - the Tracy. Hearing her voice makes Zugay feel instantly emotional. Now they're together at last.  ",
      "The audience gives them a standing ovation as they walk on stage side by side.  ",
      "As they return to their New York hotel after the show, they rehash highlights of the night - the celebrities who stopped them in the hallway to marvel at their story, the many honorees doing extraordinary things for their communities and, best of all, the fact that they got to spend an entire weekend together after so many years apart.   ",
      "Peck thinks back to the young girls she met on the plane and how brave they were that day.  ",
      "\"I wouldn't have been nearly as strong as you were. I wouldn't have been mature enough to do it. ... I'm so proud of you, the two women you've become,\" she says.  ",
      "Zugay thinks back to her many years searching for Tracy, and what she hoped she'd find.  ",
      "\"You turned out to be so much more than I ever expected,\" Zugay tells Peck. \"Just hearing your voice means so much to me. I can't wait to hear about our future days together.\"  ",
      "They're hoping to plan a bigger reunion so more members of their families can meet. And next year, Zugay hopes Peck will be a guest at her wedding.   ",
      "Still reveling in the many inspiring stories of the evening and the chance they had to share the moment together, Zugay says she feels so overwhelmed with gratitude that she won't be able to sleep.   ",
      "Over the years, the efforts of so many people helped her find Tracy - at least 17, by her latest count, from the first journalist to cover her story for the Minneapolis Star-Tribune to the videographer who helped her get the word out on social media.   ",
      "Tonight, she can only think of one thing to do: write her own notes, just like Tracy did, thanking them.  "

      "Online voters selected her from among this year's Top 10 CNN Heroes.  ",
      "Cheboi's nonprofit, TechLit Africa, has provided thousands of students across rural Kenya with access to donated, upcycled computers - and the chance at a brighter future.  ",
      "Cheboi accepted the award with her mother, who she said \"worked really hard to educate us.\" At the beginning of her acceptance speech, Cheboi and her mother sang a song onstage  that she explained had a special meaning when she was growing up.    ",
      "As CNN Hero of the Year, Cheboi will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday's gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit.  ",
      "Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. \"I know the pain of poverty,\" said Cheboi, 29. \"I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.\"  ",
      "A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop.  ",
      "Everything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major.  ",
      "\"When I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,\" she told CNN.  ",
      "Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum.  ",
      "\"I feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,\" she said.  ",
      "Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which  computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure.  ",
      "\"We have kids here (in Kenya) - myself included, back in the day - who don't even know what a computer is,\" she said.  ",
      "So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya - in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself.  ",
      "\"At one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,\" she said.  ",
      "A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals.  ",
      "The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it's shipped to Kenya. There, it's distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs.  ",
      "\"We have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,\" Cheboi said. \"They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.\"  ",
      "The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more.  ",
      "\"My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they're able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,\" Cheboi said. \"The world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.\"  ",

      "Joyce DeFauw, then Joyce Viola Kane, started her freshman year at Northern Illinois University in 1951 with a plan to graduate with a degree in home economics.  ",

      "\"I guess I mentioned I was upset that I didn't finish school and my children encouraged me to go back,\" she said, so she enrolled back at Northern Illinois and began taking classes.  ",

      "\"When we made calls to the school about a previous enrollment, they were shocked to hear we were asking about a student from the 50s,\" Dooley said.  ",
      "But this time around, things were much different for DeFauw.  ",
      "Instead of walking to campus to attend class, she did so behind a computer screen from her retirement home.  ",
      "\"It was my first computer,\" DeFauw said, \"My children had to teach me how to use it.\"  ",
      "Dooley added her uncle Don, DeFauw's oldest son, helped set up the computer, get a camera for the computer and taught her how to navigate her school email.  ",
      "When the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020, she was thankful for the computer, Dooley said. \"It worked out really well that she was already set up online,\" She added.  ",
      "She was on her own during that time and could have no visitors, Dooley said. \"At times she'd get frustrated, but I kept reminding her that this was all a part of the process.\" She added.  ",

      "He spent the latter part of his career focusing on global environmental issues - most recently producing \"This American Land\" which airs on PBS stations across the US.   ",
      "This career shift came about in the mid-1990s after an encounter with Ted Turner, CNN's founder, who shared Strieker's passion about conservation and the environment.   ",
      "\"(Gary) had this idea he wanted to be CNN's environmental reporter,\" said Norgaard. \"Every year or so we had (a) conference in Atlanta and I walked down there with Gary and I hear Ted yell, 'Gary! Come sit here!' and he announces to everyone, 'Gary is our guy in Africa!'    ",
      "\"They sat down and started talking and then Gary just mentioned this idea to him about environmental (reporting) and I remember Ted turning around, looking at Tom Johnson (CNN's president at the time) and going, 'Tom, this is brilliant! I love it, let's make it happen!\"  ",
      "Other colleagues who recalled the story said Johnson later half-jokingly swore never to sit a correspondent next to Turner again.   ",
      "In 1997, Strieker and his second wife Christine moved to Atlanta where he worked as CNN's global environment correspondent.  His reporting on central Africa's bushmeat crisis, as well as deforestation in Indonesia, Peru and Papua New Guinea, earned him the National Press Club's top prize for environmental reporting in 2000.   ",
      "\"Gary was, in a lot of ways, ahead of his time - he was pushing for environmental reporting years before any other network,\" Norgaard recalled.   ",
      "Norgaard, CNN's former Johannesburg bureau chief, was a junior editor on the network's international desk in Atlanta when he first began working with Strieker.    ",
      "\"I was born and grew up in Africa, so we kind of had a special understanding,\" he said.   ",
      "Strieker was different than many international correspondents at the time who, Norgaard said, could be \"really wound-up\" and rude when they called the international desk.  ",
      "\"That was never him,\" Norgaard said.  \"He was always calm, courteous ... that's what I will never forget about Gary. I didn't know him that closely, but he's someone you considered a friend.\"  ",
      "Born in the small Illinois town of Breese on July 7, 1944, Strieker grew up in San Diego, California - eventually earning a law degree from UC-Hastings in San Francisco. Strieker and his first wife, Phyllis, joined one of the first US Peace Corps teams in 1968 on a mission to the newly independent African Kingdom of Swaziland - now Eswatini.  ",
      "Strieker spent five years in Swaziland serving as a legal advisor to the new sovereign government and helping draft a bill to protect Swazi land rights. During this time, his eldest daughter Lindsay was born. Strieker took a job with Citibank in Beirut in 1975 during the early days of the Lebanese civil war before returning to Africa as Citibank's resident vice president for its regional office in Nairobi, Kenya.   ",
      "Strieker's twin daughters, Rachel and Alison, were born in Nairobi, and some health complications put Alison's life at risk.  ",
      " \"The doctor at the hospital who was taking care of me was just very nonchalant and said, 'Well ... we'll see if she makes it through the night,'\" said Alison Strieker, recalling her dad's story. \"And my dad said, 'Is there something we can do?' and the doctor said 'She needs blood for a transfusion.'\"  ",
      "Gary Strieker said he asked the nurses to test his blood type and he was a match. Years later, Alison said her dad saved her life a second time when he donated his kidney to her.  ",
      "\"He's my favorite person on earth,\" Alison Strieker said. \"I still have his kidney to this day.\"  ",
      "As his daughters were growing up, they were the center of his life and he captured many moments of their young lives on a movie camera and an old Kodak \"Brownie\" camera.   ",
      "His passion for photography sparked his pivot to journalism.    ",
      "\"The photography mainly got him interested in not just the images but telling a story ... about people and places and animals that do not have a voice - and that seemed to be his real passion,\" Alison Strieker recalled.  ",
      "After a brief stint with ABC News, he joined CNN in the early 1980s, setting up the new network's bureau in Nairobi and becoming its only correspondent on the African continent at the time.     ",
      "\"Gary entered the world of reporting in countries in Africa at a time in the 1980s when long-running conflicts in Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia coincided with drought and famine (and) led to large refugee crises,\" former CNN supervising editor Eli Flournoy recalled.   ",
      "\"Gary was there on the ground, year after year, covering, documenting, illustrating these endemic conflicts.\"   ",
      "Strieker had a lot of close calls during his reporting career.  ",
      "\"He was in crash landings in planes, he was in car accidents where other people died - he was just very dedicated,\" his oldest daughter Lindsay Strieker said.  ",
      "After a car accident in Rwanda, he was declared dead and taken to the morgue.   ",
      "\"He woke up in the morgue as a toe tag was being attached and said it damn near killed the medical worker when he sat up,\" recalled Jim Clancy, former CNN anchor and international correspondent.   ",
      "He had another brush with death while reporting on the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo, that left hundreds dead.  ",
      "\"Gary ... fearlessly went in and covered the Ebola patients and the operations of the (Kikwit) hospital, which was one of the first of its kind to treat an infectious outbreak like Ebola,\" Flournoy recalled. \"It was a very, very dangerous environment.\"  ",
      "At one point, the local authorities began implementing a quarantine and approached Strieker, who they believed had been exposed to Ebola.    ",
      "\"They were going to put him in the hospital's Ebola wing,\" Flournoy said.    ",
      "Equipped with a satellite phone, Strieker called the international desk in a panic.   ",
      "\"He (said) 'We have to do something to prevent this from happening, because I will almost certainly die if I'm quarantined in this hospital,'\" Flournoy said.  ",
      "After a \"mad scramble\" which involved lots of phone calls and the intervention of United Nations officials, Strieker was allowed to leave the country instead.    ",
      "\"Gary continued to be unflappable, determined to get down to the facts of the story at the same time as being able to always find the human story within the larger conflict,\" Flournoy said. \"He was a remarkable storyteller.\"  ",
      "Strieker never lost his curiosity or energy for shining a light on critical stories about people who are impacted by global health and environmental crises.    ",
      "\"It was never about getting his face on TV or a higher Nielsen rating,\" said Dave Timko who worked with Strieker on \"This American Land.\"   ",
      "Strieker only cared about using his platforms to tell the stories of people across the world who were in need.  ",
      "\"Sometimes he'd say, 'If I don't go to those places, nobody's doing those stories,'\" his widow Christine Nkini Strieker said.  ",
      "He was a devoted father to the couple's two children Reid, 20, and Nandi, 16, sharing stories with them at dinnertime about his adventures and spending every moment he could with his family when he wasn't on assignment.  ",
      "Even when he became ill, Christine said that Strieker was determined to get better so he could start working again.  ",
      "\"He refused to say, I'm too sick to do anything,\" she said.     ",
      "After Strieker's passing in July, friends and former colleagues flooded a shared Facebook page with memories - all recounting Strieker's incredible stories, his quiet bravery in the midst of incredibly dangerous reporting assignments, his wit and genuine devotion to the craft of journalism.  ",
      "\"His message to us was, 'Life, with its ups and downs, is an adventure - and it's important to stay curious and compassionate,'\" said his daughter Rachel.  ",
      "It's some comfort to the loved ones he leaves behind, including his five children and three surviving grandchildren, who are picking up the pieces after his passing.    ",
      "\"The more we don't look at the sadness and the more we look at the positive in the life he gave us  -  that's the thing I want my kids to carry on,\" Christine Strieker said.  "
