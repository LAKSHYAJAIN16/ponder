", "There are now between 130 and 160 of the hippos, according to the Colombian government, and they have spread out far beyond Escobar's former ranch of Hacienda Napoles, where they began as a population of just one male and three females.  ", "The original hippos were part of a collection of exotic animals Escobar had amassed in the 1980s at his ranch about 250 kilometers (155 miles) from Medell\u00edn. After his death in 1993, authorities relocated most of the other animals, but not the hippos - because they were too difficult to transport.  ", "But they have since begun to reproduce rapidly, extending their reach along the Magdalena River basin, and they now pose an environmental challenge and are concerning nearby residents, authorities say.  ", "A study in the journal Nature warned their numbers could balloon to 1,500 within two decades.  ", "Previously, authorities have tried to control their population using castrations and \"shots\" of contraceptive darts. But the contraceptive drives have had limited success.  ", "Now there's a plan to transfer 70 of the hippos to natural sanctuaries in India and Mexico, the governor of Antioquia province, where Hacienda Napoles is located, said in a Tweet.  ", "A total of 70 hippos, a mix of males and females, are expected to be moved - with 60 going to India and 10 to Mexico.  ", "The technical term for this operation is \"translocating,\" governor An\u00edbal Gaviria explained in an interview with the Colombian outlet Blu Radio, as it would involve moving the hippos from one country that was not their native habitat to another that was also not their natural habitat.  ", "The goal was \"to take them to countries where these institutions have the capacity to receive them, and to (home) them properly and to control their reproduction,\" Gaviria said.   ", "Sending the hippos back to their native land of Africa was \"not allowed,\" Gaviria said.  ", "Sending the hippos back to Africa risked doing more harm than good, for both the hippos themselves and the local ecosystem, Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngela Echeverry, professor of Biology at the Javeriana University, previously explained to CNN.  ", "\"Every time we move animals or plants from one place to the other, we also move their pathogens, their bacteria and their viruses. And we could be bringing new diseases to Africa, not just for the hippos that are out there in the wild, but new diseases for the entire African ecosystem that hasn't evolved with that type of disease,\" Echeverry said.  ", "Aside from reducing the number of hippos in Colombia, authorities are hoping to learn how to manage the remaining population, which are recognized as a potential tourist attraction.  ", "The hippos will be flown in purpose-built boxes, Gaviria said in the radio interview, and will not be sedated at first.   ", "But \"emergency sedation\" is possible if one of the animals is overcome by nerves during the flight, he added.  ", "The translocation could be completed by the first half of this year if necessary permits are expedited, especially from the Colombian Agricultural Institute, Gaviria said.  ", "Hippos are seen by some as an invasive species that can pose a danger to local ecosystems and sometimes even to humans.  ", "Research has highlighted the negative effects hippo waste can have on oxygen levels in bodies of water, which can affect fish and ultimately humans.   ", "Nature magazine cited a 2019 paper that found lakes where hippos were present had more cyanobacteria, which are associated with toxic algae. These blooms can reduce water quality and cause mass fish deaths, affecting local fishing communities.  ", "Hippos can also pose a threat to agriculture and to people's safety, according to a Biological Conservation study published in 2021. Hippos can eat or damage crops and engage in aggressive interactions with humans.   ", "\"Hippos live in herds, they are quite aggressive. They are very territorial and are plant eaters in general,\" said Professor Echeverry.  ", "While the \"cocaine hippos\" are not native to Colombia, the local terrain is thought to be favorable for their reproduction, since it has shallow water sources and a large concentration of food.  ", "Until now, Colombia has not been able to solve a problem that - in the words of Gaviria to Blu Radio - \"got out of control.\"   ", "Whether the latest efforts will succeed where birth control efforts failed remains to be seen.

Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro will speak on the same stage where a few hours later former US leader Donald Trump will deliver the event's closing remarks - a man the Brazilian leader has intentionally mirrored from the beginning of his presidency.   ", "Far from his home country, Bolsonaro has found a warm reception in America: on social media, mostly Brazilian fans post videos of meeting Bolsonaro outside his south Florida rental and running into him in parking lots, food courts, and grocery stores, where the former president appears in shorts and sandals, grinning and posing for photos with children.   ", "Bolsonaro has made a number of appearances in US hotel conference rooms and evangelical churches targeting Brazilian expats, giving speeches that come across as both timid and awkward, as he pauses to wait for interpreters to catch up to him, not always seeming certain of what is being said.   ", "In early February, he spoke in the auditorium of a Trump hotel just outside Miami, hosted by none other than conservative activist and far-right organizer Charlie Kirk.  Kirk, who admitted to not knowing much about Brazil, was nonetheless flanked by the flags of both nations: a gold-fringed, star-spangled banner and Brazil's unmistakeable bright green flag with a yellow diamond and blue circle in the center.   \"The fight against socialism and Marxism knows no borders,\" Kirk said by way of introduction to an audience of mostly Brazilians who were there to see Bolsonaro - \"the myth,\" or legend, as they call him.   ", "In a separate podcast interview, Kirk and Bolsonaro enthusiastically described common ground between the Brazilian and American right. Describing his decision to snub Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's swearing in, Bolsonaro said: \"I didn't want to be accused of collaborating with the clumsy way they began their mandate, because we have completely opposing political views: conservative, on the right, and theirs, closer to socialism on the left.\"   ", "\"Sounds very similar to what we're dealing with in the United States,\" Kirk responded.  ", "The commonalities go on. From expanding gun rights and downplaying COVID-19 to opposing abortion and advocating for tougher immigration policies, Bolsonaro and Trump had plenty in common while in office. The two have continued to mirror each other since then; both shunned their successors' inauguration ceremonies and fled to the embrace of conservative society circles in Florida, where Trump moved his residence and where Bolsonaro has been living for more than two months.   ", "But there's another reason for Bolsonaro's tour of the United States: his continued appearances on US stages serve strategic purposes for far-right movements in both countries.  ", "For Bolsonaro, participating in US political events shores up his claims that he has not exited politics and will eventually assume again leadership of Brazil's rightwing opposition, despite his current sojourn abroad.   ", "For the American right, publicly allying with a foreign figure helps expand their reach and creates the appearance of confirming conspiracy theories that originate in the US. In 2022, it was Hungarian hardline leader Viktor Orban who made headlines at CPAC. This year, it's Bolsonaro.  ", "Deputy Director of Rapid Response at Media Matters Madeline Peltz, who researches right wing media and has been tracking the way extreme rightwing figures like Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones talk about Brazil, says American and Brazilian activists can see each others' countries as laboratories in which to test and observe tactics.  ", "After a bruising midterm election, Peltz adds,  Republicans are now wondering whether to continue down the path of being pushed farther to the right or to take a more measured approach, distancing themselves from election denialism and the violent acts of January 6, 2021, conveniently chalking that kind of behavior to the radicals of their party.   ", "\"The Republican Party was sort of testing this thesis about, do we continue down this path of Trumpism, of extreme election denial, and that was being reflected in the right wing media's commentary on Brazil as well - they were testing that thesis both in the American elections and in the Brazilian elections,\" Peltz said.   ", "The blueprint hasn't shown the expected results, she said. \"Republicans underperformed, to be charitable, and Bolsonaro lost.\"  ", "In this balancing act, Bolsonaro is trying to figure out where he fits in. Though he denounced the invasion of Brasilia on January 8 by his supporters, in the days following the election he welcomed peaceful demonstrations while his party filed petitions for an audit of voting machines, alleging fraud. He fed his followers crumbs of misinformation about election fraud and made vague comments hinting at a potential coup.   ", "When asked if Bolsonaro was not too problematic and messy to be brought into American politics - as a one-term president who infamously defended rape, torture, and a military dictatorship and is currently facing multiple criminal investigations at home - Peltz quipped, \"They get their power from problematic and messy.\" Shock value and controversy can actually confer clout in the American political universe, she said.    ", "Prominent American conservatives have long lent support to Bolsonaro. \"(Steve) Bannon has long considered himself to sort of be the international boogeyman of the left,\" and his \"next act\" after leaving the White House was to form a sort of global coalition of far right movements, Peltz said. Brazil was one winning example of his political penetration.   ", "Bolsonaro brought in Bannon to advise his first  presidential campaign back in 2018 - and Bannon in turn began mentioning the South American leader more and more to his American audience, posing for photos with Bolsonaro's children on US visits, and voicing his support for the president on his social media whenever he was under fire.  ", "He is not the only one. In the days that followed the Brazilian presidential elections in November, as Bolsonaro and his party filed petitions for tens of thousands of votes to be thrown out, another prominent conservative voice joined in. Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson raised questions about whether the vote was legitimate - despite Brazilian courts rejecting fraud claims and a military investigation finding no evidence of rigged voting machines.  ", "Rodrigo Nunes, a philosophy professor at University of Essex and author of \"From Trance to Vertigo,\" a book of essays about Bolsonarismo, said that Bolsonaro's value to US conservatives comes from two factors.   ", "First, \"he's a former president of a fairly important country. Geopolitically, he was a fairly important ally to Trump, because he was 100% aligned with Trump.\" As a former leader in the global far-right and part of the \"ecology,\" Bolsonaro's voice can be amplified in the US whenever his ideas are relevant, Nunes said.   ", "Second, Bolsonaro frequently mimics and echoes the discourse of the far right in the US, which can be fed back into the US as offering further confirmation of what the far right are saying there, Nunes explained.   ", "\"That's a lot of how this ecological approach to political organization works. When you're using the internet, how do you make something real? You spread sufficient sources of it so that it looks like it's coming from several different places at the same time, and suddenly, this produces an effect of reality, it looks like it's real, because there's a lot of people saying it and where there's smoke, there's fire.\"  ", "In a way, the cycle is exemplified in the copycat insurrection that took place in Brasilia on January 8. It's impossible not to see the influence of January 6 in the actions of the rioters there, and yet \"the Brazilian Jan 6\" was defended by Carlson and Bannon even as the reaction from Bolsonaro and many in his camp was mixed.   ", "The day after the Brasilia riots, Bolsonaro condemned the acts in a tweet.  \"Peaceful demonstrations that follow the law are part of democracy. However, depredations and invasions of public buildings as occurred today, as well as those practiced by the left in 2013 and 2017, escape the rule,\" he said.  ", "But in American politics, what Bolsonaro thinks or says matters less than what the invasion of public buildings thousands of miles away means for American voters who believe that their own election was stolen.   ", "\"The way his narrative is built, to a large extent, as a copy or a mirror image of the narrative that they have in the US is very useful in the sense of showing people this is happening in other places, too. This proves the whole idea that there is a global conspiracy, a global left wing conspiracy to keep us, the people who represent the real people, out of power,\" Nunes said.   ", "In another recent speaking event, Bolsonaro took the pulpit of an evangelical church in Boca Raton, Florida, and told a crowd of Brazilians, \"My mission is not over yet.\"   ", "In the same breath as he exalted the wonders of Brazil, (\"There is nothing like our own land\"), he urged his supporters to not be discouraged, and said he was planning to return to Brazil in the coming weeks to lead the opposition against Lula. If that is true, CPAC could be his last appearance in American politics before going home to an uncertain political future.   ", "To Peltz, it would be the natural conclusion of what she described as Bolsonaro's \"strange, directionless detour to America,\" given CPAC's waning influence in the American political landscape. \"CPAC no longer launches the careers of hopefuls looking to make an impact, rather, it's now simply a box to check off. And without much otherwise on his to-do list, Bolsonaro might as well check it off.\"  "], "headline": "Why the American far right adopted Brazilian ex-President Jair Bolsonaro    ", "timestamp": "  Published  12:01 AM EST, Sat March 4, 2023    ", "act": "/2023/03/04/americas/cpac-2023-bolsonaro-brazil-intl-latam"}, "/2023/03/03/americas/navalny-daughter-dasha-navalnaya-intl": {"paras": ["Dasha Navalnaya, the daughter of jailed Russian dissident Alexey Navalny, has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine and to release her father and political prisoners in the country, in an extensive interview with CNN's Erin Burnett on Friday.

If a predator such as an eagle sees a dwarf boa coiled up and bleeding from its eyes, \"the predator is very likely to think that the snake might be either sick or dying, so therefore it will not feed on it\" to avoid catching whatever made the snake seem ill.  ", "However, dwarf boas face far bigger threats than predators: The newly identified species may already be endangered due to habitat loss. \"It has a fairly small range,\" Entiauspe-Neto said. \"So while it still needs to be formally evaluated by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), I think it might be threatened with extinction.\"  ", "Tha\u00eds Guedes, a researcher at the State University of Campinas in Brazil who was not involved with the study, praised the work. \"I am always happy when I see a new species of snake being introduced to the world,\" Guedes said.
