It would take effect in May.  ", "Among its proposed new conditions on eligibility for US asylum: being denied protection in a third country through which they traveled.

", "Once registered with COMAR, asylum seekers are provided with deportation protection, access to the public health care system and work eligibility.

They used a preliminary COMAR document to travel within the country toward its northern border.  ", "\"They are abusing the system,\" said Ram\u00edrez. \"That shows us that many of these people are not really interested in (Mexico's) refugee system and the asylum procedure.\"  ", "He estimated that in Tapachula, Mexico about 70% of the individuals from countries other than Haiti were abusing the system.

Hours after joining the march, he was shot in the abdomen near Ayacucho's airport, where protesters had gathered with some trying to take control of the runway.

Its capital, also called Ayacucho now, was one of main cities during the Spanish conquest. It was also the birthplace of one of the darkest and painful chapters in Peru's recent history, home to the armed rebel group Shining Path during the violent 80's and 90's.  ", "According to the final report of the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, almost 70,000 people ultimately died due to the internal conflict between Peruvian security forces and the Maoist rebel group Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso in Spanish), and the Marxist-Leninist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). Both government forces and the rebel groups were accused of human rights violations as they warred. More than 40% of the deaths and missing from this bloody conflict were in the Ayacucho region.  ", "Since then, this region has welcomed local and international tourists, relies on agriculture, mining, and manufacturing of local products. But it still reflects the inequalities of the past.

One of them is accused of handing money to the protesters and allegedly taking part in planning the attacks against public and private property.
