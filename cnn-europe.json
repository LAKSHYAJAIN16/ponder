", "In many respects, that is unsurprising. There is little room for dissenting voices on Russian airwaves; the propaganda beamed from state-controlled TV stations since the onset of war has at times attracted derision around the world, so overblown are their more fanatical presenters and pundits.

And had we not acted first, war would have been unleashed against us,\" she added, mirroring the false claims of victimhood at the hands of the West that state media relentlessly communicate.

", "\"Everything I hear on state channels I split in half. I don't trust anyone (entirely),\" 55-year-old accountant Tatyana said. \"One needs to analyze everything ... because certain things they are omitting, (or) not saying,\" said Leonid, a 58-year-old engineer.

They support their side, (but) would rather have it finished and fighting stopped.\"  ", "This group of people tends to pay less attention to the war, according to Natalia Savelyeva, a Future Russia Fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) who has interviewed hundreds of Russians since the invasion to trace the levels of public support for the conflict. \"We call them 'doubters,'\" she said.

But if the Kremlin cannot expect all-out support across its populace, sociologists say it can at least rely on apathy.  ", "\"I try to avoid watching news on the special military operation because I start feeling bad about what's going on,\" Natalya added. \"So I don't watch.\"  ", "She is far from alone. \"The major attitude is not to watch (the news) closely, not to discuss it with colleagues or friends. Because what can you do about it?\" said Volkov. \"Whatever you say, whatever you want, the government will do what they want.\"  ", "That feeling of futility means anti-war protests in Russia are rare and noteworthy, a social contract that suits the Kremlin. \"People don't want to go and protest; first, because it might be dangerous, and second, because they see it as a futile enterprise,\" Volkov said.  ", "\"What are we supposed to do? Our opinion means diddly squat,\" a woman told CNN in Moscow in January, anonymously discussing the conflict.  ", "The bulk of the population typically disengages instead. \"In general, those people try to distance themselves from what's going on,\" Savelyeva added. \"They try to live their lives as though nothing is happening.\"  ", "And a culture of silence - re-enforced by heavy-handed authorities - keeps many from sharing skepticism about the conflict. A married couple in the southwestern Russian city of Krasnodar were reportedly arrested in January for professing anti-war sentiments during a private conversation in a restaurant, according to the independent Russian monitoring group OVD-Info.   ", "\"I do have an opinion about the special military operation ... it remains the same to this day,\" Anna told CNN in Moscow. \"I can't tell you which side I support. I am for truth and justice. Let's leave it like that,\" she said.  ", "Keeping the war at arm's length has, however, become more difficult over the course of the past year. Putin's chaotic partial mobilization order and Russia's increasing economic isolation has brought the conflict to the homes of Russians, and communication with friends and relatives in Ukraine often paint a different picture of the war than that reported by state media.  ", "\"I have felt anxious ever since this began. It's affecting (the) availability of products and prices,\" a woman who asked to remain anonymous told CNN last month. \"There is a lack of public information. People should be explained things. Everyone is listening to Soloviev,\" she said, referring to prominent propagandist Vladimir Soloviev.   ", "\"It would be good if the experts started expressing their real opinions instead of obeying orders, from the government and Putin,\" the woman said.   ", "A film student, who said she hadn't heard from a friend for two months following his mobilization, added: \"I don't know what's happened to him. It would be nice if he just responded and said 'OK, I'm alive.'\"  ", "\"I just wish this special military operation never started in the first place - this war - and that human life was really valued,\" she said.  ", "For those working to break through the Kremlin's information blockade, Russia's quiet majority is a key target.

", "\"That's where we come in,\" Sukhotski said.  ", "The outlet is one of the most influential platforms bringing uncensored scenes from the Ukrainian frontlines into Russian-speaking homes, primarily through digital platforms still allowed by the Kremlin including YouTube, Telegram and WhatsApp.  ", "And interest has surged throughout the war, the network says. \"We saw traffic spikes after the mobilization, and after the Ukrainian counter-offensives, because people started to understand what (the war) means for their own communities and they couldn't get it from local media.\"  ", "Current Time, its 24/7 TV and digital network for Russians, saw a two-and-a-half-fold increase in Facebook views, and more than a three-fold rise in YouTube views, in the 10 months following the invasion, RFE/RL told CNN. Last year, QR codes which directed smartphone users to the outlet's website started popping up in Russian cities, which RFE/RL believed were stuck on lampposts and street signs by anti-war citizens.  ", "But independent outlets face a challenge reaching beyond internet natives, who tend to be younger and living in cities, and penetrating the media diet of older, poorer and rural Russians, who are typically more conservative and supportive of the war.   ", "\"We need to get to the wider audience in Russia,\" Sukhotski said. \"We see a lot of people indoctrinated by Russian state propaganda ... it will be an uphill battle but this is where we shape our strategy.\"  ", "Reaching Russians at all has not been easy. Most of RFE/RL's Russia-based staff made a frantic exit from the country after the invasion, following the Kremlin's crackdown on independent outlets last year, relocating to the network's headquarters in Prague.   ", "The same fate befell outlets like BBC Russia and Latvia-based Meduza, which were also targeted by the state.  ", "A new law made it a crime to disseminate \"fake\" information about the invasion of Ukraine - a definition decided at the whim of the Kremlin - with a penalty of up to 15 years in prison for anyone convicted. This month, a Russian court sentenced journalist Maria Ponomarenko to six years in prison for a Telegram post that the court said spread supposedly \"false information\" about a Russian airstrike on a theater in Mariupol, Ukraine, that killed hundreds, state news agency TASS reported.  ", "\"All our staff understand they can't go back to Russia,\" Sukhotski told CNN. \"They still have families there. They still have ailing parents there. We have people who were not able to go to their parents' funerals in the past year.\"  ", "His staff are \"still coming to terms with that,\" Sukhotski admitted. \"They are Russian patriots and they wish Russia well ... they see how they can help.\"  ", "Outlets like RFE/RL have openings across the digital landscape, in spite of Russia's move to ban Twitter, Facebook and other Western platforms last year.  ", "About a quarter of Russians use VPN services to access blocked sites, according to a Levada Center poll carried out two months after Russia's invasion.   ", "Searches for such services on Google spiked to record levels in Russia following the invasion, and have remained at their highest rates in over a decade ever since, the search engine's tracking data shows.   ", "YouTube meanwhile remains one of the few major global sites still accessible, thanks to its huge popularity in Russia and its value in spreading Kremlin propaganda videos.  ", "\"YouTube became the television substitute for Russia ... the Kremlin fear that if they don't have YouTube, they won't be able to control the flow of information to (younger people),\" Sukhotski said.  ", "And that allows censored organizations a way in. \"I watch YouTube. I watch everything there - I mean everything,\" one Moscow resident who passionately opposes the war told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"These federal channels I never watch,\" she said. \"I don't trust a word they say. They lie all the time! You've just got to switch on your logic, compare some information and you will see that it's all a lie.\"  ", "Telegram, meanwhile, has spiked in popularity since the war began, becoming a public square for military bloggers to analyze each day on the battlefield.  ", "At first, that analysis tended to mirror the Kremlin's line. But \"starting around September, when Ukraine launched their successful counter-offensives, everything started falling apart,\" said Olga Lautman, a US-based Senior Fellow at CEPA who studies the Kremlin's internal affairs and propaganda tactics. \"I've never seen anything like it,\" she said.

", "This month, a debacle in Vuhledar that saw Russian tanks veer wildly into minefields became the latest episode to expose those fissures. The former Defense Minister of the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic, Igor Girkin, sometimes known by his nom de guerre Igor Strelkov - now a  a strident critic of the campaign - said Russian troops \"were shot like turkeys at a shooting range.\" In another post, he called Russian forces \"morons.\" Several Russian commentators called for the dismissal of Lieutenant General Rustam Muradov, the commander of the Eastern Grouping of Forces.   ", "\"This public fighting is spilling over,\" Lautman told CNN. \"Russia has lost control of the narrative ... it has normally relied on having a smooth propaganda machine and that no longer exists.\"  ", "One year into an invasion that most Russians initially thought would last days, creaks in the Kremlin's control of information are showing.  ", "The impact of those fractures remains unclear. For now, Putin can rely on a citizenry that is generally either supportive of the conflict or too fatigued to proclaim its opposition.  ", "But some onlookers believe the pendulum of public opinion is slowly swinging away from the Kremlin.

Just digging, digging, digging, all night.\"   ", "Arieva, meanwhile, was back at the base of their territorial defense unit in Kyiv, trying to be helpful.

He was mostly manning checkpoints and forming a second line of defense, but he did find himself face-to-face with Russian troops a couple of times and was trained in firing anti-tank missiles. He refuses to go into details beyond saying he had used his weapons during that time. \"We were told not to talk about it,\" he said.  ", "Arieva, meanwhile, was working in a tiny office with eight other people, 7 a.m. until 10 p.m. every day. There were three small tables with barely enough space for the computers, let alone the people. Bounty and Snickers bars, cigarettes and tobacco sticks became hard currency during that time.  ", "They both admit the experience was a tough one.   ", "\"In our dreams, when we were imagining it, we were so heroic and strong. And the reality was that we washed once a week because there were no showers in there and it wasn't very pleasant, [with] the lack of sleep and sometimes food,\" she said.   ", "Still, they look back at the time with pride and fondness.  ", "\"Everyone forgot who they are, if they were very famous or very, very rich or very [influential] politicians, they were just helping each other, standing together smoking and not knowing what was going on,\" Arieva said.  ", "Arieva said she quit smoking just days before the war began, but her determination didn't last.  ", "\"I said I will quit on victory day, but I might have to try earlier,\" she said.  ", "When Russian troops withdrew from the Kyiv region in early April, Arieva and Fursin's time in the territorial defense came to an end. The military decided it needed to make the volunteer units more professional and only those with previous military experience were allowed to stay.  ", "Fursin and Arieva were asked to leave the force.  ", "\"It was hard to become civilians again, because we didn't want to be protected, we wanted to do something,\" she said.  ", "They tried to enjoy the small things, like the first cappuccino since the start of the war.  ", "\"It was the tastiest thing. That cappuccino with the foam, that beauty, that taste, it [the war] has really made us value things much more,\" she said.  ", "For Fursin, last year's invasion was the second of his life. He grew up in Crimea and was living on the Ukrainian peninsula when Russia forcibly annexed it in 2014. His grandmother was too ill to travel at the time, so they stayed.  ", "\"I remember how the place has changed after that. We used to joke that you go to sleep in one country and wake up in another,\" he said.  ", "When Fursin's family finally left Crimea, they settled in Irpin. Just three years later, their home was, once again, invaded by Russian troops.  ", "The couple describes the shock of coming back to Irpin after it was liberated in early April. The town north of Kyiv became the front line during the battle for the capital city. It was here that Ukrainian forces managed to repel the attack.    ", "The family home was still standing, but was severely damaged, with windows shattered and half of the building scorched.   ", "Back in the civilian world, the couple began volunteering, bringing food and basic supplies to liberated settlements north of Kyiv. The demand was so overwhelming that sometimes they had to make multiple trips a day.  ", "\"I remember Katyuzhanka, because we brought a lot of bread and macaroni and some pasta sauce and batteries and there was a huge amount of people waiting. We gave out everything we had and we had to go back and bring more bread because more than half [of the] people didn't get anything and they didn't have a slice of bread in that town,\" Arieva said.   ", "She still remembers people sharing terrifying stories of life under occupation and bursting into tears upon hearing strangers speak Ukrainian.  ", "\"It was really ... hard to even listen to these stories, it hurts,\" she said.   ", "Slowly, life started to return to normal. It was spring, and Kyiv was in full bloom. It really felt like renewal, they said.   ", "They had their official town hall wedding and a small celebration in May, mostly because the deposit was paid and non-refundable. Arieva finally got to introduce her husband to her 97-year-old great-grandmother.   ", "They had both lost their jobs right at the beginning of the invasion. Arieva was working for the Committee of Voters of Ukraine, an observer organization, and Fursin for a housing co-op in Irpin.   ", "As they started running out of money, they decided to focus on work and their studies.   ", "Over the summer, Fursin finally graduated from university. He began his degree in Crimea, but when his family fled the occupied peninsula in 2019, he had to start over. He is now working on and off on software development projects.  ", "Arieva, meanwhile, decided to focus on learning to code. Tech is the only sector that is still growing in Ukraine, because it allows people to work remotely.   ", "But their plan to work and study remotely got derailed when Russia launched a wave of attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in the fall. Working was quickly becoming impossible.  ", "\"We would have two hours of electricity, then five hours without electricity, then three hours of electricity, it was really demoralizing,\" Arieva said.  ", "\"The worst thing about that was that the streets weren't lit. And not all people use their torches or have [reflective] jackets to be seen on the road. And every week I would see a car crash from my balcony and some people died,\" she added.  ", "In the fall, they adopted a cat and called him Kus, Ukrainian for \"bite.\" Even now, months later, Fursin's arms are covered in cat scratches.  ", "As Christmas started approaching, the couple, along with their families, decided to switch the date they'd celebrate the Christmas holiday.  ", "Instead of January 7, which marks the birth of Jesus according to the Julian calendar, still used by the Russian Orthodox Church, they celebrated on December 24, which marks the birth of Jesus according to the Gregorian calendar.  ", "\"So we had two Christmases in 2022,\" Arieva said.  ", "Ukraine's Orthodox church announced in the fall that it would allow its churches to celebrate Christmas in December.  ", "\"It makes more sense. It was more symbolic and I really liked it. And also it feels good that we are not celebrating with Russians anymore,\" Arieva said.  ", "The family didn't have the usual full spread of 12 dishes for Christmas dinner, because the electricity was on for just six hours that day. They cooked Kutia, the traditional Ukrainian porridge-like Christmas meal that consists of wheat or rice, raisins, walnuts, honey and poppy seeds, using the emergency gas cylinder.  ", "As the first anniversary of the war - and their wedding - approaches, Arieva and Fursin are reflecting on how the year has changed them.   ", "Arieva said she is a completely different person. \"I became less naive and less childish. And maybe it has made me a little bit stronger. Because what doesn't kill us, makes us stronger, of course,\" she said.   ", "\"Only when you see this, you understand the value of life. And for me, this is 100%,\" Fursin said. \"What we went through together, I understand that [we are] completely different. And that we [continue] to love each other, that, for me, is maybe the biggest sign that it's true love,\" he said.   "], "headline": "They got married the day Russia invaded.

It also worked to counter a sense that morality, and the virtue of values, were becoming obsolete in the face of the many challenges posed by the world's crises.  ", "It shouldn't have taken the deaths of thousands of innocent Ukrainians, the threat of nuclear attack, and the leveling of so much of a country, to make this point. But it's perhaps the revulsion to Putin's brutal and inept war that helped Europe and the rest of the West rediscover a collective sense of purpose.

They never thought they'd live long enough to see worse than the 1940s.  ", "Wars can intensify scrutiny of both sides' conduct to the point where each can be accused of some degree of wrongdoing. So, it's important to pause at this point and consider the ugliness of the way Russia has waged this war.  ", "Firstly, Moscow won't even admit that it's at war - a sign of the fictional landscape in which it wishes to fight.  ", "Secondly, Moscow has burned through its professional army so fast, it is press-ganging students to the front, and resorting to unleashing human waves of Russian prisoners at Ukrainian trenches. Some return in coffins, the injured are sent back to fight.    ", "Thirdly, the lack of sophistication - or even basic self-awareness - is striking. The Russian high command doesn't even seem to want to address how bad it is. In the background, the threat of nuclear force has been brandished so ineptly - in chest-pounding signals from a weak Kremlin which is losing the most conventional of fights - it appears to have had the almost opposite effect, galvanizing the West into concerted action in the face of what amounts to nuclear blackmail.  ", "Ukraine's response has been further fuel to Western unity. Ingenuity has bolstered the Ukrainians' defense. A territorial defense fighter, known as \"Graf,\" could talk in Kramatorsk for hours about the complexities of syncing drone surveillance to artillery, then switch to the role of Western private contractors in the war, and end with a blistering critique on the role alcoholism and corruption would have on the bones of Russia's nuclear program.  ", "Ukraine is sending its best and brightest to fight, and adapting to warfare faster than imaginable, while Russia is forcing convicts to run straight into the hail of bullets from Kyiv's machine guns.  ", "In the past year, fear of Moscow has begun to evaporate. The Cold War foe that could vaporize our world - whose warheads were the menace behind so many childhood animations and movies in the 80s - has not recovered and lost the internal blindness and shoddiness that led to the Soviet collapse. It's as bad as it was, only more desperate - its elite twice-humiliated, first in the 90s, and now.  ", "The Russian dead I witnessed, sprawled all over the roadside as Ukraine advanced in Kherson this summer, were scruffy, with a sleeping mat and workout gloves for comfort, and only rusting armor at their backs.   ", "There is something tragic about how fast Russia has fallen. Deservedly so, perhaps, but pause also to remember that the first Putin years contained, despite their massacres in Chechnya and slow strangulation of dissent, a kernel of economic reform and progress for ordinary Russians. Putin was creating the middle class that would ultimately risk his downfall.  ", "Now all that is gone, and a shrinking population will rasp on the edges of Europe for years to come. Whether Russia requires a harsh reprimand or not, the impact of its demise will be another problem Europe has to endure up close.   ", "What's most startling about the choice Moscow has imposed on the West - to seek its strategic defeat in Ukraine rather than its limited appeasement - is that Europe was heading in the other direction a year ago.  ", "Defense budgets were growing in recognition of Russian malice, but the broad hope was that Putin would be a benign, grumpy neighbor arguing over the border fence, rather than a savage marauder bent on restoring an empire so aged in concept not even he was old enough to have seen it in full.  ", "The West is engaged in an act of full-throated support of Ukraine that it's fair to say most of its officials would have deemed far too provocative a year ago. Sending tanks, thinking of F16s, training troops... It's hard to argue this isn't already NATO's war too, fought by proxy.  ", "Is that a bad thing? For Ukraine, yes, whose sacrifice should never have had to happen. So much loss remains hidden: I recall being inside and shivering outside the administration building of Mykolaiv at the start of the war. Now all I can think of is how many must have been inside it when a missile tore it in two in March.

The Great Power was never meant to falter so explicitly, or so ineptly inspire unity in the foes it had worked so hard to divide.

We know the consequences of nuclear weapons use for their victims and ordinary Russians. But that's not stopped Putin up to now.

The year ahead will likely see the non-conventional menace of a desperate Russia grow, and the slow tiring of Western support, as elections churn and budgets are strained.

", "That's what Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian mercenary group Wagner, appears to have done this week in an unusual public appeal for ammunition for his fighters in Ukraine. And in the process, he has cast a harsh light on his open feud with Russia's military leadership on the eve of the anniversary of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.   ", "On Wednesday, Prigozhin posted a picture on Telegram showing the bodies of several dozen slain Wagner fighters, piled unceremoniously in a courtyard. Alongside that shocking photo, he posted the image of a formal request from Wagner for more ammunition, pointing the finger of blame squarely at the Russian Ministry of Defense for squandering one of those lives.   ", "\"This is one of the gathering places of the dead,\" Prigozhin said. \"These are the guys who died yesterday due to the so-called 'shell starvation' [by the Russian MOD]. There should have been five times fewer of them. So mothers, wives and children will get their bodies.\"  ", "Apparently, the message got through to someone. In a message and voice note Thursday, Prigozhin said a shipment of ammunition was now on its way to his forces.    ", "\"Today at 6 am (local) it was reported that shipment of ammunition begins,\" he said. \"Most likely, the train has started moving ... we are told that the main papers have already been signed.\"   ", "What was the rationale behind this ghoulish spectacle? Prigozhin already has a reputation for callousness and cruelty: Late last year, around the New Year's holiday, he visited a morgue stacked with the body bags of dead Wagner soldiers, many of whom had been recruited from prisons with a promise of amnesty.   ", "\"Their contracts are over,\" he deadpanned. \"They're going home.\"  ", "But Prigozhin's latest stunt appeared to raise the ante in the oligarch's confrontation with Russia's defense establishment, and with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.   ", "Before Russia's February 24, 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Prigozhin was a shadowy figure. While the activities of Wagner were well documented - the mercenaries had appeared on battlefields in Syria and Libya as well as on training missions in the Central African Republic - the Russian government more or less denied its existence.   ", "All that changed after Russia's military suffered humiliating setbacks on the battlefield in Ukraine. Prigozhin - a canny political entrepreneur without any official government position - began openly taking credit for Wagner's efforts to secure some territorial gains, particularly in the battles raging around the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.  ", "He even began to acknowledge his role in Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election, admitting that he had founded the Internet Research Agency, the notorious St. Petersburg troll farm that the US government has sanctioned for interfering in American elections.   ", "His unexpected rise prompted speculation about possible elite infighting in Moscow as Russia's military campaign in Ukraine sputtered. One of Prigozhin's chief rivals has been Shoigu, who had clashed with the businessman over military contracts given to and then taken from one of the oligarch's enterprises.  ", "In one recent recording, Prigozhin railed against unnamed \"functionaries\" - a likely swipe against Shoigu - who \"have breakfast, lunch and dinner on golden dishes and send your daughters, granddaughters and whoevers to vacation in Dubai, showing no shame at all, at the very same time that Russian soldiers are dying at the front.\"   ", "Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has become a remote and isolated leader since the Covid-19 pandemic, has no clear successor, and some political insiders speculated that some opportunistic upstart - a Prigozhin, for instance - might sense a potential opening or chance to build a power base independent of Putin.   ", "Certainly, Prigozhin's outbursts would have been unthinkable before February 24, 2022, when open criticism of the defense leadership by a military contractor would not have been tolerated. Earlier this week, Prigozhin escalated his spat with Shoigu and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of Russia's General Staff, accusing them of \"treason\" for their alleged failures to support and supply the Wagner group in Ukraine.   ", "\"The Chief of the General Staff and the Minister of Defense are handing out commands right and left, that the Wagner PMC should not receive ammunition, they are also not helping with air transport,\" Prigozhin claimed in a recording posted by his press service on Telegram. \"This can be equated to high treason now when Wagner PMC are fighting for Bakhmut, losing hundreds of their fighters every day.\"  ", "Not everything Prigozhin says can be taken completely at face value. This is the man, after all, who helped bankroll one of Russia's most notorious disinformation campaigns. And the complaints about ammunition starvation leave unanswered myriad questions about the precise nature of the relationship of Wagner to the Russian military, how its formations are supplied with equipment, and who ultimately exercises command and control over its forces.   ", "In a recent report, Candace Rondeaux, the director of Future Frontlines at the Washington-based New America think tank observed, \"Despite perceptions of the Wagner Group as an independent paramilitary organization, Wagner's branding, communications, and operations are deeply intertwined with the Kremlin, President Vladimir Putin, Putin's oligarch allies, and the Russian military.\"  ", "And one of the unanswered questions remains how, exactly, Prigozhin manages to operate openly, when mercenary activity is technically proscribed by Russian law. The New America report says groups such as Wagner are part of a \"cartel-like structure\" that intertwines them with the Kremlin, Russia's power ministries, large state-owned companies, and Putin himself.  ", "\"Although Russian citizens are prohibited by law from serving as mercenaries in foreign wars, a small number of Russia's paramilitaries operate under a set of laws and executive decrees that allows them to provide services on contract to Russian state conglomerates that the Kremlin deems strategic in nature,\" Rondeaux wrote. \"These include Russia's state arms conglomerate Rostec as well as energy industry giants Gazprom, Tatneft, Rosneft, and Stroytrangaz.  ", "\"All five state-owned firms are headed by Putin's oldest friends from the days when he was a KGB agent. In effect, this schema allows Putin's closest inner circle, through frontmen like Prigozhin, to manage the cartel-like structure that constitutes what many think of today as the Wagner Group.\"  ", "Whether the Wagner frontman will retain his usefulness to Putin after such crude public criticism, then, remains to be seen. He's certainly shown little sign of dialing down his media campaign.  ", "On Thursday, Prigozhin posted a video greeting on his Telegram channel to mark the Defender of the Fatherland Day, a Russian national holiday. In the video, Prigozhin is shown a building in the distance that Wagner fighters claim to have taken close to downtown Bakhmut.

", "\"In our heart, Motherland and family is the same,\" Putin said to the crowd. \"The people standing here made a decision to defend the most sacred of what we have - family and Motherland.\"  ", "The concert that bookended Putin's appearance was a sort of pro-war Super Bowl halftime special, a fist-pumping version of the mass rallies of 20th century totalitarianism.   ", "The independent Russian Telegram channel SOTA reported that students had been corralled in dormitories to attend the rally; SOTA also posted a smartphone screenshot purportedly from the organizers of the concert that appeared to urge attendees to bring their friends.  ", "The rally had moments of extreme military kitsch, including an accordion ensemble playing \"333,\" a tune written by a Russian participant in the current war.   ", "It also played to World War II nostalgia. The Great Patriotic War, as it is known in Russia, is a touchstone for many Russians and a cause frequently invoked by Putin.

", "It also had a moment of cringe. The organizers ushered a group of children - described as children rescued from the Donbas region and the shattered Ukrainian city of Mariupol - and encouraged them to hug a uniformed man described as their rescuer.   ", "The images were particularly disturbing in the wake of a new report that the Russian government has been operating a network of camps where it has held thousands of Ukrainian children and undertaken a campaign of political re-education.  ", "But it was particularly ironic to see Kremlin-supporting artists performing a ghastly martial rendition of Gruppa Krovi, the classic anti-war song by Viktor Tsoi, a cult hero of the Soviet rock underground.  ", "Amid the carnage in Ukraine, the lines from the song are still relevant. \"Blood type on my sleeve / Serial number on my sleeve / Wish me luck in battle, wish / I'm not left lying in the grass.\"   ", "That, of course, was something left unmentioned in Putin's speech: The thousands - tens of thousands - of Russians left dead and maimed on Ukrainian soil.
