", "If and when Bakhmut falls, it may be tempting to ask whether Russian forces are improving, learning from the catalog of mistakes they have made so far in this conflict and finally exploiting their superiority in numbers and firepower.   ", "The answer: probably not.    ", "Mick Ryan, a former Australian general and author of the WarInTheFuture newsletter, says \"the Ukrainian Armed Forces might decide that they have achieved all they can by remaining in their defensive locations around Bakhmut, and that force preservation for the battles that follow is more important.\"   ", "But a Ukrainian withdrawal does not equal disaster if carried out in an orderly way. \"It should be treated as a routine tactic rather than a harbinger of disaster,\" Ryan says.   ", "The Ukrainians have used Bakhmut to inflict massive losses on the attacking force: by some estimates at a ratio of 7:1. There comes a moment when it is smarter to withdraw than suffer growing losses and the damaging blow to morale of seeing the surrender of hundreds and maybe thousands of surrounded Ukrainian soldiers.    ", "For the Ukrainians judging that moment is critical.   ", "But for the Russians, taking Bakhmut would not alter the fundamental shortcomings in their campaign.    ", "The battle for Bakhmut does suggest to some extent the Russians are changing their way of warfare, or at least trying to do so.   ", "They still rely on massive barrages of indirect fire (artillery and howitzers, rockets, aerial bombardment) to pulverize defensive positions. This was the tactic in the cities of Mariupol, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk last year. In short: leave nothing standing that can be defended.   ", "To recall the words of the Stalin-era Marshal Georgy Zhukov, \"The longer the battle lasts the more force we'll have to use.\"   ", "But such persistent fire demands an efficient logistics chain. Russian forces still struggle on that count.    ", "For sure, the end game in Mariupol and other cities taken last year ultimately involved men advancing street by street. But they were rarely Russian regulars, more often Chechen units, militia from the self-declared Luhansk and Donetsk Republics, and small numbers of Wagner operatives.    ", "And frequently they were moving into territory already abandoned.   ", "The campaign to take Soledar in January and now nearby Bakhmut has been out of the same playbook but with one notable and gruesome exception: the waves of infantry recruited by Yevgeny Prigozhin's Wagner Group sent to flood Ukrainian defenses.   ", "Prigozhin has acted unilaterally to shame the Russian military and burnish his own reputation. Wagner fighters taken prisoner by the Ukrainians told CNN they had next to no coordination with regular Russian forces, except for artillery support, as they were sent forward in their hundreds and thousands into the Ukrainian line of fire.   ", "Prigozhin bragged last week that if Wagner left Bakhmut, the front would fall.    ", "There are also signs that the Russians have used more infantry in their unsuccessful efforts to advance into Vuhledar, again with heavy losses.   ", "It's as if the Russians are bolting on rather than integrating a new dimension to their battle order: overwhelm Ukrainian defenses with wave after wave of cannon fodder - and accept casualty rates of up to 80% in the process.   ", "Such a devastating percentage of casualties is unsustainable along front lines extending thousands of kilometers. To some analysts, such losses mean \"the conditions are already present for a large-scale Russian military mutiny.\"   ", "Bakhmut has become an obsession for the Russians in the absence of progress elsewhere, far beyond any strategic rationale. Anxious that Prigozhin was taking the bouquets while it was taking the brickbats, the Russian Defense Ministry started pouring more forces into the area.    ", "But the focus on Bakhmut may have come at a cost to Russian operations elsewhere. Rather than a triumph of Russian generalship, the grinding campaign to take Bakhmut, first attacked some 10 months ago, illustrates the desperate need for a \"win\" - any win - regardless of the broader battlefield.    ", "That may explain why Ukrainian forces have been ordered to hold the line. Volodymyr Nazarenko, a deputy commander in the National Guard of Ukraine, said last week the Russians \"take no account of their losses in trying to take the city by assault. The task of our forces in Bakhmut is to inflict as many losses on the enemy as possible. Every meter of Ukrainian land costs hundreds of lives to the enemy.\"   ", "Russia's mobilization last autumn, recruiting some 300,000 men into uniform, provided a pool of foot soldiers and helped reconstitute units that had suffered heavy losses. At the same time, Prigozhin was scouring Russian prisons and converting his Wagner forces into the shock troops of the campaign.

", "But according to the Modern War Institute at West Point, \"Russia has been unable to prove it can effectively integrate new forces into damaged formations or build cohesive teams from ad hoc groupings of scattered unit remnants.\"     ", "Russia is now \"attempting to fight a costly, prolonged conflict with a pickup team of replacements while suffering from severe battlefield leadership attrition,\" the Institute assesses.   ", "But there are more systemic issues.    ", "The Ukraine conflict has seen Russian forces gradually trying to move away from reliance on Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs), combined arms formations that have proved ill-equipped for the Ukrainian conflict. Their Achilles heel: a lack of infantry and reconnaissance.   ", "The lack of each within BTGs in the advance toward Kyiv a year ago was one of the reasons the campaign stuttered and failed. Russian forces were vulnerable to ambush.    ", "That vulnerability has been aggravated by an ingrained culture that values obedience over initiative.   ", "In the words of a recent study by the European Council on Foreign Relations, \"The inadequate training and incompetence of Russian military personnel - combined with the strict hierarchies in which they operated, which left officers incapable of acting on their own initiative - meant that they were unable to quickly coordinate advances deep into enemy territory.\"   ", "As Rob Johnson wrote in the US Army War College Quarterly: \"Basic battle skills (such as alertness, logistics management, and moving tactically across the terrain to avoid casualties) were substandard, and evidence suggests a significant lack of discipline.\"   ", "Such deficiencies are not cured overnight. And retooling formations and structures in the midst of fighting a war is not ideal, but even less so when there is a shortage of competent mid-level commanders. The loss of colonels and lieutenant colonels adds to Russian troubles.   ", "Russia \"has responded to battlefield struggles in Ukraine by turning to its past model of fielding a large conscript force,\" says the Modern War Institute. \"In some ways this mirrors the tension between Russia's pursuit of a technologically sophisticated way of war and its longstanding bias for simple, rugged mass.\"  ", "That rugged mass has certainly inflicted severe losses on Ukrainian units in the past few months, and some Ukrainian commanders have questioned the wisdom of clinging on to both Soledar and Bakhmut.   ", "But even if the Russian flag is raised over the ruins of Bakhmut, it may turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory.   ", "As Mick Ryan writes: \"If the Russians do capture Bakhmut, they are seizing rubble. It is a town with minimal strategic importance, with almost no remaining infrastructure to support an occupying force.

However, right now getting Turkey on side is considered the priority.  ", "Unfortunately for the pro-NATO gang, Western officials are increasingly pessimistic that Turkey will budge.  ", "Officially, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan objects to Sweden and Finland's membership on what he claims are security grounds. Turkey claims that both countries, though particularly Sweden, are harboring militants from the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a designated terror group inTurkey, Sweden, the United States and Europe. Erdogan says he would like these individuals to be extradited; Sweden has made clear this won't happen.  ", "NATO diplomats are split on whether they think Turkey will budge before the July summit.

This is a good topic for him to bang his drum and a dramatic U-turn would only make him look weaker.\"  ", "Tol believes there are other reasons that Erdogan doesn't want to upsetRussia's President VladimirPutin.  ", "\"Russia has been a lifeline economically for Turkey after other nations imposed sanctions for their activities in Syria, their cooperation militarily with Russia and other hostile activity,\"Tol explains.\"Without Russian money, Erdogan would not have been able to raise wages or provide financial support to students. He is now promising mass rebuilding, post-earthquake. So Russia is still an attractive partner for Erdogan.\"  ", "Like many Western officials, Tol believes the Turkish claims about Sweden and Finland harboring terrorists provide perfect cover for Erdogan not to engage at a politically inconvenient time on the NATO question.  ", "While nothingmay come from the talksduebetween the three parties on Thursday, a conversation is taking place about how much political capital Erdogan might have to spend after the election, should he win.  ", "First, the optimists.  ", "This group includes Sweden, Finland and some of the states that border Russia or used to live under the Soviet sphere. They believe that Turkey, which benefits hugely from being part of NATO, will ultimately do what is in its best interest and drop objections.  ", "For this to happen, officials are bracing for Turkey to make more realistic demands than the handing over ofindividualsit deems to be terrorists,such as the lifting of sanctions or the US allowing Turkey to buy the fighter jets that the country badly needs to keep its air force up to date.  ", "Ultimately, the optimists believe there is a compromise that vastly favors NATO. The alliance, Sweden and Finland have made their case and NATO has an open-door policy for any country wanting to join. Sweden and Finland have more than met the criteria, so not joining makes a mockery of the alliance - an alliance that Turkey benefits from being a member. One NATO official told CNN that they assumed Erdogan would wait for the summit before conceding so that he can bask in the \"praise of all his Western allies.\"  ", "The far larger group among officials who spoke with CNN are pessimists. They think the chances of Erdogan shifting his position before July 11 are as good as zero and are already thinking beyond that summit.  ", "\"I think it's increasingly likely that Finland breaks from Sweden and goes for membership alone,\" one NATO diplomat told CNN.  ", "Other members of the alliance still see a real prospect of both countries being blocked and are considering how best NATO can handle such a scenario.  ", "Multiple NATO officials and diplomats told CNN that the danger here is Turkey's block feeding the Kremlin narrative that the West and NATO are divided. The alliance's job at that point will be to make clear that even if they are not members, Finland and Sweden are now effectively in lockstep with NATO. They might not be members, but they are as close partners as it's possible to be - and they are not neutral any more.  ", "Even if Turkey can be squared off, there is the separate, albeit less complicated issue of Hungary.  ", "Prime Minister Viktor Orban has publicly indicated he is not opposed to the Nordic nations joining, but keeps finding ways to stall a decision becoming official.  ", "There are a few reasons Orban would want to drag his feet. Finland and Sweden have both criticized Hungary for its rule of law record. He addressed this in a recent interview, asking how \"can anyone want to be our ally in a military system while they're shamelessly spreading lies about Hungary?\"  ", "Orban is considered to be the EU leader closest to Putin.Katalin Cseh, a Hungarian Member of the European Parliament, describes Orban's blocking of the Sweden and Finland bids as \"quite simply, another favor to Vladimir Putin.\" She believes that Orban, who has been accused of drifting towards autocratic leadership, has \"invested over a decade to copy his policies and build up a Putinist model,\" and that any perceived NATO victory over Putin \"puts his whole regime in jeopardy.\"  ", "It is possible that Orban is hanging on in order to get concessions from other EU member states, where Hungary has been accused of violating all manner of EU laws. The result has been withholding of EU funds and scorn from the bloc. While NATO and the EU are separate entities, they share many members and it is plausible that bilateral diplomacy could see some give-and-take between Hungary and its EU counterparts.  ", "For all Orban's foot-dragging, though, it is widely assumed that if Turkey can be squared off, Hungary will drop its opposition to Finland and Sweden joining NATO.  ", "The irony isn't lost on many that one of the main reasons Putin gave for invading Ukraine was to put a stop to what he claimed was NATO expansion. The fact that his aggression might have pushed a historically unaligned country into NATO is still seen by most in the West as a huge own goal by the Kremlin.  ", "Until an agreement is reached, however, the future of the alliance remains somewhat up in the air. Finland and Sweden have effectively picked a side since the start of the Ukraine conflict. It seems unlikely that they will return to a position of neutrality if the war were to suddenly end.  ", "The risk for NATO and the broader Western alliance comes if they fail to join the alliance at all and the Kremlin can use it for propaganda purposes.

But according to the Levada Center, a non-governmental polling organization, support dipped by only 6% among Russians from March to November last year, to 74%.   ", "In many respects, that is unsurprising. There is little room for dissenting voices on Russian airwaves; the propaganda beamed from state-controlled TV stations since the onset of war has at times attracted derision around the world, so overblown are their more fanatical presenters and pundits.  ", "In the days leading up to last Friday's one-year anniversary of the full-scale invasion - according to BBC Monitoring's Francis Scarr, who analyzes Russian media daily - a Russian MP told audiences on state-owned TV channel Russia-1 that \"if Kyiv needs to lie in ruins for our flag to fly above it, then so be it!\"; radio presenter Sergey Mardan proclaimed: \"There's only one peace formula for Ukraine: the liquidation of Ukraine as a state.\"  ", "And, in a farfetched statement that encapsulates the alternate reality in state TV channels exist, another pro-Russian former lawmaker claimed of Moscow's war progress: \"Everything is going to plan and everything is under control.\"   ", "Such programming typically appeals to a select group of older, more conservative Russians who pine for the days of the Soviet Union - though its reach spans generations, and it has claimed some converts.  ", "\"My opinion on Ukraine has changed,\" said Ekaterina, 37, who turns to popular Russian news program \"60 Minutes\" after getting home from work. \"At first my feelings were: what is the point of this war? Why did they take the decision to start it? It makes the lives of the people here in Russia much worse!\"   ", "The conflict has taken a personal toll on her. \"My life has deteriorated a lot in this year. Thankfully, no one close to me has been mobilized. But I lost my job. And I see radical changes around me everywhere,\" she said.  ", "And yet, Ekaterina's initial opposition to the invasion has disappeared. \"I arrived at the understanding that this special military operation was inevitable,\" she said. \"It would have come to this no matter what. And had we not acted first, war would have been unleashed against us,\" she added, mirroring the false claims of victimhood at the hands of the West that state media relentlessly communicate.   ", "Reversals like hers will be welcomed in the Kremlin as vindication of their notorious and draconian grip on media reporting.    ", "\"I trust the news there completely. Yes, they all belong to the state, (but) why should I not trust them?\" Yuliya, a 40-year-old HR director at a marketing firm, told CNN. \"I think (the war) is succeeding. Perhaps it is taking longer than one could wish for. But I think it is successful,\" said Yuliya, who said her main source of news is the state-owned Channel One.  ", "Around two-thirds of Russians rely primarily on television for their news, according to the Levada Center, a higher proportion than in most Western countries.  ", "But the sentiment of Yuliya and Ekaterina is far from universal. Even among those who generally support the war, Kremlin-controlled TV remains far removed from the reality many Russians live in.  ", "\"Everything I hear on state channels I split in half. I don't trust anyone (entirely),\" 55-year-old accountant Tatyana said. \"One needs to analyze everything ... because certain things they are omitting, (or) not saying,\" said Leonid, a 58-year-old engineer.  ", "Several people whom CNN spoke with in Moscow this month relayed similar feelings, stressing that they engaged with state-controlled TV but treated it with skepticism. And many reach different views on Ukraine.  ", "\"I think you can trust them all only to an extent. The state channels sometimes reflect the truth, but on other occasions they say things just to calm people down,\" 20-year-old Daniil said.  ", "Vocal minorities on each side of the conflict exist in Russia, and some have cut off friendships or left the country as a result. But sociologists tracking Russian opinion say most people in the country fall between those two extremes.  ", "\"Quite often we are only talking about these high numbers of support (for the war),\" Denis Volkov, the director of the Moscow-based Levada Center, said. \"But it's not that all these people are happy about it. They support their side, (but) would rather have it finished and fighting stopped.\"  ", "This group of people tends to pay less attention to the war, according to Natalia Savelyeva, a Future Russia Fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) who has interviewed hundreds of Russians since the invasion to trace the levels of public support for the conflict. \"We call them 'doubters,'\" she said.  ", "\"A lot of doubters don't go very deep into the news ... many of them don't believe that Russian soldiers kill Ukrainians - they repeat this narrative they see on TV,\" she said.   ", "The center ground also includes many Russians who have developed concerns about the war. But if the Kremlin cannot expect all-out support across its populace, sociologists say it can at least rely on apathy.  ", "\"I try to avoid watching news on the special military operation because I start feeling bad about what's going on,\" Natalya added. \"So I don't watch.\"  ", "She is far from alone. \"The major attitude is not to watch (the news) closely, not to discuss it with colleagues or friends. Because what can you do about it?\" said Volkov. \"Whatever you say, whatever you want, the government will do what they want.\"  ", "That feeling of futility means anti-war protests in Russia are rare and noteworthy, a social contract that suits the Kremlin. \"People don't want to go and protest; first, because it might be dangerous, and second, because they see it as a futile enterprise,\" Volkov said.  ", "\"What are we supposed to do? Our opinion means diddly squat,\" a woman told CNN in Moscow in January, anonymously discussing the conflict.  ", "The bulk of the population typically disengages instead. \"In general, those people try to distance themselves from what's going on,\" Savelyeva added. \"They try to live their lives as though nothing is happening.\"  ", "And a culture of silence - re-enforced by heavy-handed authorities - keeps many from sharing skepticism about the conflict. A married couple in the southwestern Russian city of Krasnodar were reportedly arrested in January for professing anti-war sentiments during a private conversation in a restaurant, according to the independent Russian monitoring group OVD-Info.   ", "\"I do have an opinion about the special military operation ... it remains the same to this day,\" Anna told CNN in Moscow. \"I can't tell you which side I support. I am for truth and justice. Let's leave it like that,\" she said.  ", "Keeping the war at arm's length has, however, become more difficult over the course of the past year. Putin's chaotic partial mobilization order and Russia's increasing economic isolation has brought the conflict to the homes of Russians, and communication with friends and relatives in Ukraine often paint a different picture of the war than that reported by state media.  ", "\"I have felt anxious ever since this began. It's affecting (the) availability of products and prices,\" a woman who asked to remain anonymous told CNN last month. \"There is a lack of public information. People should be explained things. Everyone is listening to Soloviev,\" she said, referring to prominent propagandist Vladimir Soloviev.   ", "\"It would be good if the experts started expressing their real opinions instead of obeying orders, from the government and Putin,\" the woman said.   ", "A film student, who said she hadn't heard from a friend for two months following his mobilization, added: \"I don't know what's happened to him. It would be nice if he just responded and said 'OK, I'm alive.'\"  ", "\"I just wish this special military operation never started in the first place - this war - and that human life was really valued,\" she said.  ", "For those working to break through the Kremlin's information blockade, Russia's quiet majority is a key target.  ", "Most Russians see on state media a \"perverted picture of Russia battling the possible invasion of their own territory - they don't see their compatriots dying,\" said Kiryl Sukhotski, who oversees Russian-language content at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the US Congress-funded media outlet that broadcasts in countries where information is controlled by state authorities.  ", "\"That's where we come in,\" Sukhotski said.  ", "The outlet is one of the most influential platforms bringing uncensored scenes from the Ukrainian frontlines into Russian-speaking homes, primarily through digital platforms still allowed by the Kremlin including YouTube, Telegram and WhatsApp.  ", "And interest has surged throughout the war, the network says. \"We saw traffic spikes after the mobilization, and after the Ukrainian counter-offensives, because people started to understand what (the war) means for their own communities and they couldn't get it from local media.\"  ", "Current Time, its 24/7 TV and digital network for Russians, saw a two-and-a-half-fold increase in Facebook views, and more than a three-fold rise in YouTube views, in the 10 months following the invasion, RFE/RL told CNN. Last year, QR codes which directed smartphone users to the outlet's website started popping up in Russian cities, which RFE/RL believed were stuck on lampposts and street signs by anti-war citizens.  ", "But independent outlets face a challenge reaching beyond internet natives, who tend to be younger and living in cities, and penetrating the media diet of older, poorer and rural Russians, who are typically more conservative and supportive of the war.   ", "\"We need to get to the wider audience in Russia,\" Sukhotski said. \"We see a lot of people indoctrinated by Russian state propaganda ... it will be an uphill battle but this is where we shape our strategy.\"  ", "Reaching Russians at all has not been easy. Most of RFE/RL's Russia-based staff made a frantic exit from the country after the invasion, following the Kremlin's crackdown on independent outlets last year, relocating to the network's headquarters in Prague.   ", "The same fate befell outlets like BBC Russia and Latvia-based Meduza, which were also targeted by the state.  ", "A new law made it a crime to disseminate \"fake\" information about the invasion of Ukraine - a definition decided at the whim of the Kremlin - with a penalty of up to 15 years in prison for anyone convicted. This month, a Russian court sentenced journalist Maria Ponomarenko to six years in prison for a Telegram post that the court said spread supposedly \"false information\" about a Russian airstrike on a theater in Mariupol, Ukraine, that killed hundreds, state news agency TASS reported.  ", "\"All our staff understand they can't go back to Russia,\" Sukhotski told CNN. \"They still have families there. They still have ailing parents there. We have people who were not able to go to their parents' funerals in the past year.\"  ", "His staff are \"still coming to terms with that,\" Sukhotski admitted. \"They are Russian patriots and they wish Russia well ... they see how they can help.\"  ", "Outlets like RFE/RL have openings across the digital landscape, in spite of Russia's move to ban Twitter, Facebook and other Western platforms last year.  ", "About a quarter of Russians use VPN services to access blocked sites, according to a Levada Center poll carried out two months after Russia's invasion.   ", "Searches for such services on Google spiked to record levels in Russia following the invasion, and have remained at their highest rates in over a decade ever since, the search engine's tracking data shows.   ", "YouTube meanwhile remains one of the few major global sites still accessible, thanks to its huge popularity in Russia and its value in spreading Kremlin propaganda videos.  ", "\"YouTube became the television substitute for Russia ... the Kremlin fear that if they don't have YouTube, they won't be able to control the flow of information to (younger people),\" Sukhotski said.  ", "And that allows censored organizations a way in. \"I watch YouTube. I watch everything there - I mean everything,\" one Moscow resident who passionately opposes the war told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"These federal channels I never watch,\" she said. \"I don't trust a word they say. They lie all the time! You've just got to switch on your logic, compare some information and you will see that it's all a lie.\"  ", "Telegram, meanwhile, has spiked in popularity since the war began, becoming a public square for military bloggers to analyze each day on the battlefield.  ", "At first, that analysis tended to mirror the Kremlin's line. But \"starting around September, when Ukraine launched their successful counter-offensives, everything started falling apart,\" said Olga Lautman, a US-based Senior Fellow at CEPA who studies the Kremlin's internal affairs and propaganda tactics. \"I've never seen anything like it,\" she said.  ", "Scores of hawkish bloggers, some of whom boast hundreds of thousands of followers, have strayed angrily from the Kremlin's line in recent months, lambasting its military tactics and publicly losing faith in the armed forces' high command.  ", "This month, a debacle in Vuhledar that saw Russian tanks veer wildly into minefields became the latest episode to expose those fissures. The former Defense Minister of the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic, Igor Girkin, sometimes known by his nom de guerre Igor Strelkov - now a  a strident critic of the campaign - said Russian troops \"were shot like turkeys at a shooting range.\" In another post, he called Russian forces \"morons.\" Several Russian commentators called for the dismissal of Lieutenant General Rustam Muradov, the commander of the Eastern Grouping of Forces.   ", "\"This public fighting is spilling over,\" Lautman told CNN. \"Russia has lost control of the narrative ... it has normally relied on having a smooth propaganda machine and that no longer exists.\"  ", "One year into an invasion that most Russians initially thought would last days, creaks in the Kremlin's control of information are showing.  ", "The impact of those fractures remains unclear. For now, Putin can rely on a citizenry that is generally either supportive of the conflict or too fatigued to proclaim its opposition.  ", "But some onlookers believe the pendulum of public opinion is slowly swinging away from the Kremlin.   ", "\"One family doesn't know of another family who hasn't suffered a loss in Ukraine,\" Lautman said. \"Russians do support the conflict because they do have an imperialistic ambition.

", "\"I remember my wedding ceremony and that feeling of not knowing anything. That unpredictable and really scary future,\" Arieva said.  ", "The same day, they collected their weapons and signed up as volunteers with their local unit of territorial defense force, the volunteer branch of Ukraine's armed forces, determined to defend their city. Arieva serves as an elected Kyiv City councilor, a part-time unpaid government position that meant she was given a weapon.  ", "Fursin was immediately sent toward the front lines. He told CNN he saw a bus full of volunteers and simply jumped in, unsure where it was headed.  ", "He and other volunteers were forming the second line of defense north of Kyiv, in Irpin, Hostomel and other areas that quickly became key battlegrounds.   ", "\"The first night, we were totally not ready. We didn't have any trenches, nothing,\" he said.  ", "Fursin was put in charge of a group of 10 people, mostly other very young men. His qualifications? He was the only one of the 11 who had held an automatic weapon before.  ", "\"The commander watched how I handled the weapon and said: 'Take these people and make shelters and ambush positions and think about which way you will run,'\" Fursin related. \"We were digging trenches. Just digging, digging, digging, all night.\"   ", "Arieva, meanwhile, was back at the base of their territorial defense unit in Kyiv, trying to be helpful.  ", "\"The first night when I was waiting for my husband, when he left for his first battle, I think it was the scariest night of my life, because of course, I couldn't call him because he had to turn his phone off,\" she said.  ", "\"I wasn't religious but at that moment I prayed to all [the] gods I know for him to come back safe.\"  ", "The next month and a half is a blur.  ", "Fursin kept going on missions. He was mostly manning checkpoints and forming a second line of defense, but he did find himself face-to-face with Russian troops a couple of times and was trained in firing anti-tank missiles. He refuses to go into details beyond saying he had used his weapons during that time. \"We were told not to talk about it,\" he said.  ", "Arieva, meanwhile, was working in a tiny office with eight other people, 7 a.m. until 10 p.m. every day. There were three small tables with barely enough space for the computers, let alone the people. Bounty and Snickers bars, cigarettes and tobacco sticks became hard currency during that time.  ", "They both admit the experience was a tough one.   ", "\"In our dreams, when we were imagining it, we were so heroic and strong. And the reality was that we washed once a week because there were no showers in there and it wasn't very pleasant, [with] the lack of sleep and sometimes food,\" she said.   ", "Still, they look back at the time with pride and fondness.  ", "\"Everyone forgot who they are, if they were very famous or very, very rich or very [influential] politicians, they were just helping each other, standing together smoking and not knowing what was going on,\" Arieva said.  ", "Arieva said she quit smoking just days before the war began, but her determination didn't last.  ", "\"I said I will quit on victory day, but I might have to try earlier,\" she said.  ", "When Russian troops withdrew from the Kyiv region in early April, Arieva and Fursin's time in the territorial defense came to an end. The military decided it needed to make the volunteer units more professional and only those with previous military experience were allowed to stay.  ", "Fursin and Arieva were asked to leave the force.  ", "\"It was hard to become civilians again, because we didn't want to be protected, we wanted to do something,\" she said.  ", "They tried to enjoy the small things, like the first cappuccino since the start of the war.  ", "\"It was the tastiest thing. That cappuccino with the foam, that beauty, that taste, it [the war] has really made us value things much more,\" she said.  ", "For Fursin, last year's invasion was the second of his life. He grew up in Crimea and was living on the Ukrainian peninsula when Russia forcibly annexed it in 2014. His grandmother was too ill to travel at the time, so they stayed.  ", "\"I remember how the place has changed after that. We used to joke that you go to sleep in one country and wake up in another,\" he said.  ", "When Fursin's family finally left Crimea, they settled in Irpin. Just three years later, their home was, once again, invaded by Russian troops.  ", "The couple describes the shock of coming back to Irpin after it was liberated in early April. The town north of Kyiv became the front line during the battle for the capital city. It was here that Ukrainian forces managed to repel the attack.    ", "The family home was still standing, but was severely damaged, with windows shattered and half of the building scorched.   ", "Back in the civilian world, the couple began volunteering, bringing food and basic supplies to liberated settlements north of Kyiv. The demand was so overwhelming that sometimes they had to make multiple trips a day.  ", "\"I remember Katyuzhanka, because we brought a lot of bread and macaroni and some pasta sauce and batteries and there was a huge amount of people waiting. We gave out everything we had and we had to go back and bring more bread because more than half [of the] people didn't get anything and they didn't have a slice of bread in that town,\" Arieva said.   ", "She still remembers people sharing terrifying stories of life under occupation and bursting into tears upon hearing strangers speak Ukrainian.  ", "\"It was really ... hard to even listen to these stories, it hurts,\" she said.   ", "Slowly, life started to return to normal. It was spring, and Kyiv was in full bloom. It really felt like renewal, they said.   ", "They had their official town hall wedding and a small celebration in May, mostly because the deposit was paid and non-refundable. Arieva finally got to introduce her husband to her 97-year-old great-grandmother.   ", "They had both lost their jobs right at the beginning of the invasion. Arieva was working for the Committee of Voters of Ukraine, an observer organization, and Fursin for a housing co-op in Irpin.   ", "As they started running out of money, they decided to focus on work and their studies.   ", "Over the summer, Fursin finally graduated from university. He began his degree in Crimea, but when his family fled the occupied peninsula in 2019, he had to start over. He is now working on and off on software development projects.  ", "Arieva, meanwhile, decided to focus on learning to code. Tech is the only sector that is still growing in Ukraine, because it allows people to work remotely.   ", "But their plan to work and study remotely got derailed when Russia launched a wave of attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in the fall. Working was quickly becoming impossible.  ", "\"We would have two hours of electricity, then five hours without electricity, then three hours of electricity, it was really demoralizing,\" Arieva said.  ", "\"The worst thing about that was that the streets weren't lit. And not all people use their torches or have [reflective] jackets to be seen on the road. And every week I would see a car crash from my balcony and some people died,\" she added.  ", "In the fall, they adopted a cat and called him Kus, Ukrainian for \"bite.\" Even now, months later, Fursin's arms are covered in cat scratches.  ", "As Christmas started approaching, the couple, along with their families, decided to switch the date they'd celebrate the Christmas holiday.  ", "Instead of January 7, which marks the birth of Jesus according to the Julian calendar, still used by the Russian Orthodox Church, they celebrated on December 24, which marks the birth of Jesus according to the Gregorian calendar.  ", "\"So we had two Christmases in 2022,\" Arieva said.  ", "Ukraine's Orthodox church announced in the fall that it would allow its churches to celebrate Christmas in December.  ", "\"It makes more sense. It was more symbolic and I really liked it. And also it feels good that we are not celebrating with Russians anymore,\" Arieva said.  ", "The family didn't have the usual full spread of 12 dishes for Christmas dinner, because the electricity was on for just six hours that day. They cooked Kutia, the traditional Ukrainian porridge-like Christmas meal that consists of wheat or rice, raisins, walnuts, honey and poppy seeds, using the emergency gas cylinder.  ", "As the first anniversary of the war - and their wedding - approaches, Arieva and Fursin are reflecting on how the year has changed them.   ", "Arieva said she is a completely different person. \"I became less naive and less childish. And maybe it has made me a little bit stronger. Because what doesn't kill us, makes us stronger, of course,\" she said.   ", "\"Only when you see this, you understand the value of life. And for me, this is 100%,\" Fursin said. \"What we went through together, I understand that [we are] completely different. And that we [continue] to love each other, that, for me, is maybe the biggest sign that it's true love,\" he said.   "], "headline": "They got married the day Russia invaded.

", "Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine served as the unwitting antidote to six years of clumsy populism and the huge economic and psychological shock of the pandemic. It also worked to counter a sense that morality, and the virtue of values, were becoming obsolete in the face of the many challenges posed by the world's crises.  ", "It shouldn't have taken the deaths of thousands of innocent Ukrainians, the threat of nuclear attack, and the leveling of so much of a country, to make this point. But it's perhaps the revulsion to Putin's brutal and inept war that helped Europe and the rest of the West rediscover a collective sense of purpose.  ", "The eyes of three old men thrust into our van in Posad Pokhrovka, in the early days of the war, desperate to flee shelling that had torn their world apart, still haunt me: Not even the Nazis beat them like that, they said, sobbing. They never thought they'd live long enough to see worse than the 1940s.  ", "Wars can intensify scrutiny of both sides' conduct to the point where each can be accused of some degree of wrongdoing. So, it's important to pause at this point and consider the ugliness of the way Russia has waged this war.  ", "Firstly, Moscow won't even admit that it's at war - a sign of the fictional landscape in which it wishes to fight.  ", "Secondly, Moscow has burned through its professional army so fast, it is press-ganging students to the front, and resorting to unleashing human waves of Russian prisoners at Ukrainian trenches. Some return in coffins, the injured are sent back to fight.    ", "Thirdly, the lack of sophistication - or even basic self-awareness - is striking. The Russian high command doesn't even seem to want to address how bad it is. In the background, the threat of nuclear force has been brandished so ineptly - in chest-pounding signals from a weak Kremlin which is losing the most conventional of fights - it appears to have had the almost opposite effect, galvanizing the West into concerted action in the face of what amounts to nuclear blackmail.  ", "Ukraine's response has been further fuel to Western unity. Ingenuity has bolstered the Ukrainians' defense. A territorial defense fighter, known as \"Graf,\" could talk in Kramatorsk for hours about the complexities of syncing drone surveillance to artillery, then switch to the role of Western private contractors in the war, and end with a blistering critique on the role alcoholism and corruption would have on the bones of Russia's nuclear program.  ", "Ukraine is sending its best and brightest to fight, and adapting to warfare faster than imaginable, while Russia is forcing convicts to run straight into the hail of bullets from Kyiv's machine guns.  ", "In the past year, fear of Moscow has begun to evaporate. The Cold War foe that could vaporize our world - whose warheads were the menace behind so many childhood animations and movies in the 80s - has not recovered and lost the internal blindness and shoddiness that led to the Soviet collapse. It's as bad as it was, only more desperate - its elite twice-humiliated, first in the 90s, and now.  ", "The Russian dead I witnessed, sprawled all over the roadside as Ukraine advanced in Kherson this summer, were scruffy, with a sleeping mat and workout gloves for comfort, and only rusting armor at their backs.   ", "There is something tragic about how fast Russia has fallen. Deservedly so, perhaps, but pause also to remember that the first Putin years contained, despite their massacres in Chechnya and slow strangulation of dissent, a kernel of economic reform and progress for ordinary Russians. Putin was creating the middle class that would ultimately risk his downfall.  ", "Now all that is gone, and a shrinking population will rasp on the edges of Europe for years to come. Whether Russia requires a harsh reprimand or not, the impact of its demise will be another problem Europe has to endure up close.   ", "What's most startling about the choice Moscow has imposed on the West - to seek its strategic defeat in Ukraine rather than its limited appeasement - is that Europe was heading in the other direction a year ago.  ", "Defense budgets were growing in recognition of Russian malice, but the broad hope was that Putin would be a benign, grumpy neighbor arguing over the border fence, rather than a savage marauder bent on restoring an empire so aged in concept not even he was old enough to have seen it in full.  ", "The West is engaged in an act of full-throated support of Ukraine that it's fair to say most of its officials would have deemed far too provocative a year ago. Sending tanks, thinking of F16s, training troops... It's hard to argue this isn't already NATO's war too, fought by proxy.  ", "Is that a bad thing? For Ukraine, yes, whose sacrifice should never have had to happen. So much loss remains hidden: I recall being inside and shivering outside the administration building of Mykolaiv at the start of the war. Now all I can think of is how many must have been inside it when a missile tore it in two in March.  ", "But this is a more limited scenario for Russia's defeat than NATO war planners could have gamed. The Great Power was never meant to falter so explicitly, or so ineptly inspire unity in the foes it had worked so hard to divide.   ", "A pattern of miscalculation and misstep by Moscow is not entirely comforting. It leaves the use of its nuclear arsenal as something of a wild card still. We know the consequences of nuclear weapons use for their victims and ordinary Russians. But that's not stopped Putin up to now.   ", "The possibility Russia's nastiest toys also fail in their most destructive use - that the nuclear button just smokes and whirrs when struck - is perhaps what is holding Putin back, or the same streak of self-preservation that has guided his every move.   ", "It is perhaps the innate selfishness and myopia of Russia's system that reduces this threat and has enabled such a meaty Western response. The year ahead will likely see the non-conventional menace of a desperate Russia grow, and the slow tiring of Western support, as elections churn and budgets are strained.  ", "But a wider victory has already been achieved in a year - in that unity of purpose and substance of support have prevailed, where Moscow sought to seek selfishness and division.
