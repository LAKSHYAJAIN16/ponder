Historically, both countrieshad committed to non-alignment with NATO as a way of avoidingprovokingMoscow. The invasion of Ukraine changed that.  ", "Both Finland and Sweden - along with the vast majority of NATO allies - would like to see the countries formally join the alliance at a NATO summit on July 11. However, a significant hurdle stands in the way of this becoming a reality: Turkey has yet to give the plan itsformal and officialblessing.  ", "Turkey is not the only nation blocking the move: Hungary has also failed to ratify the Nordics' accession which further muddies the waters. However, right now getting Turkey on side is considered the priority.  ", "Unfortunately for the pro-NATO gang, Western officials are increasingly pessimistic that Turkey will budge.  ", "Officially, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan objects to Sweden and Finland's membership on what he claims are security grounds. Turkey claims that both countries, though particularly Sweden, are harboring militants from the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a designated terror group inTurkey, Sweden, the United States and Europe. Erdogan says he would like these individuals to be extradited; Sweden has made clear this won't happen.  ", "NATO diplomats are split on whether they think Turkey will budge before the July summit. Central to both schools of thought isthis year'sTurkish election, perceived as the biggest political threat Erdogan has faced in years.  ", "\"The image he has created of a strongman who gets results for the Turkish people has been shattered,\" explains Gonul Tol of the Middle East Institute's Turkey program. \"There is a lot of anti-West and anti-Kurd sentiment in Turkey at the moment. This is a good topic for him to bang his drum and a dramatic U-turn would only make him look weaker.\"  ", "Tol believes there are other reasons that Erdogan doesn't want to upsetRussia's President VladimirPutin.  ", "\"Russia has been a lifeline economically for Turkey after other nations imposed sanctions for their activities in Syria, their cooperation militarily with Russia and other hostile activity,\"Tol explains.\"Without Russian money, Erdogan would not have been able to raise wages or provide financial support to students. He is now promising mass rebuilding, post-earthquake. So Russia is still an attractive partner for Erdogan.\"  ", "Like many Western officials, Tol believes the Turkish claims about Sweden and Finland harboring terrorists provide perfect cover for Erdogan not to engage at a politically inconvenient time on the NATO question.  ", "While nothingmay come from the talksduebetween the three parties on Thursday, a conversation is taking place about how much political capital Erdogan might have to spend after the election, should he win.  ", "First, the optimists.  ", "This group includes Sweden, Finland and some of the states that border Russia or used to live under the Soviet sphere. They believe that Turkey, which benefits hugely from being part of NATO, will ultimately do what is in its best interest and drop objections.  ", "For this to happen, officials are bracing for Turkey to make more realistic demands than the handing over ofindividualsit deems to be terrorists,such as the lifting of sanctions or the US allowing Turkey to buy the fighter jets that the country badly needs to keep its air force up to date.  ", "Ultimately, the optimists believe there is a compromise that vastly favors NATO. The alliance, Sweden and Finland have made their case and NATO has an open-door policy for any country wanting to join. Sweden and Finland have more than met the criteria, so not joining makes a mockery of the alliance - an alliance that Turkey benefits from being a member. One NATO official told CNN that they assumed Erdogan would wait for the summit before conceding so that he can bask in the \"praise of all his Western allies.\"  ", "The far larger group among officials who spoke with CNN are pessimists. They think the chances of Erdogan shifting his position before July 11 are as good as zero and are already thinking beyond that summit.  ", "\"I think it's increasingly likely that Finland breaks from Sweden and goes for membership alone,\" one NATO diplomat told CNN.  ", "Other members of the alliance still see a real prospect of both countries being blocked and are considering how best NATO can handle such a scenario.  ", "Multiple NATO officials and diplomats told CNN that the danger here is Turkey's block feeding the Kremlin narrative that the West and NATO are divided. The alliance's job at that point will be to make clear that even if they are not members, Finland and Sweden are now effectively in lockstep with NATO. They might not be members, but they are as close partners as it's possible to be - and they are not neutral any more.  ", "Even if Turkey can be squared off, there is the separate, albeit less complicated issue of Hungary.  ", "Prime Minister Viktor Orban has publicly indicated he is not opposed to the Nordic nations joining, but keeps finding ways to stall a decision becoming official.  ", "There are a few reasons Orban would want to drag his feet. Finland and Sweden have both criticized Hungary for its rule of law record. He addressed this in a recent interview, asking how \"can anyone want to be our ally in a military system while they're shamelessly spreading lies about Hungary?\"  ", "Orban is considered to be the EU leader closest to Putin.Katalin Cseh, a Hungarian Member of the European Parliament, describes Orban's blocking of the Sweden and Finland bids as \"quite simply, another favor to Vladimir Putin.\" She believes that Orban, who has been accused of drifting towards autocratic leadership, has \"invested over a decade to copy his policies and build up a Putinist model,\" and that any perceived NATO victory over Putin \"puts his whole regime in jeopardy.\"  ", "It is possible that Orban is hanging on in order to get concessions from other EU member states, where Hungary has been accused of violating all manner of EU laws. The result has been withholding of EU funds and scorn from the bloc. While NATO and the EU are separate entities, they share many members and it is plausible that bilateral diplomacy could see some give-and-take between Hungary and its EU counterparts.  ", "For all Orban's foot-dragging, though, it is widely assumed that if Turkey can be squared off, Hungary will drop its opposition to Finland and Sweden joining NATO.  ", "The irony isn't lost on many that one of the main reasons Putin gave for invading Ukraine was to put a stop to what he claimed was NATO expansion. The fact that his aggression might have pushed a historically unaligned country into NATO is still seen by most in the West as a huge own goal by the Kremlin.  ", "Until an agreement is reached, however, the future of the alliance remains somewhat up in the air. Finland and Sweden have effectively picked a side since the start of the Ukraine conflict. It seems unlikely that they will return to a position of neutrality if the war were to suddenly end.  ", "The risk for NATO and the broader Western alliance comes if they fail to join the alliance at all and the Kremlin can use it for propaganda purposes. If that happens, even if the war suddenly ends, the narrative of a divided West will continue to be the drum that NATO's opponents can bang.  "], "headline": "Turkey is blocking NATO's expansion.

While there have been incremental Russian gains around Bakhmut (at great cost), and a substantial escalation in Russian artillery, tank and aviation assaults in many areas, much of the long frontline is as it was three months ago.

", "The video released by the Defense Ministry showed Shoigu at a meeting with three senior officers involved in the conflict:  Colonel Generals Mikhail Mizintsev, Sergei Rudskoy, and Rustam Muradov. This is probably intended to show that the Defense Ministry is firmly in control of the operation, despite Prigozhin's comments.   ", "But it's somewhat puzzling that the man directly in charge of the whole operation - Valery Gerasimov - did not appear to be part of this well-choreographed visit.   ", "Muradov's presence is notable. The commander of the Eastern Military District, he has been frequently criticized by Russian military bloggers and even units under his command for tactics that have led to heavy casualties, especially around the town of Vuhledar, where Russian forces suffered catastrophic losses in January.

The explosion destroyed an outpatient clinic and some critical equipment, while the blast wave ripped through the rest of the hospital buildings, shattering windows and knocking out doors.  ", "Several patients were undergoing surgery and a number of women were in a labor ward at the time, Bashtanka Hospital director Alla Barsehian told CNN last week.  ", "All patients were safely evacuated, but health care workers turned up to work the next morning. In the rain, shoulder to shoulder with their friends and family, they began cleaning up the debris by hand. One and a half days later - with plastic wrap for windows and no doors - the facility reopened.  ", "\"We are the lifeblood of this district,\" Barsehian said. She told CNN when she returned to the destroyed buildings the day after the attack, patients approached her and asked when the next appointment for their doctor was available - this is when she realized they had no choice but to carry on. \"We didn't have time [to deliberate], we had to quickly restore everything and continue doing our jobs because people needed us.\"  ", "The explosion in Bashtanka came just over a month after a similar attack destroyed Mariupol maternal hospital in March 2022. Russian officials then claimed that the hospital was a justifiable military target, but a pattern was emerging.  ", "More than 250 attacks during Russia's invasion last year left nearly one in 10 Ukrainian hospitals damaged, some repeatedly, according to new analysis reviewed by CNN by investigators from the United States, United Kingdom, Switzerland and Ukraine published Tuesday.  ", "The analysis is a joint undertaking of five different non-governmental organizations (NGOs): eyeWitness to Atrocities (eyeWitness), Insecurity Insight, the Media Initiative for Human Rights (MIHR), Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), and the Ukrainian Healthcare Center (UHC). CNN has reviewed their analysis but cannot independently confirm the details of each attack.  ", "Nearly 200 medical workers, who at the time of war are protected under international human rights laws, were either killed, injured, kidnapped or arrested, the collaboration between the NGOs revealed.  ", "Researchers documented 707 health care attacks between February and December 2022, including damage to facilities, such as strikes by ground-launched explosives, and other attacks, such as looting, denial of access to health care and disruption of patients' access to utilities necessary for medical care.  ", "\"These findings should be a wake-up call for the global community to act now to end impunity for wanton violence against health workers, in Ukraine and around the world,\" Christian De Vos, report co-author and research director at Physicians for Human Rights, a US-based human rights NGO, told CNN.  ", "\"While violence against health care in conflict zones is a global phenomenon, Russia's assault on Ukraine's health system in 2022 stands out for its scale and indiscriminate violence against civilian infrastructure,\" said Christina Wille, report co-author and director of Insecurity Insight, a Swiss non-profit organization monitoring threats of violence across the globe.  ", "\"We have clearly seen from the pattern [in the data] a method of warfare which is incompatible with the respect for international humanitarian law and needs to be addressed,\" Wille told CNN, referring to incidents of indiscriminate use of explosive weapons against Ukraine listed in the report and alleged cases of kidnapping and torture of individual health workers.  ", "CNN has asked the Russian government for comment but has not yet received a response. Russia has previously claimed that it only fires on targets of military value. Following the 2022 attack at the Mariupol maternity and children's hospital, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed - without providing evidence -  that Ukrainian forces had \"equipped combat positions\" within the hospital. Video from the hospital after the bombing clearly showed there were both patients and staff there, including heavily pregnant women who were carried from the hospital.  ", "Nearly a year into the war, Russia is mounting enormous pressure on Ukrainian civilians by using explosive weapons in urban areas, and damaging crucial services, such as the energy grid and the health care system.  ", "Nearly one in three Ukrainians lack access to medical services - and that number is greater in the eastern and southern parts of the country - according to a December 2022 survey by the United Nations' International Organization for Migration.  ", "\"These are vulnerable populations of people that need to have access to health care. And right now, it's severely jeopardized,\" Dr. David Callaway said, an emergency medicine physician who has provided aid in Ukraine and serves as chief medical officer of the disaster response nonprofit Team Rubicon.  ", "Experts warn that civilians are left with hardly any access to medical care in areas that have seen active combat. Nearly 80% of Mariupol's health care facilities are destroyed, leaving the city's remaining population of 100,000, many of them vulnerable or elderly, practically on their own, according to previous research by the Ukrainian Healthcare Center (UHC) think tank, one of the report partners. By June last year, at least 320,000 Mariupol citizens have either fled, been forcibly relocated or died, according to Mariupol's City Council.  ", "\"An implicit loss of health [in Ukraine] is vast,\" said Pavlo Kovtoniuk, UHC co-founder and Ukraine's former Deputy Minister of Health. \"We see a huge deprivation of health care services and pharmaceuticals in recently de-occupied territories.\"  ", "Callaway said the attacks also have a \"chilling effect\" on health care workers who want to \"provide care and abide by their principles of impartiality and neutrality to help those in need. When they're intentionally targeted, that has a significant impact on the ability of humanitarians to work.\"  ", "But even away from the frontline, small to medium communities are feeling the effects of the attacks on their health care facilities and workers. Like Bashtanka, they are normally served by just one hospital or clinic, Kovtoniuk said, adding that disruptions result in people dropping their medication for chronic conditions, stopping health checkups or suffering from mental health issues alone, the consequences of which will only be seen in years to come.  ", "\"Russian attacks have an impact that exists long after the physical damage to a building; lack of access to necessary care and essential medicines destabilizes the population at large,\" De Vos told CNN. \"I think that is precisely why the health care is often targeted.\"  ", "Kovtoniuk's team and their colleagues at the Media Initiative for Human Rights (MIHR) traveled across Ukraine in the last year to visit attack sites, assess damage and interview victims. They used specialized software designed by UK-based eyeWitness to Atrocities, another report partner, to document what happened on the ground in a way that could be submitted as legal evidence in national and international criminal cases related to the war.  ", "For locations that were impossible to reach due to combat or occupation, a group of Ukrainian and international investigators gathered social media reports and checked them against satellite imagery to verify that the events actually took place, Kovtoniuk said.  ", "\"The report is the very first comprehensive effort to map and analyze attacks on Ukrainian health care infrastructure and personnel by Russian forces,\" said Iryna Marchuk, an associate professor of international and criminal law at the University of Copenhagen, who was not part of the research.  ", "\"The health care infrastructure in Ukraine has been deliberately targeted by Russian forces, which is absolutely prohibited in international humanitarian law and constitutes a war crime falling within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court,\" Marchuk said in an emailed statement last week.  ", "The Geneva Conventions qualify indiscriminate bombing in populated areas, failure to distinguish between combatants and civilians, and intentionally directing attacks against distinctively marked medical units, transport, and personnel as war crimes. The United Nations considers deliberate, strategic targeting of civilian populations a crime against humanity.  ", "The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains its own database of attacks on health care facilities, transport, supplies and personnel in Ukraine. WHO counted 774 attacks from the start of Russia's invasion through the end of 2022, with 101 deaths and 131 injuries of medical personnel and other civilians on the ground. However, it does not disclose precise details of the attacks in this database.  ", "The coalition of investigators from the UHC, MIHR, PHR, Insecurity Insight and eyeWitness is urging the international legal community to investigate the evidence it gathered.  ", "\"When Russia entered the war in Syria in 2015, it used the same tactic, but it was never held accountable for that, so it decided to use it again in Ukraine,\" Kovtoniuk told CNN.  ", "Richard Goldstone, former justice of the Constitutional Court of South Africa who was instrumental in helping end apartheid in South Africa, said he found the report to be damning. \"I anticipate that it will assist in bringing some of the criminals responsible for these atrocities to justice,\" he said in an emailed statement.  ", "Evidence from the Tuesday report is likely to be presented at a non-binding tribunal this week in The Hague, Stephen Rapp told CNN. Rapp, a former US ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues, is one of three judges hearing evidence on aggression in Ukraine. Rapp says the tribunal will decide whether there is sufficient evidence to confirm an indictment and issue an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"We hope that our proceedings will inspire the UN General Assembly to authorize the Secretary General to enter into an agreement with Ukraine to establish a tribunal with legal jurisdiction over aggression in Ukraine,\" Rapp told CNN.  ", "Back in Bashtanka, the hospital was rebuilt by the end of summer 2022 with the help of donors and volunteers from across the country, Barsehian said. And far from scaring the health workers away, the attacks have only made them more determined.  ", "\"Our job is not harder than the soldiers' one. We are used to all sorts of challenges,\" said Barsehian. \"We were not scared, we were angry.\"  "], "headline": "Report: Nearly one in every 10 hospitals in Ukraine have been damaged by attacks since Russia's invasion    ", "timestamp": "  Updated  6:41 PM EST, Thu February 23, 2023    ", "act": "/2023/02/21/europe/report-hospital-ukraine-attacks-russia-invasion-intl-dg"}}
