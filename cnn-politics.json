Ron DeSantis on Tuesday will release his book, \"The Courage to be Free,\" to much anticipation ahead of his expected plunge into the 2024 presidential race. But it's not the first time DeSantis has dabbled in authorship to jumpstart his political ambitions.  ", "As a little-known Navy prosecutor on the cusp of a bid for a Jacksonville-area congressional seat, DeSantis in 2011 released the audaciously titled \"Dreams from Our Founding Fathers.\" He has joked that the book - from an obscure publisher that mostly dealt in children's titles and a thriller series produced by a middle school principal - received little acclaim and was \"read by about a dozen people.\"   ", "Unlike most entries in the political genre, it's not a memoir and its autobiographical content is sparse. Rather, it's a lengthy critique of Barack Obama's political ascent and presidency, affixed on the hypothesis that the policies and philosophies of the country's first Black executive diverged dramatically from the \"enduring truths that the Constitution's creators relied upon when they framed America's foundational document.\" It litigates the case by contrasting the then-president's beliefs and background (pulling often from the Democrat's own best-selling 1995 autobiography, \"Dreams from My Father\") with the writings of the Founding Fathers.   ", "It's an instructive window into DeSantis' governing beliefs, which at times seem to collide with his current leadership style but may soon inform his platform as he seeks higher office. It shows the early seeds of his disdain for the media, strongly suggests Christianity is foundational to the Constitution and demonstrates his early willingness to buck establishment forces in his own party.  ", "As was the time, the book also serves as a full-throated defense of the tea party movement while eviscerating the Affordable Care Act, the healthcare law signed by Obama that provoked Republicans across the country - including DeSantis - to run for office. But it also makes historical arguments for the preservation of slavery and touches on Obama's roots and Muslim outreach in ways that Democrats have already amplified ahead of DeSantis' expected run for president.   ", "Here are four takeaways from the book.  ", "DeSantis' views on the country's founding document and the reach of the federal government is informed heavily by the Federalist Papers, the essays produced by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay to persuade New York to ratify the US Constitution. DeSantis writes that these essays represent \"the single best source for the exposition of the principles underlying the Constitution of the United States of America.\" It's these writings that often buttress DeSantis' criticisms of Obama and his insistence that the Democrat's vision of America is antithetical to its foundational document. To DeSantis, the very notion of a \"transformative\" presidency flies in the face of the static role of the executive envisioned by the Framers. (The word \"transform\" appears 75 times throughout the short work.)   ", "In his book, DeSantis argued that the Constitution's creators expected representatives to be responsive - though not beholden - to public opinion, especially when pursuing far-reaching pieces of legislation. As it is, DeSantis said, Obama and his allies should have looked at the decades of opposition to health care reform as a sign not to mess with it.   ", "DeSantis as governor, though, has often eschewed public opinion when taking actions and has proudly declared, \"I'm not going to lead based on polls.\" For example, DeSantis signed the most restrictive abortion law in Florida's modern history despite consistent support for making the procedure accessible to women.   ", "It's not the only inconsistent view on leadership between DeSantis the author and DeSantis the politician.   ", "DeSantis also took great umbrage at descriptions of Obama \"casting his candidacy as one of singular historical significance and himself as a messianic figure.\" But his own closing message to Florida voters last fall came in a 90-second video that suggested he was made by God on the eighth day to be a \"fighter.\"  ", "He also compared Obama with George Washington, who, DeSantis wrote, possessed \"a deep sense of humility, a humility that dovetailed superbly with the ethos of republican government.\" And he noted that the Founding Fathers warned of a demagogue leader who \"capitalizes on popular prejudices by peddling false claims, by employing questionable rhetorical techniques, or by intentionally sowing divisions among different factions or interests within the body politic.\"  ", "DeSantis as a Republican primary candidate for governor in 2018 campaigned almost exclusively on his endorsement from then-President Donald Trump, who often peddled false claims and once claimed, \"I alone can fix it.\"  ", "DeSantis at one point accused Obama of not paying fealty to the Constitution with the same vigor as his predecessors and suggested it was because of Obama's inability to look beyond the codification of slavery at the nation's birth. DeSantis wrote that after the 2010 midterms, \"a noticeably agitated Obama even declared, 'I couldn't go through the front door at this country's founding' \" - an opinion DeSantis called \"seriously flawed.\"  ", "DeSantis throughout the book is dismissive of criticism that the Founding Fathers are tainted by their failure to end the enslavement of Black Americans, and he described the preservation of slavery and the three-fifths compromise as necessary to ensure the passage of the Constitution - \"a view shared by strongly anti-slavery delegates like Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin,\" he wrote.  ", "\"Slavery had been a fact of life throughout human history, and had existed in Britain's American colonies for 150 years before the Convention at Philadelphia in 1787. In certain southern states, slave labor was the backbone of the entire economy, and immediately abolishing slavery would have represented an enlightened but also a monumental change - a revolution far more socially, politically and economically momentous than the American Revolution itself,\" DeSantis wrote. \"This is why there was no real chance that the Convention would abolish the peculiar institution of slavery.\"  ", "More recently, DeSantis has contended that the American revolution itself \"caused people to question slavery\" and birthed abolition movements.  ", "\"No one had questioned it before we decided as Americans that we are endowed by our creator with inalienable rights,\" DeSantis said last year.   ", "DeSantis went on to argue in his book that Obama's views were more closely aligned with the slavery defender Sen. Stephen A. Douglas, who lost the 1860 presidential election to Abraham Lincoln, than the great emancipator.   ", "\"Though Obama made every attempt to draw comparisons between himself and Lincoln, it is actually one of Lincoln's foremost political adversaries and one of Obama's predecessors, Stephen A. Douglas, who argued like Obama that the Founders meant to exclude non-whites from the natural rights clarion call contained in the Declaration of Independence.\"  ", "DeSantis would use this rhetorical trick again in the book to accuse Obama of ascribing to \"the same doctrine that Chief Justice Taney invoked in Dred Scott\" - the Supreme Court case that found enslaved African Americans could not claim citizenship and didn't enjoy the rights ascribed by the Constitution.   ", "This criticism of slavery's perversions clouding constitutional judgment extended to Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, the country's first Black justice, DeSantis contended. DeSantis took issue with Marshall's criticism of the Framers on the grounds that \"the government they devised was defective from the start.\"  ", "DeSantis wrote: \"Such criticism misses the mark.\"  ", "At the time DeSantis published his book, few topics animated voters like the 2010 passage of Obama's signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act.  ", "DeSantis accused the law's champions of putting \"America on a course to a government-run, single-payer system\" - a warning that has yet to materialize, though several Democratic candidates for president ran on such a policy during the 2020 election.  ", "DeSantis' opposition to \"ObamaCare\" isn't surprising on its face. As a lawmaker, he voted often with his Republican colleagues to repeal the Affordable Care Act and he was a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, which helped orchestrate a federal government shutdown aimed at defunding the law. But unlike some Republicans, who at times voiced support for the law's more popular provisions (like the requirement for insurance to cover children until age 26), DeSantis' opposition appeared wholesale.  ", "\"Initially justified by Obama as a needed remedy for the problem of rising health care costs that hurt members of the middle class, the post-passage euphoria revealed a different, more controversial justification for a federal overhaul of the health care system: the redistribution of wealth,\" DeSantis wrote.  ", "Even the requirement for insurance companies to cover adults and children with pre-existing conditions appeared problematic to DeSantis because it could lead to higher insurance costs.   ", "\"Though this sounded noble, the law had the effect of undermining insurance coverage for children,\" DeSantis contended. \"By mandating that insurers take on more risk than is economically justifiable, ObamaCare forced insurers either to absorb financial losses or else increase premiums for all policies.\"  ", "DeSantis in his book laid out a blueprint for leadership that is rigidly confined to a strict reading of the Constitution and adherence to \"fundamental law with stable meaning.\" This includes limitations on the executive branch's abilities and a rigorous adherence to separation of powers.   ", "As governor, DeSantis has at times flouted seemingly similar constraints on executive power that he often charged Obama with crossing in his book. For example, he accused Obama's then-health and human services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, of using \"her power to intimidate private businesses for engaging in speech she didn't like. This illustrates the progressive impulse to centralize authority in bureaucratic arrangements at its apogee.\" But as governor, DeSantis issued an eerily similar warning to businesses not to get in his way, or else.  ", "\"If you are in one of these corporations, if you're a woke CEO, you want to get involved in our legislative business, look, it's a free country,\" DeSantis said in 2021. \"But understand, if you do that, I'm fighting back against you. And I'm going to make sure that people understand your business practices, and anything I don't like about what you're doing.\"  ", "It's a lesson Disney certainly learned. After Disney opposed a state measure restricting certain classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity, DeSantis went after the company's special taxing authority. Earlier this month, state lawmakers voted to give DeSantis new powers over the government that controls the land around Disney's Orlando-area theme parks.   ", "This orthodoxy, though, is also built on a belief that the federal government's powers are far more limited than what is delegated to the states. Does this mean that DeSantis would chart a new path as president, were he to ascend to the highest office? Or does he believe that the \"transformational\" presidency he so maligned has changed the office for good in ways that he intends to follow. Maybe his next book will hold some of these answers.

The ONE Campaign was co-founded by Bono and aims \"to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030,\" according to its website.   ", "Excerpts of that conversation are below.  ", "WOLF: For starters, how exactly does PEPFAR work?", "HART: PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, is the US bilateral program to provide care treatment and prevention for people suffering from HIV. Caring for those impacted and their families and orphans - preventative measures like condoms and education and training and treatment.   ", "That last bit, treatment, was what was revolutionary, frankly, at the time. Twenty years ago, there was not any strategy or a conception that you could provide wide-scale treatment in sub-Saharan Africa or other resource-poor settings.  ", "It was quite radical, frankly, to develop a plan to simplify drug regimens and get them widely distributed, as President Bush described, by motorcycle and bicycle if necessary. How it happened is a longer story, but that is what the crux of the program was, and it has been wildly successful over the years.   ", "It has exceeded its goals many, many times over and been endorsed by every president since and funded by every Congress since then - a really transformative program in terms of the lives that it saved, now 25 million lives over 20 years.  ", "WOLF: I have heard that figure a lot, and it's amazing. I haven't seen where that figure came from. How did we calculate that it saved 25 million lives?", "HART: PEPFAR has done an extraordinary job of keeping track of the data. The health workers are issued these small iPads, and they keep track of every drug and every dose that is delivered.   ", "They diagnose those who need to be put on treatment, put them on treatment and then will follow up. ... And so that number comes from PEPFAR itself, having looked at all the interventions that they've put in and ascribe a value to their contribution to the lives saved over that time.   ", "WOLF: The State Department's plan for PEPFAR is to eradicate AIDS as a global health threat by 2030. What exactly does that mean?", "HART: It means that we've got to get many more people tested and on the treatment regimen. It has a lot to do with prevention, particularly the hardest hit and marginalized populations like young women.   ", "One of the largest groups of people who are contracting the disease now are our younger women and LGBTQ and other marginalized people. So it's going to be very, very difficult and take a concerted effort to deliver prevention and treatment services to those who remain.   ", "The 2030 goal is one that everyone shares. Although the pandemic did set back efforts, but it did not reverse it. PEPFAR continued to deliver services, both prevention and treatment services across Africa, even during the pandemic. And interestingly, some of the infrastructure, the lab services and health care training and other medical investments through PEPFAR over the last 20 years were used in some of the Covid response.  ", "WOLF: Is there a threshold by which we know we've succeeded in doing that? ", "HART: What's amazing about these medicines is that people will live with HIV. So it will still be among us.   ", "But it will be at a level that is controlled within each individual - and then that the spread has been reduced to a level that it will be able to be managed as a public health issue. There is not, at the moment, that goal to eradicate it completely, like smallpox or the work that's going on with polio. ", "WOLF: I read a Kaiser Family Foundation synopsis of the program that much of the structure of PEPFAR will continue regardless of whether it is reauthorized by Congress. Is it a problem if it's not reauthorized?", "HART: I think it is a problem. For a couple of reasons.   ", "One, Kaiser is absolutely right. Federal programs can continue even if the date on the authorization legislation expires. That is true for many federal programs, not just this one.   ", "But it is a problem in that it is on a political level very important to maintain the bipartisan support and just the overall knowledge of Congress for this incredible life-saving program that Congresses before them have endorsed and funded.   ", "We really embrace the reauthorization process, and the education that it provides is something that every member of Congress, and more importantly, their constituents, should be incredibly proud of.   ", "Most American citizens don't realize that they've saved 25 million lives around the world and the families and communities and goodwill that has come from that. It's just an extraordinary success story.   ", "So the reason to do it is both political, and the second reason is that there may be rule changes in the House. This is something that we're still sorting out.  ", "There have been some conversations that unauthorized programs would not be funded. There are many, many programs that are unauthorized at the moment. We want to make sure that there is no reason not to fully endorse and fund this important program.  ", "WOLF: This is an example of true bipartisanship and bringing people together from all different sides. Tell me a little bit about how that process occurred 20 years ago.", "HART: It was the convergence of a bunch of different things that happened, one of which is building on the debt relief campaign in '98, '99 and the coming of the millennium in 2000.   ", "You had to bring together politically left and politically right, people of faith, humanitarian organizations and others around debt cancellation. It created an interesting coalition of people. Strange bedfellows.   ", "I'm talking about relieving the debts of the poorest countries. Rooted in the biblical notion that every 50 years should be a year of jubilee, when land is allowed to lie fallow, slaves were freed and debts were forgiven.   ", "And this curious coalition of people who came together, and politicians who came together on debt cancellation work, first of all realized that any of the savings from debt relief were going to be completely swallowed up by the catastrophe that was the HIV/AIDS pandemic.   ", "The working alliances of politicians and activists on the right and left were maintained and expanded around HIV. We had the chairman of the pro-life caucus working with the Congressional Black Caucus. We had LGBT activists and evangelical pastors.   ", "People came together through various lenses and various interests through this.   ", "There was bipartisan legislation before PEPFAR was announced. It was supported by (Sens.) John Kerry (of Massachusetts) and Bill Frist (of Tennessee), and in the House by Barbara Lee (of California) and Jim Kolbe (of Arizona), saying the United States needed a bolder response to the AIDS pandemic. Not anywhere close to what President Bush ended up announcing, but to encourage more to be done.   ", "You mentioned the bipartisanship. It was a time where compromise was still valued, and those cross-party conversations were able to happen.   ", "There were incredible disagreements around the treatment focus, incredible arguments around how do you do prevention. There was this famous debate over ABC: abstinence, being faithful and condoms. It turns out you need all three, but that was a really intense debate. There was a lot of effort to expand the remit beyond HIV, and include malaria and other health issues.  ", "Lots of compromises, hard-fought but goodwill toward the broader goal of saving as many lives from HIV as possible.   ", "Those compromises, rolling up the sleeves in the backroom, created alliances and indeed friendships that have lasted over many, many years.   ", "And that's one of the things that we try to remind new Congress' new members and their constituencies: Compromise is necessary in order to make big things happen.  ", "WOLF: One of those compromises of the original law was that a third of prevention funding had to go to abstinence-only education, which in my ears today seems kind of crazy. I'm sure to a lot of people it seemed kind of crazy back then. But in compromise, you have to give something up.", "HART: That's just it. Is it a perfect piece of legislation? Is it perfect public health policy? No.   ", "But the larger good that came from those compromises, and those disagreements, having both sides come together and 20 years later, and $110 billion approved just wouldn't have happened unless both sides were at the table, arguing about their own values and what worked and what didn't work.   ", "Keeping the big picture in mind and making sacrifices for things that you thought were the most important things for the greater good was what was necessary. We've lost sight of that now. It's become even more difficult.  ", "WOLF: At the same time, you refer to that as a time when compromise was still valued. I'm thinking back to 2003. Kerry and Bush were about to have an incredibly contentious presidential campaign. The larger story at the time was about the Iraq War. Bush was reviled by a large portion of the international community for that. I don't want to lose sight of that. How does PEPFAR, which everybody can agree was an accomplishment, change Bush's legacy in terms of the war?", "HART: I will quote my co-founder here, Bono, who says, \"You don't have to agree on everything if the one thing you can agree on is important enough.\" Even though said by an Irish rock star, those are probably wise words for politics.   ", "Absolutely, we knew the divisions around the Iraq War, and obviously the ONE Campaign did not weigh in on that. But many Democrats were fiercely opposed.   ", "Barbara Lee, I think, was the only person to vote against military intervention in Afghanistan after 9/11 and yet was the chief advocate on the Democratic side for a global response and worked with the Republicans very effectively to move this legislation forward.   ", "If politics is the art of the possible that is, you have to be able to say I vigorously don't agree with you on this. But if we can agree on that, we can make a big change. And that's what happened with HIV.   ", "If you're an advocate like Bono or the ONE Campaign or many others, do you wonder, am I giving cover to someone you don't agree with on a whole host of things. But the opportunity to do something great - and I think history has shown that PEPFAR is one of President Bush's great legacies. I'm just grateful that folks were able to understand where they disagreed and yet charted a path where they could agree.  ", "WOLF: The domestic political conversation is increasingly about the US debt, which is more than $31 trillion now. Republicans are insistent there will be some spending cuts, and I think we can all agree that's probably going to happen. When you're in a Republican member of Congress' office arguing for international aid, how do you make that argument when there's so much focus on the debt here at home?", "HART: Great question. Polling over 20 years has consistently told us that the American public thinks we spend around 20% of the budget on foreign aid. It's less than 1%.   ", "So the magnitude of what foreign aid occupies in terms of the budget versus the impact that it has globally is one of the first things that we talk about.   ", "The second is that it is far cheaper to prevent catastrophe and conflict. The United States is very good about responding to catastrophe and conflict. But if we can prevent it beforehand, whether it's a health disaster or even the instability that is caused from severe economic strain.  ", "The foreign aid that the United States provides, which is very targeted, is measured and the results are carefully tracked - we have seen that it has demonstrable impact across the world for just pennies of our federal budget, and we believe an excellent investment in the way the United States both presents itself in the world and serves our interests.

He told The New York Times he handed over the security tapes because he had \"promised\" to do so. The speaker gave such an undertaking to Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, a GOP source told CNN's Melanie Zanona, in his quest to secure the gavel, but the apparent deal did not specify that Carlson should get the footage.

Just as McCarthy is apparently unwilling to challenge the power of conservative media, Fox appeared unwilling to alienate a conservative audience that wanted to believe Trump won. CNN has reached out to Fox News and Carlson with questions about how the security footage will be handled but had not received a response as of Thursday evening.

", "\"The voters of his district have elected him,\" McCarthy said of the freshman in January, suggesting that to demand the resignation of the New York Republican would be an affront to democracy - even though it appears voters had no idea of the truth about Santos when they sent him to Washington. McCarthy has since hinted that his position could change if the House Ethics Committee \"finds something\" against Santos, who won a district that Biden carried in 2020 and that could be tough for the GOP to hold.   ", "McCarthy's stances have led to criticism and enraged Democrats, who say his release of the footage to Carlson could endanger the security of the Capitol. But in America's bitter political climate, appealing to activist political bases is often the first consideration - especially in the radicalized Republican Party of the Trump era. In the modern GOP, earning the anger of the media is an essential element of appealing to grassroots voters and often seems a major motivation of top party figures.

It was a balancing act that eventually doomed their tenures. McCarthy appears to be taking the opposite tack, throwing his lot in completely with the extremists who have outsized influence due to the far-smaller-than-expected House majority the GOP managed to win in the 2022 midterms.

Trump might be posing as a savior now, but he presided over a slashing of environmental and safety regulations in office. Huge transportation firms, meanwhile, pay lobbyists millions of dollars to loosen safety rules and staffing levels as they seek to maximize profits, even while rewarding shareholders and scrimping on safety.

He boasted how he had deployed the Federal Emergency Management Agency - which is currently operating in East Palestine - during his presidency. He didn't mention his own criticized disaster mismanagement, however, after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017 or during the Covid-19 pandemic.  ", "Trump sidestepped a question over his role in weakening safety standards after he repealed an Obama administration rule requiring freight railroads to employ electronically controlled pneumatic brakes on certain trains hauling hazardous and flammable cargos. The measure wouldn't have stopped the East Palestine disaster since the train that derailed there didn't have sufficient cars of such a type that would have triggered the rule had it still been in force. But critics have charged that Trump's slashing of such rules and his elimination of regulations across the board made railroads and Americans less safe.

Nikki Haley asked whether Biden shouldn't be \"with those people in Ohio.\" Haley's attack seemed inconsistent with her vow to be tougher than Biden on Russian President Vladimir Putin. After all, the president traveled to Europe around the anniversary of the Russian invasion to warn Putin would never win the war. And former Vice President Mike Pence, who might also run in 2024, said he was \"glad\" that Biden went to Ukraine \"but he should have gone to East Palestine first.\"   ", "Given his political profile, Buttigieg is one of the most famous Transportation secretaries in modern history.

", "That outcome underscores the obstacles facing Biden now as he tries to recapture older voters by portraying Republicans as threats to the two towers of America's safety net for the elderly. While polls consistently show that voters trust Democrats more than Republicans to safeguard the programs, GOP presidential nominees have carried all seniors in every presidential election back to 2004 and have reached at least 58% support among White seniors in each of the past four contests, exit polls have found. Democrats have likewise consistently struggled among those nearing retirement, older working adults aged 45-64.   ", "Those results suggest that for most older voters, affinity for the GOP messages on other issues - particularly its resistance, in the Donald Trump era, to cultural and racial change - has outweighed their views about Social Security and Medicare. Those grooves are now cut so deeply, over so many elections, that Biden may struggle to change them much no matter how hard he rails against a range of GOP proposals that could retrench or restructure the programs.  ", "Biden's charge that Republicans are threatening the two giant entitlement programs for the elderly - which triggered his striking back and forth exchanges with GOP legislators during the State of the Union - fits squarely in his broader political positioning as he turns toward his expected reelection campaign.  ", "As I've written, the 80-year-old Biden, at his core, \"remains something like a pre-1970s Democrat, who is most comfortable with a party focused less on cultural crusades than on delivering kitchen-table benefits to people who work with their hands.\" As president he's expressed that inclination primarily through what he calls his \"blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America\" - the planks in his economic plans, such as generous incentives to revive domestic manufacturing, aimed at creating more opportunity for workers without a college degree. Politically, Biden's staunch defense of Social Security and Medicare, programs critical to the economic security of financially vulnerable retirees, represents a logical bookend to that emphasis.  ", "\"We all know that whose side you are on is a critical debate point for every election and this debate over Social Security and Medicare really helps crystallize whose side Biden is on versus whose side Republicans are on in a very effective way for him,\" said Democratic pollster Matt Hogan, who helped conduct an extensive series of bipartisan polls during the 2022 campaign measuring attitudes among seniors for the AARP, the giant lobby for the elderly.  ", "From Franklin Roosevelt through Hubert Humphrey and Tip O'Neill, generations of Democrats have framed themselves as the defenders of the social safety net for seniors against Republicans who they say would unravel it. Biden showed how comfortable he was stepping into those shoes during his 2012 vice-presidential debate with Ryan, then a young representative from Wisconsin who Romney had selected as his running mate.  ", "Nearly 30 years Biden's junior, Ryan was an unflinching advocate of restructuring Social Security and Medicare to reduce costs over time. In particular, Ryan was the principal supporter of a conservative plan to convert Medicare, the giant federal health insurance program for the elderly, into a system called \"premium support.\" Under that proposal, Medicare would be transformed from its current structure, in which the government directly pays doctors and hospitals who provide care for beneficiaries, into a voucher (or \"premium support\") system, in which the government would provide recipients a fixed sum to purchase private insurance. Ryan had also drafted proposals to partially privatize Social Security by allowing workers to divert part of their payroll taxes into private investment accounts, a change that would have reduced the tax dollars flowing into the system and eventually required substantial cuts in guaranteed benefits.  ", "For nearly 11 minutes during the debate in October 2012, moderator Martha Raddatz of ABC skillfully guided Biden and Ryan through a heated, but civil and substantive, discussion of Social Security and Medicare's future. Ryan insisted that changes were needed to preserve the programs' long-term viability and that current seniors and those near retirement would not see their benefits reduced.  ", "Biden appealed openly to the Democrats' historic image as the programs' protectors and condemned Ryan and the GOP for wanting to partially privatize them. At one point in the debate, Biden declared: \"we will be no part of a [Medicare] voucher program or the privatization of Social Security.\" A few moments later, he insisted: \"These guys haven't been big on Medicare from the beginning. And they've always been about Social Security as little as you can do. Look, folks, use your common sense. Who do you trust on this?\"  ", "At the time, Democrats felt Biden had at least held his own, restoring the party's momentum after Obama's surprisingly listless performance eight days earlier in his first debate against Romney. And Democrats through the rest of the campaign railed against the Republican ticket as a threat to Social Security and Medicare.  ", "But on election day, those arguments did not translate into gains for Obama and Biden among seniors or the older working adults (aged 45-64) nearing retirement. As Hogan noted, the newly passed Affordable Care Act, which generated some of its funding through savings in Medicare, was extremely unpopular at the time among older voters. Obama and Biden not only lost seniors and the older working age adults, but actually ran slightly more poorly among both groups in 2012 than they did in 2008.  ", "In fact, no Democratic presidential nominee since Al Gore in 2000 has carried most seniors in a presidential campaign; Obama in 2008 was the only one since Gore to carry most of the older working age adults. Among older Whites, the Democratic deficit is even more pronounced: the Republican presidential nominee has carried around three-fifths of both White seniors and those nearing retirement in each of the past four elections. Biden in 2020 slightly improved on Hillary Clinton's anemic 2016 performance with both groups, but still lost to Trump by 15 percentage points among White seniors and by 23 points among the Whites nearing retirement, according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. Biden performed especially poorly among older Whites without a college degree - an economically stressed group heavily reliant on the federal retirement programs.  ", "Estimates by Catalist, a Democratic targeting firm, and the Pew Research Center likewise found that Trump in both 2016 and 2020 beat his Democratic opponents among both seniors and the older working adults. Like the exit polls, the Catalist data show the Republican nominees carrying about three-fifths of White seniors and older working adults in each of the past three presidential elections.  ", "The story is similar in congressional contests. In House elections, the exit polls found Republicans winning all seniors and older working adults comfortably in the 2014 and 2022 midterm campaigns and narrowly carrying them even in 2018 when Democrats romped overall. In all three of those midterm congressional elections, Republicans carried about three-fifths of the near retirement White adults, while they also reached that elevated threshold among White seniors in both the 2014 and 2022 campaigns.  ", "Republicans have maintained these advantages with older voters despite polls showing that most Americans trust Democrats more than the GOP to protect Social Security and Medicare, and that most Americans, especially seniors, oppose the intermittently surfacing GOP proposals to partially privatize both programs.  ", "Politically, \"Democrats have used Social Security and Medicare really a lot over the past two or three decades, maybe four decades,\" said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. \"The payoff has been a lot less than Democrats have generally thought it would be.\"  ", "Could this time be different for Biden and the Democrats? Congressional Republicans have certainly provided plenty of evidence for his claim that they still hope to restructure the programs. The proposed 2023 budget by the Republican Study Committee, the members of which include about three-fourths of House Republicans, reprises the ideas of converting Medicare into a premium support system and establishing private investment accounts under Social Security, while also raising the retirement age for both programs and reducing Social Security benefits over time. And although Florida Sen. Rick Scott renounced the idea late last week, his \"Rescue America\" agenda did include a proposal to require Congress to reauthorize all federal programs, including Social Security and Medicare, every five years.  ", "These ideas have precipitated an unusual degree of open Republican dissension. Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell repeatedly, and unreservedly, denounced the Scott plan until the Florida senator backed off. Trump recently released a video in which he declared the GOP should not cut \"a single penny\" of Social Security or Medicare benefits - which put him directly at odds with the three-fourths of House Republicans in the Republican Study Committee. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, bending more toward Trump's position, seems unlikely to incorporate into the GOP budget plans the RSC's most sweeping changes in Social Security and Medicare.  ", "Kessler believes Biden may succeed where other Democrats have failed at hurting the GOP with the issue, and he argued that the conspicuous Republican infighting demonstrates they share that concern. \"We are watching a high-profile battle that I've never really seen before on these issues in the Republican Party,\" Kessler said. \"And part of it is clearly they think it's a problem when they didn't years ago. If they think it's a problem, maybe it's a problem.\"  ", "Stuart Stevens, who served as Romney's chief strategist in the 2012 campaign but has since become a fierce critic of the Trump-era GOP, also believes the party could face more risk over its entitlement agenda than it did back then. The reason is that he thinks the idea of sunsetting Social Security and Medicare every five years, even if Scott is trying to jettison it, may prove more immediately tangible and understandable to voters than Ryan's complex ideas of partially privatizing both programs.   ", "\"The question I always ask myself in campaigns is 'are you talking about something the other side doesn't want to talk about?'\" Stevens said. \"That's probably a good sign that they are losing on the issue.\"  ", "Whether Biden proves more effective than other recent Democrats at attracting older voters around Social Security and Medicare will likely pivot on whether seniors believe the GOP genuinely would cut the programs if given the power to do so, argued Robert Blendon, a professor emeritus at the Harvard School of Public Health, who specializes in public attitudes about the social safety net. \"If the senior community actually believes that it's being threatened it really would affect their votes,\" he predicted. But, he added, \"as long as they are not threatened, the other values of seniors on top issues more and more correspond with Republicans.\"  ", "There's no doubt about the second half of that equation. Polling has consistently found that older Whites, in particular, are more receptive than their younger counterparts to hardline Trump-era GOP messages around crime, immigration and the broader currents of racial and cultural change: for instance, about half of Whites older than 50 agree that discrimination against Whites is now as big a problem as bias against minorities, a far higher percentage than among younger Whites, according to a new national survey by the Public Religion Research Institute. Older Whites are also more likely than younger generations to lack a college degree or to identify as Christians, attributes that generally predict sympathy for GOP cultural and racial arguments.  ", "Through the 21st century, those cultural and racial attitudes among older White voters have consistently trumped any concerns they may hold about the Republican commitment to Social Security and Medicare. Despite Biden's impassioned articulation of the case against the GOP, that didn't change even in 2012 when Republicans placed on their national ticket a vice presidential nominee who directly embodied the GOP aspirations to reconfigure and retrench those programs.   ", "Even small changes in seniors' preferences could have a big impact in closely balanced states with a large retiree population like Arizona and Pennsylvania. But the entrenched GOP advantage among older voters over the past two decades suggests Biden's hopes in 2024 may pivot less on improving with the \"gray\" than maximizing his vote among the \"brown\": the diverse, younger generations that recoil from the same Republican messages on culture and race that electrify so many older Whites.

", "The president of the United States, in overcoat and shades, strolled through Kyiv in daylight, visiting a historic church as air raid sirens wailed and standing exposed alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky in the city's vast, open and iconic St. Michael's Square.   ", "His presence sent a message of defiance to Putin most directly and a cherished sign of resolve and empathy for the people of Ukraine. His audience also included European powers in a western alliance that Biden has led and invigorated like no president since the end of the Cold War. And every time a commander-in-chief makes such an audacious splash on the world stage he's also making a point to Americans - on whose support continuing extraordinary support for Ukraine's war effort depends - and to his own fervent domestic critics.  ", "Biden deliberately contrasted the sense of then and now that his visit, just before the anniversary of Russia's invasion, conjured.  ", "\"That dark night one year ago, the world was literally at the time bracing for the fall of Kyiv,\" Biden told Zelensky at a news conference flanked by the Stars and Stripes and Ukraine's distinctive blue and yellow national flag. The event itself carried its own symbolism - it did not feature two leaders cowering in a bunker, but went ahead in an ornate room like any other leaders' press conference in any other capital.  ", "\"One year later, Kyiv stands. And Ukraine stands. Democracy stands,\" he declared. \"The Americans stand with you and the world stands with you.\"  ", "Biden's words might have lacked the poetry of \"Ich bin ein Berliner,\" or \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\" But Biden's visit instantly went down in history alongside two defining trips to divided Berlin by Presidents John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan that were flashpoints of the Cold War and each of which sent their own image of US resolve to the Kremlin.  ", "Those events made clear that the United States stood with its Western allies for as long as it took to prevail over the Soviet Union. Biden's visit was meant to give similar historic heft to his comment Washington is there for \"as long as it takes\" - though it's unlikely that it will assuage fears in Kyiv and Europe that a change in president might weaken that US vow.  ", "Biden's secret visit, which involved the president leaving the US unannounced and heading to an active war zone, matched some of the colorful stagecraft that Zelensky - a master of public relations - has used to maintain Western support for his people and the multi-billion-dollar pipeline of weapons and aid.  ", "During America's Middle East wars of the last 20 years, Americans became accustomed to Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump leaving Washington in the dead of night and popping up in Baghdad or Kabul to visit US troops and US-backed leaders. And while those trips had their own measure of daring and danger, Biden's visit went a step further - venturing into a foreign capital that is often under air attack and lacks the security offered by large garrisons of American troops and air assets. The US did inform Russia of the plans to visit for \"deconfliction purposes,\" according to Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan.   ", "Biden had always planned to visit Europe this week to mark the anniversary of the Russian invasion - though his public program mentioned only a trip to neighboring Poland. But a journey across the Atlantic that lacked a Ukrainian component would have been unsatisfactory given that fact that many European leaders have already visited Kyiv. Still, the security footprint of the US president is far greater than the one accompanying those leaders, and his position as the leader of the West leaves him far more exposed.   ", "But by not visiting Ukraine, Biden would have been implicitly admitting that there were some things that Putin could prevent him from doing - in effect showing US weakness.  ", "Ukrainians understood the intent better than anyone.  ", "\"The tipping point in this war will not be when we receive another set of weapons but when our alliance will stop playing reactive roles to what Putin will do,\" Kira Rudik, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, told \"CNN This Morning.\"  ", "\"President Biden has claimed the upper hand ... and tomorrow Putin will have to reply to what happened today,\" Rudik said, referring to a speech in which Putin is expected to rally the Russian people on Tuesday.  ", "Political symbolism is only effective if it gets results, drives policy and changes an entrenched situation.  ", "So, like the Berlin visits of Kennedy and Reagan, the true historic sweep of Biden's perilous journey to Ukraine can only be judged in the light of subsequent events. In other words, his gesture will be an empty one if Russia - which appears to be mustering for a spring offensive - wins the war.  ", "And while the pictures of Biden in Kyiv were remarkable, they cannot disguise real questions and uncertainties surrounding the US approach to the war and differences with the Ukrainians. This plays out both in the types of weapons the US is prepared to offer and potentially in divergent scenarios about how the war could end. The phrase \"as long as it takes\" can mean different things to different people and there is every sign that this war, which Putin cannot afford to lose, could grind on for many bloody more years, testing Western resolve.  ", "The personal nature of the president's rebuke to Putin is meanwhile likely to trigger a response from a ruthless leader who has shown no mercy to civilians and a cruel indifference to the value of human life - Russian as well as Ukrainian. One potential way Biden's visit could backfire is that it could bolster Putin's claim that he is really fighting a war against the West rather than an independent sovereign nation - a framing that is popular among some Russians and is one Biden has tried to avoid.  ", "The president's visit only served to expose growing opposition to the war among conservative Republicans at home - which, if not yet near the levels that could force him to desert Ukraine, is sufficient to raise concerns about the size of future aid packages and what a new president after 2024 - Trump or a GOP leader who shares his \"America First\" tendencies - could mean for Ukraine.  ", "The most glaring difference between Biden and Zelensky lies in the kind of weapons the US president is willing to provide. The government in Kyiv is ratcheting up its campaign for the West to send F-16 jets and is now getting increasing buy-in from some influential bipartisan members of Congress.   ", "Biden has so far declined to agree to the request, which gets to the heart of a dilemma that defines his war strategy: How far to go to help Kyiv win while avoiding a direct clash between the West and Russia.  ", "Texas Rep. Mike McCaul, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, complained on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday that Washington had taken too long to send game-changing weapons to Ukraine in the past and should not make the same mistake with warplanes. Asked if the Biden administration was now considering the dispatch of F-16 fighter planes, the Texas Republican replied: \"I hope so,\" and added, \"I think the momentum is building for this to happen.\"  ", "Sending US-made jets to Ukraine could be even more sensitive than the dispatch of the tanks to which the president just agreed.  ", "This is because they would enhance Ukraine's capacity to potentially strike at Russian jets and air defense systems inside Russia. The use of NATO aircraft in such operations - even with Ukrainian pilots - could prompt the Kremlin to conclude the alliance has directly intervened in the war, increasing the risk of a disastrous escalation of the conflict Biden has tried to avoid.  ", "But retired US Brig. Gen. Steve Anderson told CNN's Poppy Harlow Monday that Biden's visit came at another turning point in the war.  ", "\"This is a great show of leadership by President Biden. Good leaders always go to the sound of the guns.\" But, Anderson added: \"The United States needs to make a decision. Are we in it to ensure the Ukrainians simply not lose? Or are we in it so they can actually win?\"  ", "Less importantly globally but still significantly, Biden's trip to Ukraine had domestic political implications.   ", "A grueling and dangerous journey that required energy and endurance felt like a jab at critics who question whether Biden should be contemplating a reelection race at the age of 80.   ", "And like Biden's State of the Union address earlier this month, his stagecraft infuriated the most extreme wing of the Republican Party, which Biden has said is a danger to US democracy and values. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, for instance, quickly slammed Biden for journeying to Ukraine and other GOP figures accused him of caring more for Kyiv's borders than those in the US.  ", "\"This is incredibly insulting. Today on our President's Day, Joe Biden, the President of the United States chose Ukraine over America, while forcing the American people to pay for Ukraine's government and war. I can not express how much Americans hate Joe Biden,\" Greene said in a tweet.

But Greene's comment did not just exemplify the deterioration in civility in US politics. It was revealing from a pro-Trump Republican who has been supportive of the insurrectionists who tried to destroy American democracy on January 6, 2021.

There has been a wide variation on that from year to year. Some years, the median candidate gets in really early (January 2007 for the 2008 cycle on both the Democratic and Republican side), while other years it's much later (August 1991 for the 1992 cycle on the Democratic side).

Democrats, for example, won the presidency in both 1992 and 2008, even with a much later start in 1992.   ", "What does seem to matter for winning a primary is when candidates get into the race compared with their competitors. In the 17 primaries since 1972 that did not feature an incumbent, 10 of the winning candidates entered earlier than that year's median candidate. Two of the winners were the median candidates. Five got into the race later than the median candidate.   ", "There were six who started running about one and a half months or more before that cycle's median candidate.

", "Getting in the public eye early, raising money and building an organization are key to winning a presidential campaign. If you fall too far behind, it can be a disaster.   ", "Even candidates you might \"think\" entered the race late, often got in far earlier. Trump's June 2015 official announcement became well known for his ride down the escalator. Less remembered was the fact that he started an exploratory committee in March 2015, and he was already campaigning at the time.

John Delaney in the 2020 cycle filed with the FEC for the Democratic primary less than a year after the previous presidential election. Neither got very far.  ", "Still, on the whole, joining early is better than getting in late. After all, the winners who have gotten in late didn't get that late. The latest, for example, was Republican Ronald Reagan in the 1980 campaign. He entered less than three months after the median candidate.

They had previously run for president and were well known nationally, so they didn't need time to build name recognition or a campaign and fundraising apparatus.

Rick Perry in the 2012 cycle. Both Republicans entered with a splash and proceeded to win zero primaries combined. The same was true for Democrat Mike Bloomberg in the 2020 cycle, though he won American Samoa.

That's about a month and a half later than when the median nonincumbent's campaign gets started.   ", "Some presidents do go early. Trump's failed 2020 reelection campaign started the moment he entered the White House. (He formed an exploratory committee on Inauguration Day.)

We've tripled it - we've almost tripled it there.\"  ", "Santos also publicly claimed last year to have maternal Jewish grandparents who survived the Holocaust by fleeing Europe for Brazil. Multiple genealogists have told CNN that there is no proof for any of this story, and records list those grandparents as having been born in Brazil. (Santos told Morgan that he stands by his claims, that his grandparents \"falsified a lot of their documents\" while in Brazil to make it look like they were born there, and that he has ordered \"DNA test kits, and I've done four of them so far, and I'm just waiting for their return.\")  ", "Santos' narrative about his identity has sometimes varied. The Forward found one 2022 interview where he called himself \"a good old Catholic, right, but with a Jewish mother\" and said he was \"half Jewish, half Catholic.\" In a 2020 interview, he spoke of his supposed Jewish ancestry but said \"I'm Catholic\" and that he was \"not trying to claim Jewish heritage or anything\" - yet also said, \"I believe we're all Jewish at the end, because Jesus Christ was Jewish.\"   ", "Regardless, his claim that he \"never claimed to be Jewish\" is just not true. He has made the claim publicly and unequivocally.

Santos did not make a joke about being \"Jew-ish\" in his speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition; rather, he simply claimed to be Jewish. While Santos chuckled during his remark about his election victory having \"almost tripled\" the number of Jewish Republicans in Congress, and while it sounded like some audience members laughed here too, there was no sign that he was joking about his identity itself. The Republican Jewish Coalition has disavowed him.", "On Monday, after a CNBC reporter tweeted a debunking of Santos' claim to Morgan - telling Santos that he had not called himself \"Jew-ish\" in the speech and had actually \"suggested to the crowd you were an incoming Jewish lawmaker\" - coalition chief executive officer Matt Brooks tweeted in support of the debunking: \"Fact check: TRUE!\" Brooks said in a statement in December: \"We are very disappointed in Congressman-elect Santos. He deceived us and misrepresented his heritage.

Santos conceded he had made up the claim about the NYU degree but said, \"The reality is, I don't know where that 'GMAT' comes from. I never put that out on my website or my bio.\"  ", "When Morgan correctly said the claim about the GMAT score was on his resume, Santos said, \"Which - the resume was never furnished or supplied by me.\" When Morgan asked who supplied it, Santos said, \"I have no idea where that came from.\" He added, \"I didn't supply it, and nobody associated with me supplied it. That came from the GOP, and I'm still trying to understand where that came from.\"  ", "Facts First: Santos \"personally presented\" this resume to the Nassau County Republican Committee at an in-person meeting while he was seeking the committee's support in the 2020 election, committee spokesperson Mike Deery told CNN on Tuesday.", "New York Times published the resume in January and reported that Santos had provided it to the committee as he pursued his unsuccessful 2020 run.

The FBI has interviewed Osthoff about the allegation.  ", "Santos said, \"I've never met this man.\" Asked about the GoFundMe page, Santos said he has set up \"numerous\" GoFundMe pages over the years for animals in need, but \"many of them\" were \"managed by other people,\" just set up under his name because \"I was the main account holder on the Facebook page.\" He said Osthoff's dog would have received the surgery if Osthoff had ever met Santos. And he said soon after: \"If there's a GoFundMe page, and if they're going to present me with one, I'm not gonna deny that. But I've never met him, I've never took on this case, and I never took the money from his dog.\"  ", "Facts First: Santos deceptively minimized his involvement in the fundraiser for Osthoff's dog. Santos communicated with Osthoff at length about the fundraiser - in numerous text messages that Osthoff has provided to CNN and, according to Santos' own comments in the text chat, by phone as well. In addition, the GoFundMe page for Osthoff's dog was created under one of the names Santos has used, Anthony Devolder, and Santos (under the name George Devolder) promoted the GoFundMe page with a post on his own Facebook page.", "Osthoff said in a Tuesday message to CNN: \"He spoke with me on the phone numerous times, his NAME was in the title of the GoFundMe, and I have provided the press and law enforcement with dozens of text messages between Devolder and myself.\" He said Santos \"knows what happened.\"  ", "GoFundMe said in a January statement to CNN: \"When we received a report of an issue with this fundraiser in late 2016, our trust and safety team sought proof of the delivery of funds from the organizer.

", "The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program allows certain government and nonprofit employees to seek federal student loan forgiveness after making 10 years of qualifying payments.   ", "A qualifying borrower's full remaining balance is canceled, regardless of the amount.  ", "Teachers, social workers, some nurses and doctors as well as government lawyers are some of the types of borrowers who may be eligible.  ", "There are several qualifying restrictions. First, a borrower must be working full time for an eligible government or nonprofit for at least 10 years. Second, a borrower must have federal Direct Loans and have made 120 monthly loan payments under an income-driven repayment plan, which sets payments based on income and family size.  ", "If all of those requirements are met and a borrower has submitted the PSLF form to the Department of Education, the government will cancel his or her remaining federal student loan debt.  ", "A yearlong waiver that expanded eligibility for the PSLF program expired on October 31, but some of those temporary changes will be made permanent starting in July 2023.   ", "Under the new rules, borrowers will be able to receive credit toward PSLF on payments that are made late, in installments or in a lump sum. Prior rules only counted a payment as eligible if it was made in full within 15 days of its due date.  ", "Also, time spent in certain periods of deferment or forbearance will count toward PSLF. These periods include deferments for cancer treatment, military service, economic hardship and time served in AmeriCorps and the National Guard.

To address those problems, the Biden administration is conducting a recount, expecting to bring many borrowers closer to forgiveness. The recount started last November.

The administration said it expects some of the provisions of the new plan to take effect later this year.

It's on the one hand trying to present itself publicly as neutral and seeking peace, while at the same time it's talking up Russia's false narrative about the war.

Ted Cruz and FBI Director Chris Wray, as well as John Eastman, the attorney who spearheaded the plan to disrupt Congress certification of the 2020 results.

", "\"Injecting campaign-style politics into the criminal investigatory process with his rhetorical characterization of Mr. Smith's subpoena as a 'Biden D.O.J. subpoena,' Mr. Pence is trying to score points with voters who want to see President Biden unseated in 2024. Well enough. That's what politicians do,\" Luttig writes. \"But Jack Smith's subpoena was neither politically motivated nor designed to strengthen President Biden's political hand in 2024. Thus the jarring dissonance between the subpoena and Mr. Pence's characterization of it. It is Mr. Pence who has chosen to politicize the subpoena, not the D.O.J.\"  ", "The former judge goes on to say that Pence's plan to fight the subpoena risks a political backlash.

", "\"One of the things that we are working hard at - at President Biden's direction - is to increase the production of all of these types of ammunition,\" Sullivan said. \"This is not something we can do with the snap of a finger, but it's something that we are putting immense effort and resources into.\"   ", "Sullivan told Zakaria that the US has provided Ukraine with the assistance it needs for each phase of the war since it began one year ago.  ", "But he also acknowledged that the Ukrainians have often asked for more than the US is willing to give - though in many cases the Biden administration has eventually transferred weapons it had initially resisted sending.

F-16s are a question for the long-term defense of Ukraine and that's a conversation that President Biden and President Zelensky had,\" Sullivan said.

Biden agreed to provide Abrams tanks to Ukraine - which the US has argued aren't as relevant as German Leopard tanks - because Germany wanted the US to provide tanks before it was willing to do so itself, he said.

Ukraine wasn't attacking Russia, NATO wasn't attacking Russia, the United States wasn't attacking Russia.

But are you saying that American is incapable of also helping to serve as a powerful force of good in the world?\" Sullivan said.

", "In seeking to block DOJ's access to Perry's phone, his lawyers have pointed specifically to a 2007 ruling concerning an FBI search of then-Rep. William Jefferson's congressional office in a bribery probe. The DC Circuit said that the Justice Department ran afoul of the constitutional clause by sorting through the Louisiana Democrat's files without his consent.   ", "Chief Judge Beryl Howell, however, ruled under seal that in Perry's case, some of the communications on Perry's phones wouldn't fall under his legislative work because they weren't sanctioned by any legislative authority. She said that investigators could access certain materials on Perry's phone that his lawyers had argued should be withheld. Howell's ruling did, however, allow Perry to protect some of his phone contents under the Speech or Debate Clause, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.  ", "To make her decision, Howell confidentially reviewed details about the information that was on Perry's phone that the Justice Department sought, the source said. Prosecutors still haven't gotten access to the more than 2,000 records they seek.    ", "The DC Circuit Court of Appeals above Howell has put on hold her rulings, including investigators' ability to access Perry's phone records, as it hears arguments in the case on a much-quicker-than-usual timeline.   ", "On Thursday, Perry's attorney said that his circumstances were parallel to the 2007 case, with the difference being this search is of a cell phone instead of an office.  ", "The judges, however, asked Rowley whether the immunity applies once a lawmaker speaks to parties outside of Congress - and questioned whether that could theoretically cover all kinds of communications of a member of Congress using a cell phone.  ", "\"It's not the cell phone that makes this odd, it's that the communication can be to anyone in the universe,\"  Katsas told Rowley.  ", "Circuit Judge Karen Henderson, the third member of the panel, participated in Thursday's hearing remotely. Henderson, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, was on the circuit panel in the William Jefferson case and wrote a concurrence that took a much narrower view of the Speech or Debate Clause than the one embraced by the other judges on that decision.  ", "The DC Circuit is also considering whether it has the authority to intervene at this point, but the judges asked the parties to focus on the other legal questions in the case when arguing on Thursday.  ", "The House - with the approval of both majority and minority leadership - has sought to weigh in on the case, in a sign of how the Perry litigation could set the rules for how the immunity applies to all sorts of lawmaker activity going forward. The House's filings, however, are not public.   ", "Spulak noted that, practically speaking, the role of a congressperson has become \"pretty broad\" over time and that their legislative duties can go beyond talking about a specific piece of legislation, \"since oversight is fundamental to the legislative process.\"   ", "In the Graham case, the US Supreme Court refused to block the Fulton County grand jury's subpoena for his testimony. The justices stressed that the lower courts that ordered his appearance had said that the Speech or Debate Clause precluded him from question about the \"informal investigative fact finding\" that was part of his legislative activity.  ", "The DC Circuit's consideration of the Perry case could flesh out what kind of informal fact-finding amounts to protected legislative activity.   ", "\"Depending on how broad you read what a legislative act is, it could permit members of Congress to really cover lots of their conduct within the speech or Debate Clause that I think we would generally not think would be covered,\" said Neil Eggleston, a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama.

I think sunshine lets everybody make their own judgment,\" he told the Times.  ", "McCarthy - who has already been fundraising on the move - did indeed promise to release the footage as part of his bid to become speaker, and it was something Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz had specifically been demanding. In fact, it was on a lengthy list of demands that Gaetz walked into McCarthy's office with on the Monday night before the speaker's vote, according to a GOP source familiar with the list.   ", "But the list did not say the footage needs to go to Carlson - that was decided later.    ", "McCarthy could have tasked his own committees with sorting through the footage and presenting it, but a source close to McCarthy said he has long been wary of having the House GOP looking like it is investigating or relitigating the January 6 attack.   ", "Instead, McCarthy opted to give the footage to a friendly conservative media network. Specifically, he opted to give the exclusive to Carlson, who has been one of the most vocal voices in conservative media calling for the footage to be released. Carlson has been a huge McCarthy critic - so this move could help win the speaker some favor with Carlson's camp as McCarthy tries to hold together both the conservative and moderate wings of his Republican conference.  ", "McCarthy is hoping that outsourcing this work to the media will be a way to appease his right flank without upsetting his moderates and majority makers.   ", "But it's a still a big risk, and McCarthy and House Republicans could still wind up taking the blame for however this plays out in the media. Already, Democrats have been quick to criticize the move by McCarthy, warning that it creates a significant security risk.  ", "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday blasted McCarthy in a letter to his Senate colleagues - comments that marked the first time Schumer has spoken out about the move. Schumer said in the letter that, \"the speaker is needlessly exposing the Capitol complex\" and that the disclosure \"poses grave security risks to members of Congress and everyone who works on Capitol Hill.\"  ", "In the letter, Schumer said McCarthy's decision to give the footage to Carlson \"laid bare that this sham is simply about pandering to MAGA election deniers, not the truth.\"  ", "Carlson has been one of the most prominent promoters of January 6 conspiracy theories. Most notably, he has devoted significant airtime to the false claim that liberal \"deep state\" partisans within the FBI orchestrated the insurrection as a way to undermine former President Donald Trump. He has conducted sympathetic interviews with some of the rioters who were subsequently charged by the Justice Department.  ", "After more than a dozen news outlets, including CNN, sued for access to the videos in 2021, the chief judge of DC federal court ruled that the public has a strong interest in seeing some security footage from the attack. However, these video releases haven't been automatic or guaranteed. News outlets can request the public release of videos after they are played in open court, on a case-by-case basis.
