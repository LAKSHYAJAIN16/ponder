LGBTQ advocates and their supporters have said that targeting the care could have dire consequences for a vulnerable group that suffers from uniquely high rates of suicide.

DeSantis hosted his own donor gathering in Palm Beach last weekend that was aimed at addressing those concerns.

I don't think it's good for our economy,\" the governor said. \"I don't think it's good for society to have every decision that's made in politics have corporate America weighing in.\"  ", "Some Republicans have bristled at DeSantis' heavy-handed use of executive power to impose his ideology on private businesses. His moves to punish Disney for speaking out against a Florida measure to restrict certain lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in schools has especially attracted criticism from the right. Several potential 2024 rivals, including Pence and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, have seized on DeSantis' top-down governing style to draw sharp contrasts with the popular governor.  ", "DeSantis on Thursday dismissed the criticism from people who \"claim to be on the right.\"  ", "\"Republicans need to not shy away from these fights just because the media and the left are going to call you names,\" he said.  ", "Ahead of DeSantis' upcoming visit this weekend to California, where he'll appear at the Reagan Library and also deliver a speech at a fundraiser for the Orange County Republican Party, he took a shot at the state's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, for being \"preoccupied\" with DeSantis and Florida.  ", "Newsom often posts criticism of DeSantis on social media and this past July 4, he took to the Sunshine State's airwaves, paying $105,000 to run an ad on Fox News in Florida that declared, \"Freedom is under attack in your state.\"   ", "\"Literally, how many other governors does anyone even care about? I mean, when you go to California, they got all these problems there. Their governor's preoccupied with me and what we're doing in Florida. ... It's incredible,\" DeSantis said Thursday. \"And honestly, I just know that game. If they're not shooting that means you're not getting anything done. That they're coming after me because I'm standing up for the people that I represent. I view that as positive reinforcement.\"  ", "DeSantis also spoke at length about his recent legislation giving him more control over Disney's special tax district, and described the entertainment giant's management as caving in to \"woke ideology.\"  ", "\"I believe woke ideology is pernicious. I believe what's at stake is not just 'My policies are good,'\" he said. \"We should not all be suffering under the cloak of wokeness. ... This issue with Disney is a good example of that. ... They were basically a law unto themselves, and they got away with it for a long time because they were so powerful. They were the 800-pound gorilla, but they made the mistake of trying to stick their nose into sensitive matters involving children, involving education, and involving family.\"  ", "DeSantis also went into detail about stacking Florida's school boards with conservatives and his plan to fight \"critical race theory\" in schools.

And China increasingly tends to view its global interests through the prism of its standoff with the US, so it may perceive an advantage in Washington being locked in an arms-length conflict in Ukraine that is costing billions of dollars and to which it is sending reserve military equipment and ammunition that can therefore not be used to bolster its Pacific forces.

", "Yet a decision by China to throw in its lot with Russia in Ukraine would amount to a radical change in foreign policy - and another massive plunge in US-China relations.

", "During the 2012 vice-presidential debate, Biden engaged in a nearly 11-minute exchange with GOP nominee Paul Ryan over Republican plans to reconfigure the two massive programs for the elderly, several of which Ryan had authored himself.   ", "Biden and many Democrats felt he had won the argument on stage. Yet on Election Day, Ryan and GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney routed Biden and President Barack Obama among White seniors, and beat them soundly among seniors overall, exit polls found.   ", "That outcome underscores the obstacles facing Biden now as he tries to recapture older voters by portraying Republicans as threats to the two towers of America's safety net for the elderly. While polls consistently show that voters trust Democrats more than Republicans to safeguard the programs, GOP presidential nominees have carried all seniors in every presidential election back to 2004 and have reached at least 58% support among White seniors in each of the past four contests, exit polls have found. Democrats have likewise consistently struggled among those nearing retirement, older working adults aged 45-64.   ", "Those results suggest that for most older voters, affinity for the GOP messages on other issues - particularly its resistance, in the Donald Trump era, to cultural and racial change - has outweighed their views about Social Security and Medicare. Those grooves are now cut so deeply, over so many elections, that Biden may struggle to change them much no matter how hard he rails against a range of GOP proposals that could retrench or restructure the programs.  ", "Biden's charge that Republicans are threatening the two giant entitlement programs for the elderly - which triggered his striking back and forth exchanges with GOP legislators during the State of the Union - fits squarely in his broader political positioning as he turns toward his expected reelection campaign.  ", "As I've written, the 80-year-old Biden, at his core, \"remains something like a pre-1970s Democrat, who is most comfortable with a party focused less on cultural crusades than on delivering kitchen-table benefits to people who work with their hands.\" As president he's expressed that inclination primarily through what he calls his \"blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America\" - the planks in his economic plans, such as generous incentives to revive domestic manufacturing, aimed at creating more opportunity for workers without a college degree. Politically, Biden's staunch defense of Social Security and Medicare, programs critical to the economic security of financially vulnerable retirees, represents a logical bookend to that emphasis.  ", "\"We all know that whose side you are on is a critical debate point for every election and this debate over Social Security and Medicare really helps crystallize whose side Biden is on versus whose side Republicans are on in a very effective way for him,\" said Democratic pollster Matt Hogan, who helped conduct an extensive series of bipartisan polls during the 2022 campaign measuring attitudes among seniors for the AARP, the giant lobby for the elderly.  ", "From Franklin Roosevelt through Hubert Humphrey and Tip O'Neill, generations of Democrats have framed themselves as the defenders of the social safety net for seniors against Republicans who they say would unravel it. Biden showed how comfortable he was stepping into those shoes during his 2012 vice-presidential debate with Ryan, then a young representative from Wisconsin who Romney had selected as his running mate.  ", "Nearly 30 years Biden's junior, Ryan was an unflinching advocate of restructuring Social Security and Medicare to reduce costs over time. In particular, Ryan was the principal supporter of a conservative plan to convert Medicare, the giant federal health insurance program for the elderly, into a system called \"premium support.\" Under that proposal, Medicare would be transformed from its current structure, in which the government directly pays doctors and hospitals who provide care for beneficiaries, into a voucher (or \"premium support\") system, in which the government would provide recipients a fixed sum to purchase private insurance. Ryan had also drafted proposals to partially privatize Social Security by allowing workers to divert part of their payroll taxes into private investment accounts, a change that would have reduced the tax dollars flowing into the system and eventually required substantial cuts in guaranteed benefits.  ", "For nearly 11 minutes during the debate in October 2012, moderator Martha Raddatz of ABC skillfully guided Biden and Ryan through a heated, but civil and substantive, discussion of Social Security and Medicare's future. Ryan insisted that changes were needed to preserve the programs' long-term viability and that current seniors and those near retirement would not see their benefits reduced.  ", "Biden appealed openly to the Democrats' historic image as the programs' protectors and condemned Ryan and the GOP for wanting to partially privatize them. At one point in the debate, Biden declared: \"we will be no part of a [Medicare] voucher program or the privatization of Social Security.\" A few moments later, he insisted: \"These guys haven't been big on Medicare from the beginning. And they've always been about Social Security as little as you can do. Look, folks, use your common sense. Who do you trust on this?\"  ", "At the time, Democrats felt Biden had at least held his own, restoring the party's momentum after Obama's surprisingly listless performance eight days earlier in his first debate against Romney. And Democrats through the rest of the campaign railed against the Republican ticket as a threat to Social Security and Medicare.  ", "But on election day, those arguments did not translate into gains for Obama and Biden among seniors or the older working adults (aged 45-64) nearing retirement. As Hogan noted, the newly passed Affordable Care Act, which generated some of its funding through savings in Medicare, was extremely unpopular at the time among older voters. Obama and Biden not only lost seniors and the older working age adults, but actually ran slightly more poorly among both groups in 2012 than they did in 2008.  ", "In fact, no Democratic presidential nominee since Al Gore in 2000 has carried most seniors in a presidential campaign; Obama in 2008 was the only one since Gore to carry most of the older working age adults. Among older Whites, the Democratic deficit is even more pronounced: the Republican presidential nominee has carried around three-fifths of both White seniors and those nearing retirement in each of the past four elections. Biden in 2020 slightly improved on Hillary Clinton's anemic 2016 performance with both groups, but still lost to Trump by 15 percentage points among White seniors and by 23 points among the Whites nearing retirement, according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. Biden performed especially poorly among older Whites without a college degree - an economically stressed group heavily reliant on the federal retirement programs.  ", "Estimates by Catalist, a Democratic targeting firm, and the Pew Research Center likewise found that Trump in both 2016 and 2020 beat his Democratic opponents among both seniors and the older working adults. Like the exit polls, the Catalist data show the Republican nominees carrying about three-fifths of White seniors and older working adults in each of the past three presidential elections.  ", "The story is similar in congressional contests. In House elections, the exit polls found Republicans winning all seniors and older working adults comfortably in the 2014 and 2022 midterm campaigns and narrowly carrying them even in 2018 when Democrats romped overall. In all three of those midterm congressional elections, Republicans carried about three-fifths of the near retirement White adults, while they also reached that elevated threshold among White seniors in both the 2014 and 2022 campaigns.  ", "Republicans have maintained these advantages with older voters despite polls showing that most Americans trust Democrats more than the GOP to protect Social Security and Medicare, and that most Americans, especially seniors, oppose the intermittently surfacing GOP proposals to partially privatize both programs.  ", "Politically, \"Democrats have used Social Security and Medicare really a lot over the past two or three decades, maybe four decades,\" said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. \"The payoff has been a lot less than Democrats have generally thought it would be.\"  ", "Could this time be different for Biden and the Democrats? Congressional Republicans have certainly provided plenty of evidence for his claim that they still hope to restructure the programs. The proposed 2023 budget by the Republican Study Committee, the members of which include about three-fourths of House Republicans, reprises the ideas of converting Medicare into a premium support system and establishing private investment accounts under Social Security, while also raising the retirement age for both programs and reducing Social Security benefits over time. And although Florida Sen. Rick Scott renounced the idea late last week, his \"Rescue America\" agenda did include a proposal to require Congress to reauthorize all federal programs, including Social Security and Medicare, every five years.  ", "These ideas have precipitated an unusual degree of open Republican dissension. Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell repeatedly, and unreservedly, denounced the Scott plan until the Florida senator backed off. Trump recently released a video in which he declared the GOP should not cut \"a single penny\" of Social Security or Medicare benefits - which put him directly at odds with the three-fourths of House Republicans in the Republican Study Committee. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, bending more toward Trump's position, seems unlikely to incorporate into the GOP budget plans the RSC's most sweeping changes in Social Security and Medicare.  ", "Kessler believes Biden may succeed where other Democrats have failed at hurting the GOP with the issue, and he argued that the conspicuous Republican infighting demonstrates they share that concern. \"We are watching a high-profile battle that I've never really seen before on these issues in the Republican Party,\" Kessler said. \"And part of it is clearly they think it's a problem when they didn't years ago. If they think it's a problem, maybe it's a problem.\"  ", "Stuart Stevens, who served as Romney's chief strategist in the 2012 campaign but has since become a fierce critic of the Trump-era GOP, also believes the party could face more risk over its entitlement agenda than it did back then. The reason is that he thinks the idea of sunsetting Social Security and Medicare every five years, even if Scott is trying to jettison it, may prove more immediately tangible and understandable to voters than Ryan's complex ideas of partially privatizing both programs.   ", "\"The question I always ask myself in campaigns is 'are you talking about something the other side doesn't want to talk about?'\" Stevens said. \"That's probably a good sign that they are losing on the issue.\"  ", "Whether Biden proves more effective than other recent Democrats at attracting older voters around Social Security and Medicare will likely pivot on whether seniors believe the GOP genuinely would cut the programs if given the power to do so, argued Robert Blendon, a professor emeritus at the Harvard School of Public Health, who specializes in public attitudes about the social safety net. \"If the senior community actually believes that it's being threatened it really would affect their votes,\" he predicted. But, he added, \"as long as they are not threatened, the other values of seniors on top issues more and more correspond with Republicans.\"  ", "There's no doubt about the second half of that equation. Polling has consistently found that older Whites, in particular, are more receptive than their younger counterparts to hardline Trump-era GOP messages around crime, immigration and the broader currents of racial and cultural change: for instance, about half of Whites older than 50 agree that discrimination against Whites is now as big a problem as bias against minorities, a far higher percentage than among younger Whites, according to a new national survey by the Public Religion Research Institute. Older Whites are also more likely than younger generations to lack a college degree or to identify as Christians, attributes that generally predict sympathy for GOP cultural and racial arguments.  ", "Through the 21st century, those cultural and racial attitudes among older White voters have consistently trumped any concerns they may hold about the Republican commitment to Social Security and Medicare. Despite Biden's impassioned articulation of the case against the GOP, that didn't change even in 2012 when Republicans placed on their national ticket a vice presidential nominee who directly embodied the GOP aspirations to reconfigure and retrench those programs.   ", "Even small changes in seniors' preferences could have a big impact in closely balanced states with a large retiree population like Arizona and Pennsylvania. But the entrenched GOP advantage among older voters over the past two decades suggests Biden's hopes in 2024 may pivot less on improving with the \"gray\" than maximizing his vote among the \"brown\": the diverse, younger generations that recoil from the same Republican messages on culture and race that electrify so many older Whites.

And it's because of the attack on faith. People are losing faith because, for some reason, because the attack [on] God.\"   ", "Facts First: Tuberville's claim that half of American children don't have two parents is incorrect.

While many Americans do struggle with reading, there is no basis for the claim that \"half\" of high school graduates can't read a basic document like a diploma. \"Mr. Tuberville does not know what he's talking about at all,\" said Patricia Edwards, a Michigan State University professor of language and literacy who is a past president of the International Literacy Association and the Literacy Research Association. Edwards said there is \"no evidence\" to support Tuberville's claim. She also said that people who can't read at all are highly unlikely to finish high school and that \"sometimes politicians embellish information.\"", "Tuberville could have accurately said that a significant number of American teenagers and adults have reading trouble, though there is no apparent basis for connecting these struggles with supposed \"woke\" indoctrination. The organization ProLiteracy pointed CNN to 2017 data that found 23% of Americans age 16 to 65 have \"low\" literacy skills in English. That's not \"half,\" as ProLiteracy pointed out, and it includes people who didn't graduate from high school and people who are able to read basic text but struggle with more complex literacy tasks.

Biden did not denounce even close to \"half the country\" in this 2022 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.  He made clear that he was speaking about a minority of Republicans.", "In the speech, in which he never used the word \"fascists,\" Biden warned that \"MAGA Republicans\" like Trump are \"extreme,\" \"do not respect the Constitution\" and \"do not believe in the rule of law.\" But he also emphasized that \"not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans.\" In other words, he made clear that he was talking about far less than half of Americans.   ", "Trump earned fewer than 75 million votes in 2020 in a country of more than 258 million adults, so even a hypothetical criticism of every single Trump voter would not amount to criticism of \"half the country.\"  ", "Rep. Scott Perry claimed that \"average citizens need to just at some point be willing to acknowledge and accept that every single facet of the federal government is weaponized against every single one of us.\" Perry said moments later, \"The government doesn't have the right to tell you that you can't buy a gas stove but that you must buy an electric vehicle.\"   ", "Facts First: This is nonsense. The federal government has not told people that they can't buy a gas stove or must buy an electric vehicle. ", "The Biden administration has tried to encourage and incentivize the adoption of electric vehicles, but it has not tried to forbid the manufacture or purchase of traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines. Biden has set a goal of electric vehicles making up half of all new vehicles sold in the US by 2030.  ", "There was a January controversy about a Biden appointee to the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, Richard Trumka Jr., saying that gas stoves pose a \"hidden hazard,\" as they emit air pollutants, and that \"any option is on the table. Products that can't be made safe can be banned.\" But the commission as a whole has not shown support for a ban, and White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a January press briefing: \"The president does not support banning gas stoves. And the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which is independent, is not banning gas stoves.\"   ", "Rep. Ralph Norman claimed that Biden had just laughed at a mother who lost two sons to fentanyl.

Who cares where it came from? The fact is it's here,\" Norman said.   ", "Facts First: Norman's claim is false. Biden did not laugh at the mother who lost her sons to fentanyl, the anti-abortion activist Rebecca Kiessling; in a somber tone, he called her \"a poor mother who lost two kids to fentanyl.\" Rather, he proceeded to laugh about how Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene had baselessly blamed the Biden administration for the young men's deaths even though the tragedy happened in mid-2020, during the Trump administration. You can watch the video of Biden's remarks here. ", "Kiessling has demanded an apology from Biden. She is entitled to her criticism of Biden's remarks and his chuckle - but the video clearly shows Norman was wrong when he claimed Biden was \"laughing at the mother.\"  ", "Rep. Kat Cammack told a story about the first hearing of the new Republican-led House select subcommittee on the supposed \"weaponization\" of the federal government. Cammack claimed she had asked a Democratic witness at this February hearing about his \"incredibly vitriolic\" Twitter feed in which, she claimed, he not only repeatedly criticized Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh but even went \"so far as to encourage people to harass this Supreme Court justice.\"   ", "Facts First: This story is false. The witness Cammack questioned in this February exchange at the subcommittee, former Obama administration deputy assistant attorney general Elliot Williams, did not encourage people to harass Kavanaugh. In fact, it's not even true that Cammack accused him at the February hearing of having encouraged people to harass Kavanaugh. Rather, at the hearing, she merely claimed that Williams had tweeted numerous critical tweets about Kavanaugh but had been \"unusually quiet\" on Twitter after an alleged assassination attempt against the justice. Clearly, not tweeting about the incident is not the same thing as encouraging harassment. ", "Williams, now a CNN legal analyst (he appeared at the subcommittee hearing in his personal capacity), said in a Thursday email that he had \"no idea\" what Cammack was looking at on his innocuous Twitter feed. He said: \"I used to prosecute violent crimes, and clerked for two federal judges. Any suggestion that I've ever encouraged harassment of anyone - and particularly any official of the United States - is insulting and not based in reality.\"  ", "Cammack's spokesperson responded helpfully on Thursday to CNN's initial queries about the story Cammack told at CPAC, explaining that she was referring to her February exchange with Williams. But the spokesperson stopped responding after CNN asked if Cammack was accurately describing this exchange with Williams and if they had any evidence of Williams actually having encouraged the harassment of Kavanaugh.   ", "Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana boasted about the state of the country \"when Republicans were in charge.\" Among other claims about Trump's tenure, he said that \"in four years,\" Republicans \"delivered 3.5% unemployment\" and \"created 8 million new jobs.\"   ", "Facts First: This is inaccurate in two ways. First, the economic numbers for the full \"four years\" of Trump's tenure are much worse than these numbers Kennedy cited; Kennedy was actually referring to Trump's first three years while ignoring the fourth, which was marred by the Covid-19 pandemic. Second, there weren't \"8 million new jobs\" created even in Trump's first three years.", "Kennedy could have correctly said there was a 3.5% unemployment rate after three years of the Trump administration, but not after four. The unemployment rate skyrocketed early in Trump's fourth year, on account of the pandemic, before coming down again, and it was 6.3% when Trump left office in early 2021. (It fell to 3.4% this January under Biden, better than in any month under Trump.)  ", "And while the economy added about 6.7 million jobs under Trump before the pandemic-related crash of March and April 2020, that's not the \"8 million jobs\" Kennedy claimed - and the economy ended up shedding millions of jobs in Trump's fourth year. Over the full four years of Trump's tenure, the economy netted a loss of about 2.7 million jobs.  ", "Lara Trump, Donald Trump's daughter-in-law and an adviser to his 2020 campaign, claimed that the last time a CPAC crowd was gathered at this venue in Maryland, in February 2020, \"We had the lowest unemployment in American history.\" After making other boasts about Donald Trump's presidency, she said, \"But how quickly it all changed.\" She added, \"Under Joe Biden, America is crumbling.\"   ", "Facts First: Lara Trump's claim about February 2020 having \"the lowest unemployment in American history\" is false. The unemployment rate was 3.5% at the time - tied for the lowest since 1969, but not the all-time lowest on record, which was 2.5% in 1953. And while Lara Trump didn't make an explicit claim about unemployment under Biden, it's not true that things are worse today on this measure; again, the most recent unemployment rate, 3.4% for January 2023, is better than the rate at the time of CPAC's 2020 conference or at any other time during Donald Trump's presidency. ", "Multiple speakers at CPAC decried the high number of fentanyl overdose deaths. But some of the speakers inflated that number while attacking Biden's immigration policy.   ", "Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump administration official, claimed that \"in the last 12 months in America, deaths by fentanyl poisoning totaled 110,000 Americans.\" He blamed \"Biden's open border\" for these deaths.   ", "Rep. Scott Perry claimed: \"Meanwhile over on this side of the border, where there isn't anybody, they're running this fentanyl in; it's killing 100,000 Americans - over 100,000 Americans - a year.\"   ", "Facts First: It's not true that there are more than 100,000 fentanyl deaths per year. That is the total number of deaths from all drug overdoses in the US; there were 106,699 such deaths in 2021. But the number of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone, primarily fentanyl, is smaller - 70,601 in 2021. ", "Fentanyl-related overdoses are clearly a major problem for the country and by far the biggest single contributor to the broader overdose problem. Nonetheless, claims of \"110,000\" and \"over 100,000\" fentanyl deaths per year are significant exaggerations. And while the number of overdose deaths and fentanyl-related deaths increased under Biden in 2021, it was also troubling under Trump in 2020 - 91,799 total overdose deaths and 56,516 for synthetic opioids other than methadone.   ", "It's also worth noting that fentanyl is largely smuggled in by US citizens through legal ports of entry rather than by migrants sneaking past other parts of the border. Contrary to frequent Republican claims, the border is not \"open\"; border officers have seized thousands of pounds of fentanyl under Biden.

The move to remove power from Disney comes nearly a year after the company spoke out against a Florida bill - which DeSantis later signed into law - to restrict certain classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity.

You know, and so, maybe that's a part of it.\"    ", "\"But the big part I would suggest to you, based upon what it's saying here, is the removal of constraint,\" he continued. \"So our society provided the constraint. And so, which is the responsibility of a society to constrain people from doing evil? Well, you remove the constraints, and then evil occurs.\"   ", "Testosterone levels in men have dropped in recent decades, and researchers are unsure why, but the drop is not 50%, and there is no indication that a drop in testosterone affects sexual orientation. Likewise, there is no evidence that estrogen in the water supply, for which birth control pills account for a statistically insignificant amount, affects sexual orientation. The claim that chemicals in tap water could turn people gay has gained ground with conspiracy theorists over the years, most memorably with fringe commentator Alex Jones, who said chemicals in the water were \"turning the friggin' frogs gay.\"   ", "In the same discussion, Peri called homosexuality \"shameful,\" linking it to disease.

That's a hell of a coincidence,\" Armstrong told CNN.

One whistleblower told CNN that some of them communicate over a group text chain and that many initially connected through a community of unvaccinated employees.    ", "Right-wing opinions about the January 6 attack appear to be a consistent throughline among the three individuals that have come forward so far.

", "The one individual charged with a misdemeanor of that group from Florida was at the Capitol on January 6 wearing a black gas mask, a tactical vest and a military-type helmet and goggles, according to court documents reviewed by CNN. One witness interviewed for the case claimed that the defendant had an AR-style rifle with him as well.    ", "Following his subcommittee interview, Friend told CNN he was suspended, in part, for raising concerns that the FBI was using \"unnecessary force.\"    ", "\"I compared it to using an elephant gun to kill a mouse,\" Friend, who officially resigned from the FBI on the day of his interview with committee staff, told CNN.   ", "Friend also told CNN that his concern with using a SWAT team would contribute to the illusion that \"half the country are potentially domestic terrorists\" and therefore prevent people from participating \"in a political dialogue.\"    ", "Friend admitted in the subcommittee interview that owning a gun or being accused of a felony crime were reasons for FBI management to consider using a SWAT team, according to transcripts reviewed by CNN.  ", "After Friend was suspended for refusing to help in the case, he filed a whistleblower complaint to the Justice Department inspector general on September 21, 2022. He also filed a claim with the US Office of Special Counsel, the function of which is to protect federal employees making whistleblower complaints.   ", "Friend's claim was eventually rejected by both entities.    ", "\"We cannot find with a substantial likelihood that the agency has violated a law, rule, or regulation or has abused its authority. Therefore, we will take no further action on this matter,\" the November 10, 2022, OSC report read, according to a copy reviewed by CNN.   ", "On December 2, 2022, the DOJ inspector general declined to open an investigation into the claims Friend raised. Friend is still waiting for the OIG to render a decision about his claims that the FBI retaliated against him.   ", "US law creates specific requirements for those who say they have been retaliated against for their claims. An individual must make a disclosure to the special counsel, to an inspector general or to Congress that provides evidence of any violation of \"any rule, law or regulation\" or \"gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.\"     ", "Friend is now a senior fellow at the Center for Renewing America, a policy shop run by former Trump administration officials.

The FBI is required to follow established policies and procedures, to include a thorough investigation, when suspending or revoking a security clearance. FBI employees who report evidence of wrongdoing through a protected disclosure are protected from retaliation.\"   ", " Judiciary committee staff have also interviewed a former FBI analyst who retired in October 2021 named George Hill, who supervised intelligence analysts that provided support to less than a dozen cases related to January 6.   ", "In his interview with the subcommittee Hill criticized a bank that he says shared with the FBI records of people who were in DC on January 6, according to transcripts reviewed by CNN.  When pressed, Hill said he simply saw a record listed in Sentinel, the FBI's case management system, and that he did not open it, according to the transcript.  ", "As part of its investigation into the January 6 attack at the Capitol, the FBI collected financial, communications and other business records of people investigated for possible crimes related to the Capitol riot. It's a routine investigative tool used to help investigators and prosecutors gather evidence. Bank transactions could be used to show travel and location of suspected rioters, and could be used to establish the purchase of weapons used in the attacks on police protecting the Capitol.   ", "Hill also raised concerns about a request that he says the Washington, DC, FBI field office made to the Boston field office to open preliminary investigations into two buses of people that traveled into DC on January 6. In his interview with the committee, Hill said he was told about the request, sources familiar with his testimony told CNN. Hill said there were concerns about violating people's First Amendment protected activity, the transcript read.  ", "Pullen said in a statement to CNN, \"the FBI's policy is to neither confirm nor deny the existence of investigations, however, the FBI will never open an investigation based solely on First Amendment protected activity,\" when asked about the claim of an investigation being opened into those buses.  ", "Hill has previously raised some of his claims on a podcast and in an interview with \"Just the News.\"", "Hill's interview covered tweets he made concerning the January 6 attack, a number of which have since been deleted, according to the transcript reviewed by CNN.   ", "On December 28, 2022, for example, Hill tweeted, \"insurrection my a$$. It was a set up and sadly, there's no shortage of idiots willing to take the bait.\" The comment was retweeting a post that read \"patriots were the ONLY ones trying to STOP the Fake Insurrection violence being committed by Implanted Antifa (Pelosi's buddies).\"   ", "Hill claimed he had a First Amendment right to make this statement when asked about it during his subcommittee interview, according to the transcript reviewed by CNN.   ", "In response to CNN, Empower Oversight, which represented Hill during his committee interview, said, \"All of these questions were asked and answered at the committee interview with Mr. Hill. We would encourage you to wait until the full, official transcript is available before reporting based on selective, partisan leaks.\"  ", "The third whistleblower interviewed by the subcommittee is suspended FBI agent Garret O'Boyle, who says he was suspended for making an unauthorized media disclosure. During his interview with subcommittee staff, O'Boyle, who worked out of the FBI's Wichita field office, would not elaborate on the claim or provide his suspension notice. When asked about his allegations against the FBI, O'Boyle said they were confidential and that he would not turn them over to House Democrats, according to sources familiar with his testimony.   ", "During the interview, O'Boyle's attorney Jesse Binnall told committee staff that O'Boyle's allegations were \"confidential by statute\" and that he had advised his client \"to not disclose exactly what was disclosed,\" according to a transcript reviewed by CNN.  ", "In response to questions from CNN, Binnall said, \"The confidential information he provided to Congress was done so with discretion, as provided for by law. He did not release that information to Democrats on the committee because he knew that they would leak it to the media.\"  ", "Binnall, a former Trump campaign attorney, told CNN that O'Boyle \"is a whistleblower on extremely serious government misconduct and unlawful retaliation. He provided that information to people who would take it seriously.\"  ", "In his Twitter bio, O'Boyle lists himself as a \"Congressional Whistleblower.\"  ", "In his interview with the subcommittee, O'Boyle claimed that in the wake of the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade last year, the FBI shifted a threat tag that addressed threats to Supreme Court justices to focus on abortion-rights opponents, according to the transcript reviewed by CNN. When pressed by Democrats, O'Boyle said he did not know that the FBI had arrested two individuals associated with attacks on pregnancy centers set up by abortion-rights opponents, but he was aware that it had offered a $25,000 reward for information regarding these pregnancy centers being vandalized, the transcript read.  ", "O'Boyle also said he had a domestic terrorism case that the FBI instructed him to treat as four different cases, a move O'Boyle claimed was made in order to inflate the number of domestic terrorism cases, according to the transcript.   ", "In a statement to CNN, the FBI said, \"we do not conduct investigations based on a person's political or social views\" and added that threat tags are \"merely a statistical tool to track information for review and reporting.\" In response to O'Boyle's claim about treating four cases as one, the FBI said \"any assertion that the FBI manipulates statistics on domestic terrorism cases is categorically false.\"  ", "O'Boyle told subcommittee staff that the Washington, DC, office had pressured him to take steps on a case pertaining to January 6, and that they had backed off when he said he didn't want to, sources familiar with his testimony told CNN.  ", "O'Boyle also claimed during his subcommittee interview that former Trump national security and defense official Kash Patel had been helping with his legal fees, according to the transcript reviewed by CNN. Patel remains a close associate of former President Donald Trump. He was the former president's representative to the National Archives and has testified before a federal grand jury investigating the handling of records taken to the former president's Mar-a-Lago home and resort.   ", "After O'Boyle said Patel was paying his legal fees, Binnall told the subcommittee that unbeknownst to his client he was working pro bono, according to the transcript.   ", "Patel is also helping the other whistleblower Friend, who testified to the subcommittee that Patel gifted him $5,000 in November 2022 after learning about his claims. Friend also said Patel connected him to the Center for Renewing America. Patel is listed as a senior fellow for national security and intelligence on the group's website.
