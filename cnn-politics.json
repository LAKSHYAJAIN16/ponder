Yet he acknowledged it probably would have helped the residents in East Palestine to see one of the better-known political figures in the country there to show them that they were being heard, even if no previous transportation secretaries toured derailment sites.

Buttigieg didn't get a single question on it.  ", "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, has praised the cooperation he's been getting from the Biden administration. No one has been able to point to a clear failure on Buttigieg's part around the train derailment, including House Oversight Chairman Rep. Jim Comer, whose initial letter demanding answers from the secretary cited issues with the National Transportation Safety Board, which is an independent agency - prompting Buttigieg to respond, \"it's hard to believe this is motivated by an interest in the finer points of transportation policy when its authors make abundantly clear that they don't even know how transportation policy works.\"  ", "No previous Transportation secretary had gone to a derailment site, so when he made his analysis he didn't think he would either.

EPA head Michael Regan is the one whose agency has actually taken the lead on the response to the East Palestine derailment - including signing off on the since-questioned decision to do a controlled burn of some of the hazardous materials - but few in Washington or beyond could pick him out of a crowd.

What's Buttigieg going to do next?' We've talked. What he's going to do next is be Secretary of Transportation.\"   ", "Buttigieg says what he'd rather be doing is trips like Monday's: Opening the first new airport terminal in Kansas City since Vice President Spiro Agnew was there for a ribbon cutting - Buttigieg arrived late, courtesy of being stuck on his own delayed Southwest Airlines flight  - celebrating the groundbreaking on a record-busting $4 billion electric vehicle battery plant in DeSoto, Kansas, and talking transportation programs with students at the University of Missouri.   ", "Those events are the things Buttigieg thought he was signing up for with the Cabinet job along moments like when Missouri Gov. Mike Parsons - a Republican who has close to zero political alignment with Buttigieg - took time to fix his hair before a photo after they toured the new Kansas City International terminal, later pulling him in for a long private chat.   ", "\"There's always a political spin on a lot of things in the world nowadays that we see all the time.

", "With DOT tracking a sizable increase in flights being canceled last summer, he called in the CEOs of the 10 largest airlines and pressed them on stress testing their schedule and improving customer service.   ", "Instead of waiting the years it could have taken for new regulations to get through, he wrote the CEOs a letter. In two weeks, he told them, he was going to publish a chart of which airlines offered which compensation for cancellations - cover a meal? A hotel? Rebook the ticket automatically? There would be green checks and red Xs. He'd do interviews, more tweets like the ones breaking down the dollar value of bonus miles, to help people avoid getting ripped off.  ", "Before he did, seven of the airlines - including Southwest - announced their own guarantees. Two more have followed. He's already told the airlines he'll be publishing a similar chart next week about which offer seating for families to be together. Already, American Airlines announced on Tuesday plans to institute a new policy.   ", "Imagine, Buttigieg mused to CNN, how much worse the Southwest meltdown around New Year's would have been for customers if those guarantees hadn't been in writing already.   ", "When the 17,000 Southwest flights were canceled over just 10 days, thanks to the combination of a winter storm and an outdated crew scheduling system, Buttigieg was hammered again. Republicans attacked him for dodging the crisis. Progressives complained that he wasn't hitting the company with big enough fines, following a Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders call over the summer to ramp up the corporate pain. He was \"in the hot seat,\" or according to one chyron: \"Mayor Pete Leaves Southwest Customers Stranded.\"  ", "\"We're attacking the secretary over bad business decisions by an airline and things out of his control,\" said Texas Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat whose district includes Southwest headquarters and is home to many airline workers.   ", "Allred said his fellow Democrats pushing for higher fines underestimated the ripple effects which could have sparked mass layoffs - and would have torqued Buttigieg the other way.    ", "\"Play it out, if he had decided to make this the biggest issue in the world, it would appear political, because it's outside the scope of what we're used to seeing secretaries of transportation do,\" Allred said.   ", "Buttigieg pointed out that 2022 saw the highest amount of refunds returned to customers in DOT history, with $1 billion over his time as secretary.  ", "He has a long list of issues he says have continued to be top priorities as public attention faded, like the data sharing pilot program created in the wake of the 2021 supply chain crisis to integrate information between major retailers, trucking companies, shipping companies, ports and labor. Or his mediating a negotiation between cellphone companies eager to install 5G towers and the airlines worried those signals would interfere with old altimeters and make planes fall out of the sky.   ", "That's the sensibility Buttigieg says he wants to take as a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation this week to address derailment issues. Change the standards on brakes, he says, and change the rules on transporting hazardous materials. Otherwise, when people want to hold him responsible, the level of what he'll be able to do is come at a $4.3 billion company with fines capped at $225,000.   ", "Already, the DOT points to meetings Buttigieg had back in Washington with 12 unions calling for more attention to the lack of personal protective equipment for clean-up workers and the health problems they've been having, and a voluntary safety reporting system that all seven top railroad companies - including Norfolk Southern - are agreeing to at his urging.  ", "Asked what he believed holding him to account would be, Buttigieg said, \"I want to be able to say, 'We did everything within our power to hold Norfolk Southern accountable, that we made major strides in the level of rail safety and anything that the people of East Palestine came to us and needed, we addressed,'\" he said. \"All of those require being in it for the long haul.\"   ", "Being a lightning rod, Buttigieg knows, will make that harder. He pointed to an appearance he made last week at the National Association of Counties conference. The main topic he wanted to address was roadway deaths which kill 40,000 Americans per year, 100 per day, by his data.   ", "But the only attention he generated was a pile-on over a passing comment about how construction workers needed to diversify so they came from the neighborhoods in which they're working in.

", "Online, the response was huge: Both excited likes and vicious repetitions of standard attacks like on those boots he wore in Ohio  to his taking paternity leave after adopting twins in late 2021. In person at the airport opening ceremony, it was more muted, but Lucas felt that Republicans and Democrats, business leaders and union workers all seemed to feel a real connection to Buttigieg and want to talk with him.

Yet he offered a far more specific blueprint than Trump for a disruption of government as Americans know it, strongly implying that after implementing hardline conservatism in the Sunshine State, he could deliver the policy goals that often eluded Trump in his chaotic White House term.  ", "\"I can tell you in four years, you didn't see our administration leaking like a sieve, you didn't see a lot of drama or palace intrigue,\" said DeSantis, whose punch-by-punch speaking style is far more ordered and methodical than Trump's wild flights of rhetoric. \"What you saw was surgical, precision execution. Day after day after day. And because we did that, we beat the left day after day after day.\"  ", "The back-to-back speeches, which highlighted two Republicans who would be the early favorites if DeSantis gets into the GOP nominating race, came with a slice of irony. The split screen captured their party's unresolved ideological split that Trump engineered in 2016 when he crushed establishment candidates. CPAC, where Trump spoke, for decades kept alive the flame of the two-term president Reagan, who redefined the conservative movement when he won the 1980 election and left a legacy that dominated the GOP until Trump arrived. Once a rite of passage for potential GOP presidential candidates, CPAC has since become a platform for Trump's personality cult. DeSantis did not speak there, instead appearing last week at a dueling Club for Growth donor conference to which Trump was not invited.   ", "Speaking in the shadow of Reagan's former Air Force One on Sunday, DeSantis appeared to be staking a claim to both the reforming zeal of the 40th president and offering an updated, more targeted - yet still searing - version of Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" populism, although stripped of the uproarious distractions typical of the most recent Republican president. He seemed to be trying to build a conservative coalition that would appeal to Republicans who have soured on Trump after his record of two impeachments, a US Capitol insurrection and a disastrous intervention in the 2022 midterm elections, but that might also peel away some Trump supporters who still love their champion but doubt that he has the discipline and appeal needed to win a national election again.  ", "Still, if DeSantis were to win the Republican nomination, there would likely be questions over whether his own radicalism would hurt him in the same swing state districts where Trump lost the 2020 election - even notwithstanding a public persona that is more disciplined than Trump's. There's not much subtlety in his rhetoric about a \"woke mind virus\": Much of the Florida governor's phrasing comes with the implication that anyone who does not share his views is, by definition, a left-wing extremist. And he would essentially be promising Americans one of the most right-wing presidencies of modern history.  ", "DeSantis was not the only possible alternative to Trump who laid out his case in recent days. Former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who has already launched a campaign, and ex-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who may do so, both braved the lions' den at CPAC, and both launched veiled attacks on their former boss.  ", "\"If you're tired of losing, put your trust in a new generation,\" Haley said, playing into criticisms that both Trump, 76, and Biden, 80, should yield to younger leaders.   ", "Pompeo, who, like his former Cabinet colleague got a fairly tepid reception on the ex-president's turf, stacked his speech with plausible deniability to avoid taking on Trump directly. But one remark could be read as as much of a criticism of the ex-president as the Democrats he specifically targeted when he said: \"We can't become the left, following celebrity leaders with their own brand of identity politics, those with fragile egos who refuse to acknowledge reality.\"  ", "Another potential Republican candidate, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, was on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday and attacked Trump's fearsome culture war talk.  ", "\"If you want to heal our land and unite our country together, you don't do it by appealing to the angry mob,\" Hutchinson told Dana Bash.  ", "\"Wherever you're looking at the leader of our country, you don't want him to be engaged in a personal vendetta. And when he talks about vengeance, he's talking about his personal vendettas, and that's not healthy for America. It's certainly not healthy for our party.'  ", "One other potential anti-Trump GOP candidate, former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, however, announced on Sunday that he would pass on the 2024 race to avoid splintering the opposition to the ex-president.  ", "\"Right now, you have Trump and DeSantis at the top of the field soaking up all the oxygen, getting all the attention, and then a whole lot of the rest of us in single digits. And the more of them you have, the less chance you have for somebody rising up,\" Hogan told CBS News.  ", "If Hogan's reluctant decision to bow out foreshadows similar decisions by other long-shot candidates, it could point to a Republican nominating race that does not replicate the fracturing of the anti-Trump vote that helped his remarkable rise to power in 2016. John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser who is now a vociferous critic of his former boss, raised exactly this point during an appearance on \"CNN This Morning\" Monday, saying the Republican Party's focus should be on \"eliminating Trump from the nomination process as early as possible.\"  ", "But a slimmer candidacy field would also fuel the possibility of a long and bitter nominating race between Trump and DeSantis through a swathe of winner-take-all primaries - if the Florida governor decides to get into the race.  ", "Given his strong hold on the Republican base, Trump is likely to be seen as the favorite for the nomination, but he appears to recognize the potential threat he faces from DeSantis, and has already accused him of disloyalty after endorsing him in his first race for the governor's mansion in Tallahassee.   ", "But DeSantis, in his new book published last week, puts his success in that first gubernatorial campaign down to a \"massive swing\" powered by a strong Republican primary debate performance that took place after he won Trump's endorsement. And he is seeking to distinguish himself as a winner compared to Trump by citing his thumping reelection victory last fall, which stands in implicit contrast to the ex-president's national reelection loss.  ", "\"We went from winning by 32,000 votes in 2018 to winning by over 1.5 million votes in 2022. We earned the largest percentage of the vote that any Republican governor candidate received in Florida history,\" DeSantis said on Sunday.  ", "Yet the events of the weekend also pointed to some of the potential liabilities for DeSantis in any attempt to take down Trump. While his speech at the Reagan Library demonstrated a talent for explaining policy and a conversational style, he lacked the showmanship skills that Trump has long used to dominate Republican politics. Trumpism has always been more of a visceral and emotional backlash than an exercise in actually implementing ideological conservatism.   ", "Perhaps GOP voters are so keen to win back the presidency that they will look for a change. But in his speech at CPAC, which echoed the \"American Carnage\" themes of his inaugural address, Trump gave notice to DeSantis and the rest of the country that he will fight with everything he has to win the White House again. He told reporters that even if he is indicted in federal or state investigations against him, he will still not drop out of the race.  ", "\"At the end of the day, anyone else will be intimidated, bought off, blackmailed or ripped to shreds. I alone will never retreat,\" Trump said.

", "The reason was pretty clear: Much of the blame for the GOP's historical midterm underperformance for an opposition party was laid at Trump's feet. Many candidates he supported, including those who backed the falsehood that the 2020 election was illegitimate, lost winnable races.   ", "Due, in part, to the midterm results, Trump was no longer seen as the most electable Republican for 2024. A Marist College poll in mid-November found that just 35% of Republicans thought he gave them the best chance to take back the presidency. That was down from 50% in late 2021.   ", "DeSantis, meanwhile, could point to his nearly 20-point reelection victory in Florida last year as a sign of his electability.  ", "So what has turned it around for Trump so far in 2023?   ", "The most basic explanation is that he's been back on the campaign trail, while DeSantis has just been dancing around a bid for the presidency.   ", "Dominating the press coverage of the 2016 Republican primary campaign was key for Trump in crowding out his competitors.  ", "Since the start of the year, Trump has received more mentions on Fox News than he got immediately after the midterm elections. Meanwhile, DeSantis' mentions are down.

The percentage of Republicans who now think he represents their best shot to win in 2024 is back up to above 40% in Marist surveys.   ", "DeSantis has also had to deal with former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley declaring her bid for the presidency. The twice-elected South Carolina governor is polling a little better than she previously was (though still below 10%), but that only further divides the non-Trump vote.   ", "The question going forward is what happens if and when DeSantis formally announces a 2024 run?

That ... the most dangerous, the most concerning threat that they face on the counterterrorist side, and that is the threat from domestic violent extremists,\" McCabe said on \"CNN Newsroom.\" He added that such offenders were often \"motivated by racial animus, they're motivated by antisemitic feelings, by anti-immigrant feelings, charged sometimes with political grievance and then motivated to act violently on their own.\"   ", "Even without the antisemitic dimension, the alleged threats to Nessel and other officials are a fresh example of Michigan's problem with political hate and extremism, though the state is far from alone in seeing its officials exposed to intimidation.

The man's lawyers argued he had descended down a \"conspiracy rabbit hole\" during long solo trips as a truck driver. Another Democratic state official involved in election administration, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, has said armed protesters turned up outside her home to denounce her as a \"traitor\" in late 2020 when Trump was pushing lies about a stolen election in the critical swing state.  ", "Outside Michigan, two Georgia election officials testified last year to the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection how verbal attacks on them by Trump and his aides had ruined their lives, with one saying, \"There is nowhere I feel safe.\" In January, a Republican former candidate for New Mexico's legislature - who claimed there had been election fraud, according to police - was arrested on suspicion of orchestrating shootings that damaged the homes of Democratic elected leaders. And Paul Pelosi, the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is still recovering from a late October assault, allegedly by a man with a hammer who told police that Democrats had committed crimes against Trump, using rhetoric popular with the ex-president's supporters.

Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who now serves as House majority leader, was seriously injured in a shooting at a congressional baseball practice by a man claiming to be a Bernie Sanders supporter. And last year, police arrested a man near Brett Kavanaugh's home and charged him with attempting to murder the conservative Supreme Court justice.

She faces up to 10 years in prison when she is sentenced in July, according to the Justice Department.   ", "Each case is different, and individuals act on their own agency however they might be persuaded by heated political rhetoric. Politicians often use this to claim plausible deniability that their words caused violence. But the House January 6 committee aired video of Trump supporters on the day of the riot saying they were inspired by his false claims of election fraud. And a poll from The Washington Post and the University of Maryland in January 2022 found that 34% of Americans - and 41% of Republicans - think violent action against the government is sometimes justified.  ", "It is also undeniable that antisemitic attacks and violence and threats against public officials are coming at a time when the ex-president and his supporters have made false claims about stolen elections, which have been amplified by powerful media organizations like Fox News, even when - as emerged in court filings this week - the network's leaders knew those claims to be lies.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, who also has a record of spreading antisemitic material, showed up at a meeting on election integrity and berated Gabriel Sterling, a Republican election official from the Peach State who resisted Trump's baseless claims that he won the swing state in 2020. Greene fired off a flurry of claims and conspiracies for the cameras, which were almost all false.  ", "\"She came in late. She purposely sat next to me because she wanted to get her social media hits,\" Sterling told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday.

The filibuster is a custom that isn't mentioned in the Constitution, but has complete control over modern Washington and is leaving a vacuum for presidents to fill.

", "It would take two-thirds supermajorities in both chambers (usually 67 of 100 senators and 290 of 435 representatives) to override the expected veto.  ", "As for the second issue testing Biden, there had been talk that the president could veto a bill pushed by congressional Republicans to invalidate the DC city council's effort to rewrite its criminal law. Critics argue the new law is soft on violent criminals.   ", "But Biden told Democratic senators on Thursday that he won't use his veto power in this case and would sign the measure to repeal DC's new crime law. In a subsequent tweet, he noted, \"I support D.C. Statehood and home-rule - but I don't support some of the changes D.C. Council put forward over the Mayor's objections - such as lowering penalties for carjackings.\"  ", "Regardless, it took more than two years to get to this point, when a Republican-controlled House is testing Biden and a slim Democratic majority in the Senate is unable to protect him from pulling out his veto pen.

The Republican president was usually protected by a slim Republican majority in the Senate from legislation passed out of a House controlled by Democrats.  ", "The trend away from vetoes has carried through several presidents as use of the filibuster has increased.   ", "Trump threatened to veto lots of things, but he only ended up issuing 10. Just one of those - his veto of a bill to authorize defense spending - was overridden.   ", "Note: Read this explanation of the difference between a regular veto and a pocket veto. The latter occurs when a president simply declines to sign a bill and Congress goes into recess. But there hasn't been one of those in more than 22 years.

Bush was more than five years into his presidency before he issued his first veto, but there was a flurry of activity in his final two years, when he, like Obama, ultimately used his veto 12 items.

He was also overridden by lawmakers in order to avoid a slash in payments to Medicare providers.  ", "The first veto was issued by the first president after the first census. George Washington, a Southerner, opposed Congress' plan to reapportion congressional seats to each state by the state's population, which would have given more seats to Northern states.   ", "He issued the veto because the Constitution said there shouldn't be more than one lawmaker per 30,000 people, and the plan approved by Congress included eight states exceeding that ratio. Thomas Jefferson, who encouraged the veto, according to the National Archives, ultimately devised a new plan to apportion seats based on the population as a whole.  ", "The first master of the veto was Grover Cleveland, who cracked down on Congress' practice of acting to individually grant pensions to people who had been rejected by the Department of Veterans Affairs.   ", "Most presidents up to that point had issued either zero or a handful of vetoes. Cleveland, however, issued 414 vetoes during his first term. His most notable veto was to reject crop subsidies requested by Texas. Only two of his hundreds of vetoes were overridden during his first term. In total, across two terms, he issued more than 580 vetoes.  ", "Andrew Johnson, who ascended to the presidency after Abraham Lincoln's death, suffered the most veto overrides: 15. It makes sense since Johnson, a Southern Democrat, clashed with the Northern Republicans who controlled Capitol Hill at the time.  ", "The veto practice has fallen into general disuse for a number of reasons, according to Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, who has pointed out that for starters, Congress simply doesn't send as many bills to presidents as it used to.  ", "Rather than congressional committees writing bills, since the mid-'90s, when then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich squared off with then-President Bill Clinton, congressional leaders have taken over much of the process. That means there's more coordination between the White House and Capitol Hill when the same party is in control of both.

", "\"Many of the partisan, controversial measures die in the Senate before they can be sent to the president for signature or veto,\" Smith wrote in his newsletter in 2021. Presidents have also assumed more power from Congress, giving Congress less incentive to act.

", "Biden and many Democrats felt he had won the argument on stage. Yet on Election Day, Ryan and GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney routed Biden and President Barack Obama among White seniors, and beat them soundly among seniors overall, exit polls found.   ", "That outcome underscores the obstacles facing Biden now as he tries to recapture older voters by portraying Republicans as threats to the two towers of America's safety net for the elderly. While polls consistently show that voters trust Democrats more than Republicans to safeguard the programs, GOP presidential nominees have carried all seniors in every presidential election back to 2004 and have reached at least 58% support among White seniors in each of the past four contests, exit polls have found. Democrats have likewise consistently struggled among those nearing retirement, older working adults aged 45-64.   ", "Those results suggest that for most older voters, affinity for the GOP messages on other issues - particularly its resistance, in the Donald Trump era, to cultural and racial change - has outweighed their views about Social Security and Medicare. Those grooves are now cut so deeply, over so many elections, that Biden may struggle to change them much no matter how hard he rails against a range of GOP proposals that could retrench or restructure the programs.  ", "Biden's charge that Republicans are threatening the two giant entitlement programs for the elderly - which triggered his striking back and forth exchanges with GOP legislators during the State of the Union - fits squarely in his broader political positioning as he turns toward his expected reelection campaign.  ", "As I've written, the 80-year-old Biden, at his core, \"remains something like a pre-1970s Democrat, who is most comfortable with a party focused less on cultural crusades than on delivering kitchen-table benefits to people who work with their hands.\" As president he's expressed that inclination primarily through what he calls his \"blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America\" - the planks in his economic plans, such as generous incentives to revive domestic manufacturing, aimed at creating more opportunity for workers without a college degree. Politically, Biden's staunch defense of Social Security and Medicare, programs critical to the economic security of financially vulnerable retirees, represents a logical bookend to that emphasis.  ", "\"We all know that whose side you are on is a critical debate point for every election and this debate over Social Security and Medicare really helps crystallize whose side Biden is on versus whose side Republicans are on in a very effective way for him,\" said Democratic pollster Matt Hogan, who helped conduct an extensive series of bipartisan polls during the 2022 campaign measuring attitudes among seniors for the AARP, the giant lobby for the elderly.  ", "From Franklin Roosevelt through Hubert Humphrey and Tip O'Neill, generations of Democrats have framed themselves as the defenders of the social safety net for seniors against Republicans who they say would unravel it. Biden showed how comfortable he was stepping into those shoes during his 2012 vice-presidential debate with Ryan, then a young representative from Wisconsin who Romney had selected as his running mate.  ", "Nearly 30 years Biden's junior, Ryan was an unflinching advocate of restructuring Social Security and Medicare to reduce costs over time. In particular, Ryan was the principal supporter of a conservative plan to convert Medicare, the giant federal health insurance program for the elderly, into a system called \"premium support.\" Under that proposal, Medicare would be transformed from its current structure, in which the government directly pays doctors and hospitals who provide care for beneficiaries, into a voucher (or \"premium support\") system, in which the government would provide recipients a fixed sum to purchase private insurance. Ryan had also drafted proposals to partially privatize Social Security by allowing workers to divert part of their payroll taxes into private investment accounts, a change that would have reduced the tax dollars flowing into the system and eventually required substantial cuts in guaranteed benefits.  ", "For nearly 11 minutes during the debate in October 2012, moderator Martha Raddatz of ABC skillfully guided Biden and Ryan through a heated, but civil and substantive, discussion of Social Security and Medicare's future. Ryan insisted that changes were needed to preserve the programs' long-term viability and that current seniors and those near retirement would not see their benefits reduced.  ", "Biden appealed openly to the Democrats' historic image as the programs' protectors and condemned Ryan and the GOP for wanting to partially privatize them. At one point in the debate, Biden declared: \"we will be no part of a [Medicare] voucher program or the privatization of Social Security.\" A few moments later, he insisted: \"These guys haven't been big on Medicare from the beginning. And they've always been about Social Security as little as you can do. Look, folks, use your common sense. Who do you trust on this?\"  ", "At the time, Democrats felt Biden had at least held his own, restoring the party's momentum after Obama's surprisingly listless performance eight days earlier in his first debate against Romney. And Democrats through the rest of the campaign railed against the Republican ticket as a threat to Social Security and Medicare.  ", "But on election day, those arguments did not translate into gains for Obama and Biden among seniors or the older working adults (aged 45-64) nearing retirement. As Hogan noted, the newly passed Affordable Care Act, which generated some of its funding through savings in Medicare, was extremely unpopular at the time among older voters. Obama and Biden not only lost seniors and the older working age adults, but actually ran slightly more poorly among both groups in 2012 than they did in 2008.  ", "In fact, no Democratic presidential nominee since Al Gore in 2000 has carried most seniors in a presidential campaign; Obama in 2008 was the only one since Gore to carry most of the older working age adults. Among older Whites, the Democratic deficit is even more pronounced: the Republican presidential nominee has carried around three-fifths of both White seniors and those nearing retirement in each of the past four elections. Biden in 2020 slightly improved on Hillary Clinton's anemic 2016 performance with both groups, but still lost to Trump by 15 percentage points among White seniors and by 23 points among the Whites nearing retirement, according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. Biden performed especially poorly among older Whites without a college degree - an economically stressed group heavily reliant on the federal retirement programs.  ", "Estimates by Catalist, a Democratic targeting firm, and the Pew Research Center likewise found that Trump in both 2016 and 2020 beat his Democratic opponents among both seniors and the older working adults. Like the exit polls, the Catalist data show the Republican nominees carrying about three-fifths of White seniors and older working adults in each of the past three presidential elections.  ", "The story is similar in congressional contests. In House elections, the exit polls found Republicans winning all seniors and older working adults comfortably in the 2014 and 2022 midterm campaigns and narrowly carrying them even in 2018 when Democrats romped overall. In all three of those midterm congressional elections, Republicans carried about three-fifths of the near retirement White adults, while they also reached that elevated threshold among White seniors in both the 2014 and 2022 campaigns.  ", "Republicans have maintained these advantages with older voters despite polls showing that most Americans trust Democrats more than the GOP to protect Social Security and Medicare, and that most Americans, especially seniors, oppose the intermittently surfacing GOP proposals to partially privatize both programs.  ", "Politically, \"Democrats have used Social Security and Medicare really a lot over the past two or three decades, maybe four decades,\" said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. \"The payoff has been a lot less than Democrats have generally thought it would be.\"  ", "Could this time be different for Biden and the Democrats? Congressional Republicans have certainly provided plenty of evidence for his claim that they still hope to restructure the programs. The proposed 2023 budget by the Republican Study Committee, the members of which include about three-fourths of House Republicans, reprises the ideas of converting Medicare into a premium support system and establishing private investment accounts under Social Security, while also raising the retirement age for both programs and reducing Social Security benefits over time. And although Florida Sen. Rick Scott renounced the idea late last week, his \"Rescue America\" agenda did include a proposal to require Congress to reauthorize all federal programs, including Social Security and Medicare, every five years.  ", "These ideas have precipitated an unusual degree of open Republican dissension. Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell repeatedly, and unreservedly, denounced the Scott plan until the Florida senator backed off. Trump recently released a video in which he declared the GOP should not cut \"a single penny\" of Social Security or Medicare benefits - which put him directly at odds with the three-fourths of House Republicans in the Republican Study Committee. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, bending more toward Trump's position, seems unlikely to incorporate into the GOP budget plans the RSC's most sweeping changes in Social Security and Medicare.  ", "Kessler believes Biden may succeed where other Democrats have failed at hurting the GOP with the issue, and he argued that the conspicuous Republican infighting demonstrates they share that concern. \"We are watching a high-profile battle that I've never really seen before on these issues in the Republican Party,\" Kessler said. \"And part of it is clearly they think it's a problem when they didn't years ago. If they think it's a problem, maybe it's a problem.\"  ", "Stuart Stevens, who served as Romney's chief strategist in the 2012 campaign but has since become a fierce critic of the Trump-era GOP, also believes the party could face more risk over its entitlement agenda than it did back then. The reason is that he thinks the idea of sunsetting Social Security and Medicare every five years, even if Scott is trying to jettison it, may prove more immediately tangible and understandable to voters than Ryan's complex ideas of partially privatizing both programs.   ", "\"The question I always ask myself in campaigns is 'are you talking about something the other side doesn't want to talk about?'\" Stevens said. \"That's probably a good sign that they are losing on the issue.\"  ", "Whether Biden proves more effective than other recent Democrats at attracting older voters around Social Security and Medicare will likely pivot on whether seniors believe the GOP genuinely would cut the programs if given the power to do so, argued Robert Blendon, a professor emeritus at the Harvard School of Public Health, who specializes in public attitudes about the social safety net. \"If the senior community actually believes that it's being threatened it really would affect their votes,\" he predicted. But, he added, \"as long as they are not threatened, the other values of seniors on top issues more and more correspond with Republicans.\"  ", "There's no doubt about the second half of that equation. Polling has consistently found that older Whites, in particular, are more receptive than their younger counterparts to hardline Trump-era GOP messages around crime, immigration and the broader currents of racial and cultural change: for instance, about half of Whites older than 50 agree that discrimination against Whites is now as big a problem as bias against minorities, a far higher percentage than among younger Whites, according to a new national survey by the Public Religion Research Institute. Older Whites are also more likely than younger generations to lack a college degree or to identify as Christians, attributes that generally predict sympathy for GOP cultural and racial arguments.  ", "Through the 21st century, those cultural and racial attitudes among older White voters have consistently trumped any concerns they may hold about the Republican commitment to Social Security and Medicare. Despite Biden's impassioned articulation of the case against the GOP, that didn't change even in 2012 when Republicans placed on their national ticket a vice presidential nominee who directly embodied the GOP aspirations to reconfigure and retrench those programs.   ", "Even small changes in seniors' preferences could have a big impact in closely balanced states with a large retiree population like Arizona and Pennsylvania. But the entrenched GOP advantage among older voters over the past two decades suggests Biden's hopes in 2024 may pivot less on improving with the \"gray\" than maximizing his vote among the \"brown\": the diverse, younger generations that recoil from the same Republican messages on culture and race that electrify so many older Whites.

It only sent forces into countries it had taken over in 1945 (Hungary 1956, Czechoslovakia 1968).\"  ", "NATO funding", "Trump said while talking about NATO funding: \"And I told delinquent foreign nations - they were delinquent, they weren't paying their bills - that if they wanted our protection, they had to pay up, and they had to pay up now.\"   ", "Facts First: It's not true that NATO countries weren't paying \"bills\" until Trump came along or that they were \"delinquent\" in the sense of failing to pay bills - as numerous fact-checkers pointed out when Trump repeatedly used such language during his presidency. NATO members haven't been failing to pay their share of the organization's common budget to run the organization. And while it's true that most NATO countries were not (and still are not) meeting NATO's target of each country spending a minimum of 2% of gross domestic product on defense, that 2% figure is what NATO calls a \"guideline\";  it is not some sort of binding contract, and it does not create liabilities. An official NATO recommitment to the 2% guideline in 2014 merely said that members not currently at that level would \"aim to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade.\"", "NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg did credit Trump for securing increases in European NATO members' defense spending, but it's worth noting that those countries' spending had also increased in the last two years of the Obama administration following Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea and the recommitment that year to the 2% guideline. NATO notes on its website that 2022 was \"the eighth consecutive year of rising defence spending across European Allies and Canada.\"  ", "NATO's existence", "Boasting of how he had secured additional funding for NATO from countries, Trump claimed, \"Actually, NATO wouldn't even exist if I didn't get them to pay up.\"    ", "Facts First: This is nonsense. ", "There was never any indication that NATO, created in 1949, would have ceased to exist in the early 2020s without additional funding from some members. The alliance was stable even with many members not meeting the alliance's guideline of having members spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense.   ", "We don't often fact-check claims about what might have happened in an alternative scenario, but this Trump claim has no basis in reality. \"The quote doesn't make sense, obviously,\" said Erwan Lagadec, research professor at George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs and an expert on NATO.    ", "Lagadec noted that NATO has had no trouble getting allies to cover the roughly $3 billion in annual \"direct\" funding for the organization, which is \"peanuts\" to this group of countries. And he said that the only NATO member that had given \"any sign\" in recent years that it was thinking about leaving the alliance \"was ... the US, under Trump.\" Lagadec added that the US leaving the alliance is one scenario that could realistically kill it, but that clearly wasn't what Trump was talking about in his remarks on spending levels.  ", "James Goldgeier, an American University professor of international relations and Brookings Institution visiting fellow, said in an email: \"NATO was founded in 1949, so it seems very clear that Donald Trump had nothing to do with its existence. In fact, the worry was that he would pull the US out of NATO, as his national security adviser warned he would do if he had been reelected.\"  ", "The cost of NATO's headquarters", "Trump mocked NATO's headquarters, saying, \"They spent - an office building that cost $3 billion. It's like a skyscraper in Manhattan laid on its side. It's one of the longest buildings I've ever seen. And I said, 'You should have - instead of spending $3 billion, you should have spent $500 million building the greatest bunker you've ever seen. Because Russia didn't - wouldn't even need an airplane attack. One tank one shot through that beautiful glass building and it's gone.'\"   ", "Facts First: NATO did spend a lot of money on its headquarters in Belgium, but Trump's \"$3 billion\" figure is a major exaggeration. When Trump used the same inaccurate figure in early 2020, NATO told CNN that the headquarters was actually constructed for a sum under the approved budget of about $1.18 billion euro, which is about $1.3 billion at exchange rates as of Sunday morning.", "The Pulitzer Prize", "Trump made his usual argument that The Washington Post and The New York Times should not have won a prestigious journalism award, a 2018 Pulitzer Prize, for their reporting on Russian interference in the 2016 election and its connections to Trump's team. He then said, \"And they were exactly wrong. And now they've even admitted that it was a hoax. It was a total hoax, and they got the prize.\"   ", "Facts First: The Times and Post have not made any sort of \"hoax\" admission. \"The claim is completely false,\" Times spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander said in an email on Sunday.", "Stadtlander continued: \"When our Pulitzer Prize shared with The Washington Post was challenged by the former President, the award was upheld by the Pulitzer Prize Board after an independent review. The board stated that 'no passages or headlines, contentions or assertions in any of the winning submissions were discredited by facts that emerged subsequent to the conferral of the prizes.' The Times's reporting was also substantiated by the Mueller investigation and Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into the matter.\"  ", "The Post referred CNN to that same July statement from the Pulitzer Prize Board.   ", "Awareness of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline", "Trump claimed of his opposition to Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany: \"Nord Stream 2 - Nobody ever heard of it ... right? Nobody ever heard of Nord Stream 2 until I came along. I started talking about Nord Stream 2. I had to go call it 'the pipeline' because nobody knew what I was talking about.\"   ", "Facts First: This is standard Trump hyperbole; it's just not true that \"nobody\" had heard of Nord Stream 2 before he began discussing it. Nord Stream 2 was a regular subject of media, government and diplomatic discussion before Trump took office. In fact, Biden publicly criticized it as vice president in 2016. Trump may well have generated increased US awareness to the controversial project, but \"nobody ever heard of Nord Stream 2 until I came along\" isn't true.", "Trump and Nord Stream 2", "Trump claimed, \"I got along very well with Putin even though I'm the one that ended his pipeline. Remember they said, 'Trump is giving a lot to Russia.' Really? Putin actually said to me, 'If you're my friend, I'd hate like hell to see you as my enemy.' Because I ended the pipeline, right? Do you remember? Nord Stream 2.\" He continued, \"I ended it. It was dead.\"   ", "Facts First: Trump did not kill Nord Stream 2. While he did approve sanctions on companies working on the project, that move came nearly three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already around an estimated 90% complete - and the state-owned Russian gas company behind the project said shortly after the sanctions that it would complete the pipeline itself. The company announced in December 2020 that construction was resuming. And with days left in Trump's term in January 2021, Germany announced that it had renewed permission for construction in its waters.", "The pipeline never began operations; Germany ended up halting the project as Russia was about to invade Ukraine early last year. The pipeline was damaged later in the year in what has been described as an act of sabotage.   ", "The Obama administration and Ukraine", "Trump claimed that while he provided lethal assistance to Ukraine, the Obama administration \"didn't want to get involved\" and merely \"supplied the bedsheets.\" He said, \"Do you remember? They supplied the bedsheets. And maybe even some pillows from [pillow businessman] Mike [Lindell], who's sitting right over here. ... But they supplied the bedsheets.\"   ", "Facts First: This is inaccurate. While it's true that the Obama administration declined to provide weapons to Ukraine, it provided more than $600 million in security assistance to Ukraine between 2014 and 2016 that involved far more than bedsheets. The aid included counter-artillery and counter-mortar radars, armored Humvees, tactical drones, night vision devices and medical supplies.", "Biden and a Ukrainian prosecutor", "Trump claimed that Biden, as vice president, held back a billion dollars from Ukraine until the country fired a prosecutor who was \"after Hunter\" and a company that was paying him. Trump was referring to Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, who sat on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings.   ", "Facts First: This is baseless. There has never been any evidence that Hunter Biden was under investigation by the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who had been widely faulted by Ukrainian anti-corruption activists and European countries for failing to investigate corruption. A former Ukrainian deputy prosecutor and a top anti-corruption activist have both said the Burisma-related investigation was dormant at the time Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin.", "Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Action Center, told The Washington Post in 2019: \"Shokin was not investigating. He didn't want to investigate Burisma. And Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.\" In addition, Shokin's successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg in 2019: \"Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws - at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing.\"  ", "Biden, as vice president, was carrying out the policy of the US and its allies, not pursuing his own agenda, in threatening to withhold a billion-dollar US loan guarantee if the Ukrainian government did not sack Shokin. CNN fact-checked Trump's claims on this subject at length in 2019.   ", "Trump and job creation", "Promising to save Americans' jobs if he is elected again, Trump claimed, \"We had the greatest job history of any president ever.\"   ", "Facts First: This is false. The US lost about 2.7 million jobs during Trump's presidency, the worst overall jobs record for any president. The net loss was largely because of the Covid-19 pandemic, but even Trump's pre-pandemic jobs record - about 6.7 million jobs added - was far from the greatest of any president ever. The economy added more than 11.5 million jobs in the first term of Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.", "Tariffs on China", "Trump repeated a trade claim he made frequently during his presidency. Speaking of China, he said he \"charged them\" with tariffs that had the effect of \"bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars pouring into our Treasury from China. Thank you very much, China.\" He claimed that he did this even though \"no other president had gotten even 10 cents - not one president got anything from them.\"   ", "Facts First: As we have written repeatedly, it's not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an \"average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.\" Also, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments - and study after study during Trump's presidency found that Americans were bearing most of the cost of the tariffs.", "The trade deficit with China", "Trump went on to repeat a false claim he made more than 100 times as president - that the US used to have a trade deficit with China of more than $500 billion. He claimed it was \"five-, six-, seven-hundred billion dollars a year.\"  ", "Facts First: The US has never had a $500 billion, $600 billion or $700 billion trade deficit with China even if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade in which the US runs a surplus with China. The pre-Trump record for a goods deficit with China was about $367 billion in 2015. The goods deficit hit a new record of about $418 billion under Trump in 2018 before falling back under $400 billion in subsequent years.", "Trump and the 2020 election ", "Trump said people claim they want to run against him even though, he claimed, he won the 2020 election. He said, \"I won the second election, OK, won it by a lot. You know, when they say, when they say Biden won, the smart people know that didn't [happen].\"   ", "Facts First: This is Trump's regular lie. He lost the 2020 election to Biden fair and square, 306 to 232 in the Electoral College. Biden earned more than 7 million more votes than Trump did. ", "Democrats and elections", "Trump said Democrats are only good at \"disinformation\" and \"cheating on elections.\"   ", "Facts First: This is nonsense. There is just no basis for a broad claim that Democrats are election cheaters. Election fraud and voter fraud are exceedingly rare in US elections, though such crimes are occasionally committed by officials and supporters of both parties. (We'll ignore Trump's subjective claim about \"disinformation.\")", "The liberation of the ISIS caliphate ", "Trump repeated his familiar story about how he had supposedly liberated the \"caliphate\" of terror group ISIS in \"three weeks.\" This time, he said, \"In fact, with the ISIS caliphate, a certain general said it could only be done in three years, 'and probably it can't be done at all, sir.' And I did it in three weeks. I went over to Iraq, met a great general. 'Sir, I can do it in three weeks.' You've heard that story. 'I can do it in three weeks, sir.' 'How are you going to do that?' They explained it. I did it in three weeks. I was told it couldn't be done at all, that it would take at least three years. Did it in three weeks. Knocked out 100% of the ISIS caliphate.\"   ", "Facts First: Trump's claim of eliminating the ISIS caliphate in \"three weeks\" isn't true; the ISIS \"caliphate\" was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump's presidency, in 2019. Even if Trump was starting the clock at the time of his visit to Iraq, in late December 2018, the liberation was proclaimed more than two and a half months later. In addition, Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past, when he said \"I did it\": Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting, and there was major progress against the caliphate under President Barack Obama in 2015 and 2016.", "IHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump's 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. \"The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group's governance project,\" an analyst there said in a statement at the time.  ", "Military equipment left in Afghanistan ", "Trump claimed, as he has before, that the US left behind $85 billion worth of military equipment when it withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021. He said of the leader of the Taliban: \"Now he's got $85 billion worth of our equipment that I bought - $85 billion.\" He added later: \"The thing that nobody ever talks about, we lost 13 [soldiers], we lost $85 billion worth of the greatest military equipment in the world.\"   ", "Facts First: Trump's $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion - a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.", "As other fact-checkers have previously explained, the \"$85 billion\" is a rounded-up figure (it's closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A minority of this funding was for equipment.  ", "The Afghanistan withdrawal and the F-16 ", "Trump claimed that the Taliban acquired F-16 fighter planes because of the US withdrawal, saying: \"They feared the F-16s. And now they own them. Think of it.\"   ", "Facts First: This is false. F-16s were not among the equipment abandoned upon the US withdrawal and the collapse of the Afghan armed forces, since the Afghan armed forces did not fly F-16s.  ", "The border wall ", "Trump claimed that he had kept his promise to complete a wall on the border with Mexico: \"As you know, I built hundreds of miles of wall and completed that task as promised. And then I began to add even more in areas that seemed to be allowing a lot of people to come in.\"   ", "Facts First: It's not true that Trump \"completed\" the border wall. According to an official \"Border Wall Status\" report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump - but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not been completed. ", "The report, provided to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280 miles left to go, about 74 miles were \"in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,\" and that 206 miles were \"currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.\"  ", "Latin America and deportations ", "Trump told his familiar story about how, until he was president, the US was unable to deport MS-13 gang members to other countries, \"especially\" Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras because those countries \"didn't want them.\"   ", "Facts First: It's not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn't take back migrants being deported from the US during Obama's administration, though there were some individual exceptions.", "In 2016, just prior to Trump's presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered \"recalcitrant,\" or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.

The policy did not say the US wouldn't deport \"anyone who comes.\" It explicitly did not apply to anyone who arrived in the country after the end of October 2020, meaning people who arrived under the Biden administration or in the last months of the Trump administration could still be deported.

But Jordan claimed that this was the policy Biden actually implemented on his first day in office; Biden's actual first-day policy was considerably narrower.

They kept it quiet early on, didn't let it out. The job of the next president is going to be getting rid of the insiders that are undermining this government, and you've gotta clean house.\"   ", "Facts First: Norman's narrative is false. The FBI did not tip off the media to its search of Mar-a-Lago; CNN reported the next day that the search \"happened so quietly, so secretly, that it wasn't caught on camera at all.\" Rather, media outlets belatedly sent cameras to Mar-a-Lago because Peter Schorsch, publisher of the website Florida Politics, learned of the search from non-FBI sources and tweeted about it either after it was over or as it was just concluding, and because Trump himself made a public statement less than 20 minutes later confirming that a search had occurred. Schorsch told CNN on Thursday: \"I can, unequivocally, state that the FBI was not one of my two sources which alerted me to the raid.\"", "Brian Stelter, then CNN's chief media correspondent, wrote in his article the day after the search: \"By the time local TV news cameras showed up outside the club, there was almost nothing to see.

News outlets had set up a media \"pool\" to make sure any search there was recorded.  ", "Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a former college and high school football coach, said, \"Going into thousands of kids' homes and talking to parents every year recruiting, half the kids in this country - I'm not talking about race, I'm just talking about - half the kids in this country have one or no parent. And it's because of the attack on faith. People are losing faith because, for some reason, because the attack [on] God.\"   ", "Facts First: Tuberville's claim that half of American children don't have two parents is incorrect. Official figures from the Census Bureau show that, in 2021, about 70% of US children under the age of 18 lived with two parents and about 65% lived with two married parents.", "About 22% of children lived with only a mother, about 5% with only a father, and about 3% with no parent.

While many Americans do struggle with reading, there is no basis for the claim that \"half\" of high school graduates can't read a basic document like a diploma. \"Mr. Tuberville does not know what he's talking about at all,\" said Patricia Edwards, a Michigan State University professor of language and literacy who is a past president of the International Literacy Association and the Literacy Research Association. Edwards said there is \"no evidence\" to support Tuberville's claim. She also said that people who can't read at all are highly unlikely to finish high school and that \"sometimes politicians embellish information.\"", "Tuberville could have accurately said that a significant number of American teenagers and adults have reading trouble, though there is no apparent basis for connecting these struggles with supposed \"woke\" indoctrination. The organization ProLiteracy pointed CNN to 2017 data that found 23% of Americans age 16 to 65 have \"low\" literacy skills in English. That's not \"half,\" as ProLiteracy pointed out, and it includes people who didn't graduate from high school and people who are able to read basic text but struggle with more complex literacy tasks.

Biden did not laugh at the mother who lost her sons to fentanyl, the anti-abortion activist Rebecca Kiessling; in a somber tone, he called her \"a poor mother who lost two kids to fentanyl.\" Rather, he proceeded to laugh about how Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene had baselessly blamed the Biden administration for the young men's deaths even though the tragedy happened in mid-2020, during the Trump administration. You can watch the video of Biden's remarks here. ", "Kiessling has demanded an apology from Biden. She is entitled to her criticism of Biden's remarks and his chuckle - but the video clearly shows Norman was wrong when he claimed Biden was \"laughing at the mother.\"  ", "Rep. Kat Cammack told a story about the first hearing of the new Republican-led House select subcommittee on the supposed \"weaponization\" of the federal government. Cammack claimed she had asked a Democratic witness at this February hearing about his \"incredibly vitriolic\" Twitter feed in which, she claimed, he not only repeatedly criticized Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh but even went \"so far as to encourage people to harass this Supreme Court justice.\"   ", "Facts First: This story is false. The witness Cammack questioned in this February exchange at the subcommittee, former Obama administration deputy assistant attorney general Elliot Williams, did not encourage people to harass Kavanaugh. In fact, it's not even true that Cammack accused him at the February hearing of having encouraged people to harass Kavanaugh. Rather, at the hearing, she merely claimed that Williams had tweeted numerous critical tweets about Kavanaugh but had been \"unusually quiet\" on Twitter after an alleged assassination attempt against the justice. Clearly, not tweeting about the incident is not the same thing as encouraging harassment. ", "Williams, now a CNN legal analyst (he appeared at the subcommittee hearing in his personal capacity), said in a Thursday email that he had \"no idea\" what Cammack was looking at on his innocuous Twitter feed. He said: \"I used to prosecute violent crimes, and clerked for two federal judges. Any suggestion that I've ever encouraged harassment of anyone - and particularly any official of the United States - is insulting and not based in reality.\"  ", "Cammack's spokesperson responded helpfully on Thursday to CNN's initial queries about the story Cammack told at CPAC, explaining that she was referring to her February exchange with Williams. But the spokesperson stopped responding after CNN asked if Cammack was accurately describing this exchange with Williams and if they had any evidence of Williams actually having encouraged the harassment of Kavanaugh.   ", "Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana boasted about the state of the country \"when Republicans were in charge.\" Among other claims about Trump's tenure, he said that \"in four years,\" Republicans \"delivered 3.5% unemployment\" and \"created 8 million new jobs.\"   ", "Facts First: This is inaccurate in two ways. First, the economic numbers for the full \"four years\" of Trump's tenure are much worse than these numbers Kennedy cited; Kennedy was actually referring to Trump's first three years while ignoring the fourth, which was marred by the Covid-19 pandemic. Second, there weren't \"8 million new jobs\" created even in Trump's first three years.", "Kennedy could have correctly said there was a 3.5% unemployment rate after three years of the Trump administration, but not after four. The unemployment rate skyrocketed early in Trump's fourth year, on account of the pandemic, before coming down again, and it was 6.3% when Trump left office in early 2021. (It fell to 3.4% this January under Biden, better than in any month under Trump.)  ", "And while the economy added about 6.7 million jobs under Trump before the pandemic-related crash of March and April 2020, that's not the \"8 million jobs\" Kennedy claimed - and the economy ended up shedding millions of jobs in Trump's fourth year. Over the full four years of Trump's tenure, the economy netted a loss of about 2.7 million jobs.  ", "Lara Trump, Donald Trump's daughter-in-law and an adviser to his 2020 campaign, claimed that the last time a CPAC crowd was gathered at this venue in Maryland, in February 2020, \"We had the lowest unemployment in American history.\" After making other boasts about Donald Trump's presidency, she said, \"But how quickly it all changed.\" She added, \"Under Joe Biden, America is crumbling.\"   ", "Facts First: Lara Trump's claim about February 2020 having \"the lowest unemployment in American history\" is false. The unemployment rate was 3.5% at the time - tied for the lowest since 1969, but not the all-time lowest on record, which was 2.5% in 1953. And while Lara Trump didn't make an explicit claim about unemployment under Biden, it's not true that things are worse today on this measure; again, the most recent unemployment rate, 3.4% for January 2023, is better than the rate at the time of CPAC's 2020 conference or at any other time during Donald Trump's presidency. ", "Multiple speakers at CPAC decried the high number of fentanyl overdose deaths. But some of the speakers inflated that number while attacking Biden's immigration policy.   ", "Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump administration official, claimed that \"in the last 12 months in America, deaths by fentanyl poisoning totaled 110,000 Americans.\" He blamed \"Biden's open border\" for these deaths.   ", "Rep. Scott Perry claimed: \"Meanwhile over on this side of the border, where there isn't anybody, they're running this fentanyl in; it's killing 100,000 Americans - over 100,000 Americans - a year.\"   ", "Facts First: It's not true that there are more than 100,000 fentanyl deaths per year. That is the total number of deaths from all drug overdoses in the US; there were 106,699 such deaths in 2021. But the number of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone, primarily fentanyl, is smaller - 70,601 in 2021. ", "Fentanyl-related overdoses are clearly a major problem for the country and by far the biggest single contributor to the broader overdose problem. Nonetheless, claims of \"110,000\" and \"over 100,000\" fentanyl deaths per year are significant exaggerations. And while the number of overdose deaths and fentanyl-related deaths increased under Biden in 2021, it was also troubling under Trump in 2020 - 91,799 total overdose deaths and 56,516 for synthetic opioids other than methadone.   ", "It's also worth noting that fentanyl is largely smuggled in by US citizens through legal ports of entry rather than by migrants sneaking past other parts of the border. Contrary to frequent Republican claims, the border is not \"open\"; border officers have seized thousands of pounds of fentanyl under Biden.

You know, and so, maybe that's a part of it.\"    ", "\"But the big part I would suggest to you, based upon what it's saying here, is the removal of constraint,\" he continued. \"So our society provided the constraint. And so, which is the responsibility of a society to constrain people from doing evil? Well, you remove the constraints, and then evil occurs.\"   ", "Testosterone levels in men have dropped in recent decades, and researchers are unsure why, but the drop is not 50%, and there is no indication that a drop in testosterone affects sexual orientation. Likewise, there is no evidence that estrogen in the water supply, for which birth control pills account for a statistically insignificant amount, affects sexual orientation. The claim that chemicals in tap water could turn people gay has gained ground with conspiracy theorists over the years, most memorably with fringe commentator Alex Jones, who said chemicals in the water were \"turning the friggin' frogs gay.\"   ", "In the same discussion, Peri called homosexuality \"shameful,\" linking it to disease.

", "\"Homosexuality was praised,\" Peri said. \"LGBTQ today is being emphasized everywhere, even on children's shows. And so ultimately the Romans had become weak.\"   ", "Peri's discussions, which focused on seeing the modern world through a Biblical viewpoint, often touched on social topics. In other discussions uploaded on YouTube, Peri said that \"not very long ago being a mother was the pinnacle of being a woman,\" and he compared abortion to genocides like the Holocaust.

Six million Jews,\" said Peri, pointing to a chart comparing abortion to genocide.    ", "Peri and DeSantis did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.   ", "Peri's appointment to the oversight board comes after a long-standing battle between DeSantis and Disney over the Parental Rights in Education Act - which critics have called Florida's \"Don't Say Gay\" law. The law bars schools from teaching about sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third-grade classrooms and in older classrooms that do not meet yet-to-be-defined standards.   ", "After Disney's then-chairman spoke out against the bill last year, DeSantis stripped the company of its unique governing power within the Reedy Creek Improvement District, the special taxing district created more than half a century ago that effectively gave the entertainment giant control of what has grown to 25,000 acres around its Orlando-area theme parks.   ", "On Monday, DeSantis changed course and signed a new bill that extended the life of the Reedy Creek Improvement District but gave the governor new powers over its future. The new law ousted the existing board, renamed it the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District and allowed DeSantis to appoint all five members - one of whom was Peri.   ", "This week, DeSantis told supporters that Disney's opposition to the Parental Rights in Education Act was a \"only a mild annoyance\" and that the motivation for effectively punishing the company was in response to it allegedly injecting \"a lot of this sexuality into the programming for young kids.\" He has suggested that the new board could influence Disney's business decisions by adding park discounts for Florida residents and even altering the company's entertainment offerings.   ", "\"When you lose your way, you know, you gotta have people that are going to tell you the truth, and so we hope that they can get back on,\" DeSantis said. \"But I think all these board members very much would like to see the type of entertainment that all families can appreciate.\"   ", "Historically, the Reedy Creek board oversaw a fire department, water systems, roadways and building inspections around the Disney theme parks and could issue bonds and take on debt for long-term infrastructure programs. Democratic lawmakers in Florida who opposed DeSantis' takeover of the board warned that a politically motivated body could wield that power over Disney.

Would the board then be able to push a company into changing their business model just so that they don't misalign (with) them?\"   ", "In addition to Peri, DeSantis also appointed to the board Martin Garcia, a Tampa lawyer whose private investment firm contributed $50,000 to the governor's 2022 reelection campaign, and Bridget Ziegler, a co-founder of the conservative organization Moms for Liberty and the wife of Christian Ziegler, the new chairman of the Republican Party of Florida.

Those with higher incomes would be excluded.  ", "If a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness.

In contrast to the one-time student loan cancellation program, the new repayment plan could help both current and future borrowers.", "Additionally, in July, changes will be made to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which allows certain government and nonprofit employees to seek federal student loan forgiveness after making 10 years of qualifying payments. The changes will make it easier for some borrowers to receive debt forgiveness.

His moves to punish Disney for speaking out against a Florida measure to restrict certain lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in schools has especially attracted criticism from the right.

", "Newsom often posts criticism of DeSantis on social media and this past July 4, he took to the Sunshine State's airwaves, paying $105,000 to run an ad on Fox News in Florida that declared, \"Freedom is under attack in your state.\"   ", "\"Literally, how many other governors does anyone even care about? I mean, when you go to California, they got all these problems there. Their governor's preoccupied with me and what we're doing in Florida. ... It's incredible,\" DeSantis said Thursday. \"And honestly, I just know that game. If they're not shooting that means you're not getting anything done. That they're coming after me because I'm standing up for the people that I represent. I view that as positive reinforcement.\"  ", "DeSantis also spoke at length about his recent legislation giving him more control over Disney's special tax district, and described the entertainment giant's management as caving in to \"woke ideology.\"  ", "\"I believe woke ideology is pernicious. I believe what's at stake is not just 'My policies are good,'\" he said. \"We should not all be suffering under the cloak of wokeness. ... This issue with Disney is a good example of that. ... They were basically a law unto themselves, and they got away with it for a long time because they were so powerful. They were the 800-pound gorilla, but they made the mistake of trying to stick their nose into sensitive matters involving children, involving education, and involving family.\"  ", "DeSantis also went into detail about stacking Florida's school boards with conservatives and his plan to fight \"critical race theory\" in schools.
