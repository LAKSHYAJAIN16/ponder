Peak & Sons drugstore on the courthouse square. Within minutes, the flames, fanned by a southwesterly wind, spread to adjacent buildings. Over the next three hours, the entire square burned. Only the brick courthouse at the center survived, although, portentously, the interior was incinerated by heat. Only a husk remained. There were no deaths.\u00a0", "In weeks prior, mysterious fires had destroyed barns, cabins, and outbuildings in Dallas County. Secession and civil war loomed. John Brown's raid on the federal armory at Harper's Ferry the previous fall and the fiery rhetoric of Northern abolitionists stoked fears of a slave rebellion among the highly literate local population. In the Sulfur River breaks to the northeast, tensions brewed between Unionist and pro-secession smallholders and would soon turn murderous. North Texas newspapers urged vigilance against seditionists determined to lead slaves in insurrection.", "Before the remains of the town had cooled, Charles Pryor, a slaveholder and editor of the Dallas Herald, wrote that abolitionists had fomented a \"deep-laid scheme of villainy\" to terrorize North Texas. After interrogating dozens of slaves, Dallas's vigilance committee charged three alleged ringleaders. On July 23, after a closed-door meeting, city leaders sentenced the accused men to death and every other adult slave in the county to disciplinary beating. The next afternoon, the three were hanged on the bank of the Trinity River.\u00a0", "Dallas Herald", "Beyond the violence of the lynching, the most unsettling aspect of the account is that the men who ordered the murder were not psychopaths.

These educated men, whatever their positions on slavery, could look at the evidence: A town square built of wood; a 109-degree day; fires used for blacksmithing, cooking, and steam generation; prevalence of cigar smoking among men; the highly unstable phosphorus matches in common use; confessions extracted by torture. Indeed, two prominent jurists respected for their fairness and generosity threw up their hands after their objections were ignored.\u00a0", "The fire and the accused symbolized the fears and resentments of people barely removed from the western frontier and on the verge of war, who knew of and resented what had been said and written about their culture in the free states. The innocence or guilt of the accused mattered little to them. Something had to be done. A message had to be sent, both as a warning and as vindication. \"You see? These men have confessed. This is why these people cannot be let loose among us. You outsiders cannot understand and have no business passing judgement. We will handle matters in our own way.\"\u00a0", "In their climate of thought, white Texans in 1860 could not imagine that their actions would embarrass and disgust their descendants. They could not conceive of millions of immigrants arriving over the next sixty years-of influential people another century on who would publicly lament that descendants of Antebellum Southerners take any pride whatsoever in their heritage.\u00a0", "The most formidable minds in the South produced sophisticated arguments for slavery while Northern abolitionists, in simple, fundamentalist language, invoked transcendent authority in calling for bloody death and fiery destruction. In The Legacy of the Civil War, Robert Penn Warren wrote, \"[Before] 1861, the only function then left open to intellect in the South was apologetics for the closed society, not criticism of it ... The philosophy of the Southern apologist did, however, offer space in its finely wrought interstices for the bravado, arrogance, paranoid suspiciousness, and the reckless or ignorant disregard for consequences that marked the Southern 'fire-eater.'\"", "The Legacy of the Civil War", "My research for a novel I wrote around the above-mentioned events in Dallas led me to Without Sanctuary, a book of horrific photographs of victims of Southern lynch mobs from the 1890s through the 1930s. I had misgivings about looking through the images, but I felt a duty to absorb as far as possible the horror I planned to write about. I thought I knew what I was getting into-I had seen old lynching photos here and there-but there is no preparing for the images and descriptions of burnings, hangings, dismemberment, castration, mutilation, torture, page after page, from light poles, tree limbs, bridges, some with crowds looking on. All but a few of the victims were black. Anyone but a sociopath will struggle with these images long after even one viewing.\u00a0", "Without Sanctuary", "Without Sanctuary opens with a short foreword by civil rights hero and Georgia congressman John Lewis, who recalls that as a boy growing up in rural Alabama, he could hardly believe his elders' stories of nightriders and racial terror. \"What is it in the human psyche that would drive a person to commit such violence against their fellow citizens?\" He closes with a call to prevent \"anything like this from ever happening again.\"", "Without Sanctuary", "Historian Leon Litwack follows with \"Hell Hounds,\" an essay that places the photographs in context. He mentions accounts of spectators fighting over \"souvenirs\"-fingers, ears, pieces of internal organs. Newspapers of the day either defended the lynch mobs outright or justified the lawlessness as necessary for public safety. Professor Litwack writes that in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, two or three black Southerners were hanged, burned at the stake or quietly murdered every week. \"Between 1882 and 1968, an estimated 4,742 blacks met their deaths at the hands of lynch mobs. As many if not more blacks were victims of legal lynchings (speedy trials and executions), private white violence...murdered by a variety of means in isolated rural sections...\" The latter claim is no less plausible for being unprovable.\u00a0", "Litwack further notes that lynching had long served as a means of extralegal justice in the Far West and Midwest, and that most of those victims had been white, but that from 1890 onward the practice became almost exclusive to the South, with black Americans as victims. (Tuskegee University estimates that between 1882 and 1968, 3,446 black and 1,297 white people were lynched in the United States.) There were dissenters. Litwack quotes the mayor of Statesboro, Georgia: \"If our grand juries won't indict these lynchers, if our petit juries won't convict, and if our soldiers won't shoot, what are we coming to?\" Litwack further notes, \"Townspeople closed ranks to protect their own kind...eyewitnesses refused to testify...\"", "Hilton Als, a staff writer for the New Yorker, follows Litwack's essay with several pages of stylish narcissism in which he refers to the \"flashbulb smiles\" of white lynchers. I see not flashbulb smiles but self-conscious defiance of people who, like the Dallas mob decades before, cannot imagine a radically different order under which their great-grandchildren might view these photographs with revulsion and incomprehension. Robert Penn Warren also described this toxic insularity in The Legacy of the Civil War: \"In defeat, the Solid South was born - not only the witless automation of fidelity to the Democratic Party, but the mystique of prideful difference, identity, and defensiveness ... in the moment of death, the Confederacy entered upon its immortality.\"\u00a0", "New Yorker", "The Legacy of the Civil War", "The likelihood that some of the victims were guilty of serious crimes detracts nothing from the photographs. The lynched were denied their rights as citizens. Law enforcement and criminal justice in the long-settled South faced none of the exigencies common to frontier people dealing with dangerous criminals. Yet the violent order persisted, in part, because most people who opposed it simply looked the other way rather than face entrenched local power backed by vindictive rabble.\u00a0", "Initially, the meaning of the title Without Sanctuary seemed obvious: In the Jim Crow South, the rule of law provided black Americans no sanctuary against racial terror. As I forced myself through the book, a second, subtler meaning came to me: The photographs stand as an indictment against which white Americans, especially those with roots in the South, can find no sanctuary. This history must be faced out in the open, not in perpetual guilt, which devolves into blood libel, but in honesty and with full understanding of lingering effects and the murderous irrationality into which ordinary people can descend when freed from consequences.\u00a0", "Without Sanctuary", "In The True and Only Heaven: Progress and its Critics, historian Christopher Lasch attributes much of the civil rights movement's success in the South in the early 1960s to the ability of Martin Luther King Jr. and his followers to \"[expose] the moral claims of the white supremacist regime in the South to the most damaging scrutiny...\" King accomplished this, according to Lasch, by addressing white oppressors \"not only as fellow sinners but also as fellow Southerners...\" and by reminding his followers not to allow their suffering to serve as an excuse for dysfunction. Furthermore, per Lasch, the black leadership was respectably middle class, a reality not lost on moderate white clergy who became \"tortured souls\" when faced with the demand that they live up to their professed ideas.", "The True and Only Heaven: Progress and its Critics", "Nor could white Southerners escape the judgement of a nation appalled by images of fire hoses and dogs turned on protestors or images of black school children escorted through baying mobs of whites who could not imagine that a decade on no American student would get through middle school without an opportunity to consider those faces contorted by anger and hate. They were aggrieved and sure in their justification by what Warren called \"The Great Alibi.\" Again, from The Legacy of the Civil War:\u00a0", "The Legacy of the Civil War", "By the Great Alibi, pellagra, hookworm, and illiteracy are all explained away... Laziness becomes the aesthetic sense, blood-lust rising from a matrix of boredom and resentful misery becomes a sense of honor and ignorance becomes divine revelation.", "The race problem, according to the Great Alibi, is the doom defined by history-by New England slavers, New England and Middlewestern Abolitionists, cotton, climate, the Civil War, Reconstruction, Wall Street, the Jews.", "For more than half a century after the end of Reconstruction, Southern apologists guarded and curated their region's history with remarkable success rather than directly confront the malignancy of racial violence. Eventually, denial became impossible in light of evidence. Legislation backed by threat of force ended the most egregious forms. But true changes in the hearts of Southerners began with \"tortured souls,\" stigma, and relentless, merciless cultural pressure from which there was no sanctuary.\u00a0", "In August 2022, The Caucus of African American Leaders, based in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, announced the creation of the Emmett Till Alert System.

That amounts to ancestor worship. ", "Nevertheless, it is true that when I became Catholic, I felt in some stronger sense connected to the long heritage of the Church, going back to the apostolic era -- this, in a way I did not and likely would not have been able to as an engaged Protestant. I think this means something. It is true that culture alone will not save you, but this immersion in all the eras of the Church's past, especially of the first millennium, helped me to understand better what it meant to be saved (i.e., it was not just a matter of what happened to you after death). It gave me a stronger sense of formation. It is undeniably true, at least in my case, that I had a much stronger sense of the connection between the historical form of the Christian faith, within the West, and the structures of Western civilization.

I loved most things about being Catholic, but the torment over the scandal corroded my ability to believe in the authority of the Catholic Church. I could not then and could not now affirm Pastor Aeternus, or that my eternal salvation depended on being in communion with the See of Peter. I can tell you that Adam van Buskirk is correct that to become Orthodox is, in some felt sense, to step away from the West. Obviously we still live in the West, even if we're Orthodox, and this is why I want Catholic and Protestant churches, who account for almost all of the Christian churches in the West, to be strong. I'd rather everybody convert to Orthodoxy, for sure! But given how unlikely that is, it serves the common good for all Christian churches to be strong.

But I am deeply Western, and that's not going to change. That's one of the most interesting things you get when traveling abroad: that no matter how much you, as an American, love the country you're visiting and its people, you will have more in common with the fellow American you bump into at the foreign bar than you will with any local in the same place, no matter how different you and the American may be.

That is no reason not to do it, if you come to believe that you can worship Christ in greater truth within another tradition. I became Orthodox after Joseph Ratzinger was elected Pope, and wept -- literally -- to leave him behind, because I loved him so much. Nevertheless, I was convinced by that time that my faith in Christ was on the line -- and therefore my salvation -- because I was far, far too broken to keep faith with Jesus within Catholicism. ", "I really and truly love being Orthodox. It has made a better Christian of me. But I am a man of the West, by birth and by formation, and always will be. I don't apologize for it, or feel like less of an Orthodox Christian because of it. And the thing is -- I really noticed this when in rural Ireland -- we were all one church until 1054. The Christians of the Greek East worshiped in different ways than the ones of the Latin West, but we still had ecclesial unity. When I went to pray in the cave of St. Colman, the 7th century Irish hermit, I was in the lair of a saint who was both Catholic and Orthodox. I love to think of the Church that way. Strangely, because the ordinary life in the Orthodox imaginary is so rooted in the patristic era, I learned way, way more about the Fathers of the Church, and the saints of the early Church -- holy men and women who are considered saints by the Roman Catholics too -- than I ever did as a Catholic. Those saints are often Eastern, but they are part of the West's heritage as well. I find that when I became Orthodox, I didn't really \"lose\" Western saints (though it's certainly true that the farther the Catholic Church gets from 1054, the less natural affinity an Orthodox Christian of the West has for its canonized saints), as much as I gained a greater appreciation for the breadth of the Church's catholicity.", "You can find Orthodox Christians who want to throw down with the West over the papacy, and any number of things. I'm not one of them. I'm grateful for what I gained of Christ as a Protestant and as a Catholic, and I'm grateful for what the Holy Spirit has done for me within Orthodoxy. Often I'll talk with Orthodox converts from the West, and we will observe how impossible it would be to go back from whence we came after experiencing the richness of the spiritual treasures in Orthodoxy. That said, when I pray in Gothic cathedrals in France, for example, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God is there, and I give thanks for that fact.", "So, look, when Adam van Buskirk says that \"if you leave, they win by default\" -- meaning those Catholics who are busy radically reforming their Church -- I have to ask, \"What do you lose by staying in a Church that no longer believes in itself?\" That was the question that eventually pushed me out -- and I am sure that a lot of faithful Catholics are feeling very anxious now that Pope Francis is showing how shaky things really can be when a Pope makes use of his unparalleled authority (the Orthodox have no figure like him) to change the Church. Amid my own crisis, I realized, at last, that I was only staying Catholic because I was afraid not to be. Mass was little more than an occasion of anxiety and anger, over the scandal -- and the sure knowledge that if there was anything else there to hold on to, I probably could have borne the suffering. But there wasn't, except the Eucharist ... which the Orthodox have too (according to Catholic teaching), as well as an incomparably rich liturgy and devotional life that has drawn me to Christ in ways I couldn't have imagined when I first entered the Orthodox Church.

I would have held on to my Catholicism, but the heart of the faith would have been hollowed out within me by my anger and fear. This is not an argument for you, reader, becoming Orthodox; it's just my answer to Van Buskirk's \"if you leave, they win by default\". If I had stayed, I would have lost Jesus, in any real sense, because of my own brokenness, and the brokenness within Catholicism. So what in the world would it mean to \"win\"?

For three years as Catholics, my wife and I worshiped at a Maronite Catholic parish in Brooklyn. Were the Lebanese Catholics, who were 100 percent in unity with the Pope, somehow Westerners? I guess, in a way, as they were Catholic. But their culture was very strongly Eastern. Superficially, it felt \"Eastern\" once we started attending there, but after we got used to the Arabic melodies, and the use of some Aramaic in certain liturgical prayers, we realized that this is what it meant to be Catholic, both big-C and little-c (meaning \"universal\").

Now, the institutional left is so firmly entrenched in American schools that they believe they cannot be dislodged or expelled. For those who paid minimal attention to our schools before 2020, this hostile takeover seemed to come out of nowhere. But it didn't.

Again and again and again, \"thinking critically\" is held up as the learning outcome at which all instruction aims. The student who can think critically, we are assured, is the educated student.

Thought happens. So, the \"critical\" in \"critical thinking\" must not mean \"essential.\"", "critical", "avoid", "In truth, when educators talk about \"critical\" thinking, they are implicitly referring to a particular mental attitude-one defined by a radical hostility and skepticism towards ideas and values that are viewed as \"common sense\" or \"inherited wisdom.\" This view of critical thinking owes its heritage to two opposing intellectual traditions. The first is the tradition of Enlightenment empiricism and reason, which holds that the strongest forms of inquiry are those that begin from a position of disbelief and the assumption that nothing can be held as true until it can be logically proven as such.", "disbelief", "proven ", "The second tradition is that of so-called \"critical theory\"-a left-intellectual form of philosophical skepticism that took hold in Europe after World War II, and then immigrated to America. Critical theory often attacks the very pursuit of truth that Enlightenment rationality celebrated; its adherents insist that truth itself is a \"socially constructed\" concept that is utilized to justify unjust forms of cultural and political power. The task for critical theorists, then, is to expose the myth of truth in an effort to weaken public confidence in institutional power-a process they hope might ultimately topple the existing order, so that a new society can be built that affirms a dogmatic view of \"social justice.\"", "itself", "The intermingling of these two schools of thought in American education-one that demands a radical skepticism in pursuit of truth, one that insists that objective truth doesn't exist-helps explain the nihilism and solipsism that flourishes in our schools. When administrators and teachers say that they want to teach students to think critically, they don't mean they want to \"teach them to be good thinkers.\" On the contrary, they mean that they intend to teach them a radical skepticism toward tradition and common values, as if they were inherently irrational.", "Of course, the sphere where this skepticism should be applied is very narrowly defined, and students are tasked with learning its scope. They should be extremely skeptical about Russia's actions, which constitute an assault on Ukraine's sovereignty, for example, but they should never ask whether illegal immigration from Central America represents a violation of U.S. sovereignty. Students should be skeptical about whether race is a legitimate concept, but they shouldn't be skeptical about whether race-based entitlements should be written into public policy. In other words, the truth of traditional values and ideas is subjected to withering doubt and open disdain, while left-liberal ones are assumed to be objectively true and are placed neatly beyond the scope of any serious intellectual consideration.", "extremely", "assumed", "Thus, \"critical thinking\" offers precisely the opposite of what it advertises. Rather than teaching students to be strong thinkers who are prepared to interrogate any and all premises, \"critical thinking\" demands that students adopt a position of unwavering faith in the truth claims of those in positions of institutional authority, which finally results in a reflexive disdain for any real thought at all. \"Critical thinking\" really seeks to create thinkers who can readily deduce what opinions and ideas they are expected to hold in favor or disdain, and who will eagerly comply.", "opposite", "any and all", "real", "expected", "Some readers might wonder: Can it really be that my daughter's eighth grade teacher, when she is extolling the merits of \"critical thinking\" on Parents' Night, is quietly announcing her intent to indoctrinate the children through some combination of Enlightenment empiricism and postmodern French philosophy?

Mr. Rogers was in Washington because President Nixon wanted to decrease his predecessor's proposed funding for public television from $20 million to $10 million. Pastore, who seemed to have prided himself on his own rigidity, was no match for a Presbyterian minister from Pittsburgh whose job it was to put people at ease on television.", "After explaining that he trusted the senator from Rhode Island to eventually read his own description of the theory behind his work, Mr. Rogers told Pastore that his program dealt with \"the inner drama of childhood,\" including events such as \"getting a haircut, or the feelings about brothers and sisters and the kind of anger that arises in simple family situations. And we speak to it constructively.\"", "Something must have struck Pastore when Mr. Rogers was describing his half-hour daily show: He asked to see an episode of the program. Mr. Rogers shared some lines that he kept on the backburner of his mind, but which he always managed to communicate with the enthusiasm of someone who had just discovered their truth: He shared with the senator that his audience hears, \"You've made this day a special day by just your being you,\" and that his viewers learn that \"feelings are mentionable and manageable.\"", "He concluded his testimony by sharing the lines of a song called \"What Do You Do With the Mad That You Feel?\" The lyrics are something of fervorino, encouraging listeners to see the good in self-knowledge, restraint, and maturity.

Girls are girls right from the start-if you were born a girl, you stay a girl and grow up to be a lady.\"", "Today's degenerates who view these truths as problematic did not have Mr. Rogers playing on their VCRs when they were growing up, I suppose-and, more importantly, did not have parents who did what Mr. Rogers did.

Mr. Rogers could have enjoyed a lucrative career in the private sphere and taught vacation bible school during his summers.

Her objective in Vermeer and the Art of Love is to explore Vermeer's wide-ranging, deeply revealing artistic treatment of the subject of love-love between a man and a woman and between man and God-together with its connections to poetry, music, and perhaps above all the visual arts.\u00a0", "Vermeer and the Art of Love", "The Vermeers she discusses depict women sometimes in moments of solitude-tuning or playing a musical instrument or reading or writing a letter, possibly from or to her lover-at other times in the presence of an actual or would-be lover, each time revealing some distinct aspect of the love relationship. The excited anticipation of the satisfaction of erotic desire to come, the wistful longing for her lover in his absence, the growing thrill of seduction by a music teacher or a soldier who comes calling, and above all, divine love-these are just a few of the emotions and ideas associated with love that are subtly but powerfully expressed through Vermeer's expert use of form and symbolism in his paintings.", "In the seemingly quotidian Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window, it is not made explicitly clear what the letter is about or who sent it. But the reproduced painting of Cupid by an unknown artist made to hang on the wall in the background gives us something to go on. As Georgievska-Shine explains, European artists, drawing upon an iconography rooted mainly in ancient Greco-Roman sources, particularly Ovid, had become accustomed to invoking Cupid as a conventional symbol of love. We may then reasonably conjecture that the letter is from a lover and perhaps even contains an avowal of love. Our conjecture is further supported by the look of total absorption mirrored in the girl's posture and face: a look that is impossible to imagine in connection with any strictly mundane news. But beyond that, we are left tantalizingly in the dark.", "Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window", "According to Georgievska-Shine, one especially noteworthy aspect of Vermeer's treatment of love is his undogmatic, non-moralizing approach to the subject. In this respect, he is distinctly different from other prominent contemporary Dutch artists, among them Jan Steen, who is preoccupied with eros outside the bounds of morality, and Pieter de Hooch, who often portrays morally upright eros.", "Take, for example, Officer and Laughing Girl. The foregrounded, largely silhouetted figure of the soldier, his back to the viewer, that dominates the painting's composition engenders, says Georgievska-Shine, \"an air of mystery.\" We are uncertain whether he is a hunter or conqueror attempting to seduce an unsuspecting young girl at the moment, so to speak, or a genuine Petrarchan courtier seeking but failing to bind himself for all time with his beloved. The redness of his coat bespeaks a robust erotic passion in him, which he may be seeking to satisfy immediately by charming her-successfully, judging by the apparent expression of delight on her face-with accounts of his adventures abroad possibly limned in the map hanging on the wall in the background (a leitmotif of Vermeer's paintings).\u00a0", "Officer and Laughing Girl", "Alternatively, the same map might be taken as a metaphor: a \"map of love,\" a source of guidance for the lover in his \"journey to the heart of the beloved.\" Instead of forcing the viewer to choose between these two interpretations of the soldier's intentions and the moral implications of each, Vermeer, says Georgievska-Shine, has our attention focused on the pure joy in his company the girl clearly evinces, making us wonder what she is \"listening to or ... imagining\" as he speaks. We are oblivious to the likelihood of her virtue being compromised in Vermeer's painting, in stark contrast to Pieter de Hooch's A Couple Playing Cards, with a Serving Woman, wherein, Georgievska-Shine argues, the signs all point unmistakably to a morally dubious outcome.", "A Couple Playing Cards, with a Serving Woman", "A pervasive theme of Georgievska-Shine's discussion is Vermeer's elusiveness and secretiveness. Consider his use in several paintings of such a seemingly innocuous object as a curtain. To return to the Girl Reading a Letter, the curtain on the right side of the picture frame conceals what Cupid is holding in his upraised left hand. Some visual images of Cupid in Vermeer's time, such as a couple of engravings by Otto van Veen, depict him as \"holding up a tablet inscribed with the number one, proclaiming the mutual devotion of lovers.\" In others, by contrast, he holds up the ring of Gyges, reminding us of the lover's capacity for duplicity. Because Cupid's left hand is hidden behind the curtain in the painting, we do not know whether it is holding \"the magic ring of duplicity or the card of faithfulness.\" The artist deliberately prevents us from ascertaining with certainty the nature and moral quality of the love relationship in question.", "Girl Reading a Letter", "To be sure, Cupid is also shown with \"two masks at his feet.\" Since, as Georgievska-Shine argues, the masks are meant to symbolize deception, it is \"as if the artist wanted to make sure the beholder will understand his message\" as one of true devotional love. Yet we cannot be sure, if only because of the love god's concealed left hand. (Although Georgievska-Shine then develops the further argument that the allusion to Gyges' ring may signify \"the deceptiveness of images,\" such as Vermeer's painting itself, and at the same time point to us beholders as \"invisible,\" \"clandestine\" Gyges-like figures gazing lovingly at the \"beautiful illusion [of a woman] that the painter has created for us.\")", "In Allegory of the Catholic Faith, the overarching theme of which is divine love, we see foregrounded on the left a tapestry curtain with all kinds of \"largely illegible forms,\" which Georgievska-Shine describes as a \"woven 'text' that simultaneously uncovers and obscures the larger image.\" One of those \"forms\" is an image, largely obscured by the curtain's folds, of a \"rider on horseback.\" Owing to the allegorical nature of the painting, one can safely infer that the rider is St. Paul and that the curtain is thus \"hinting at the Pauline obscurity of vision\" spoken of in 1 Corinthians 13:12 (\"For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully understood\").\u00a0", "Allegory of the Catholic Faith", "Georgievska-Shine wonders whether the image is a \"metaphor for a spiritual journey.\" Upon further analysis of the painting's symbolism, the spiritual journey proves, in her view, to be that of Catholics residing in a country where Calvinism is the established religion, who must gather together for prayer and worship in \"secret\" places. The presence of hidden meanings in Allegory symbolized by the curtain is confirmed by, among other things, the glass orb hanging from the ceiling, to which the gaze of the central figure-whom Georgievska-Shine describes as a fusion of Mary and Mary Magdalene and christens \"Faith\"-is directed: Barely visible on the orb is a reflection of a \"partially open window, possibly another signal of the veiled nature of knowledge.\" The \"reflective surface\" of the orb, Georgievska-Shine goes on to argue, can be understood to signify, in a veiled, metaphorical way, the painting in its entirety \"as a Pauline mirror that guides us from the visible towards that which defies understanding: the metaphysics of love.\"", "Allegory", "One may again come away from a first encounter with Vermeer's paintings thinking that in them form ministers to a purely naturalistic artistic aim: Formal elements of art such as line, color, texture, and shading are used to make the contents of the painting resemble, with near-photographic accuracy, things as we experience them in everyday life. However, as Georgievska-Shine points out, attentive observation discloses a strong \"classicizing\" tendency continuous with that of the Renaissance. The near-geometrical organization of the contents of his paintings along clearly recognizable vertical and horizontal lines, one of those classicizing features, prefigure the geometrical abstractions of twentieth-century Dutch modernist Piet Mondrian, for instance, his Broadway Boogie Woogie. But in Vermeer's case, classical form and order are made to serve the visual expression of higher human meanings, such as man's love of God, that cohere with a Christianity touched by neoplatonic philosophy. His artwork shows how the beauty of classical form and harmony can \"affect our soul\" in an edifying way.", "Broadway Boogie Woogie", "From detailed discussions and analyses like these, the reader can begin to perceive how the paintings relate to each other to form a coherent whole. The clear implication of the book is that Vermeer's \"art of love\" can be seen as a visually recreated cosmos of love that subtly reflects a cosmology with love as its ruling principle.", "Some of Georgievska-Shine's interpretations may strike the reader as doubtful, unclear, or far-fetched. But so erudite, detailed, and finely honed is her argument that intellectual integrity obliges us to carefully reread the entire book to ensure that such doubts do not stem from misunderstandings on our part.", "Georgievska-Shine's book brings to light love's many-sidedness and complexity-with stress on its more uplifting aspects-in Vermeer's rich visual portrayals. Mirroring Vermeer's artistic intention, which coincides with a more traditional, common-sense perspective on the subject, and contrary to the contemporary taste for debunking, Georgievska-Shine stands firmly on the essential and irreducible distinction between spiritual (or noble) and corporeal (or base) eros."], "headline": "Portrayals of Love", "timestamp": "", "act": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/portrayals-of-love/"}, "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/our-underincarceration-problem/": {"paras": ["Readers of headlines will, by now, have seen that Nayib Bukele's strongman war on gangs has gone very well.

This, of course, is a load of nonsense. There are toxic people, for sure. But masculinity - the qualities associated with being a man - is not in itself \"toxic.\" The articles claiming otherwise, however, most definitely are.", "Rollo Tomassi, a podcaster and writer who has been discussing the crisis of masculinity for years, told me that psychology is failing men because \"modern psychology is by women for women.\"\u00a0", "\"Across all fields,\" he noted, \"female doctoral students in psychology outnumber males by approximately three to one and have done so for over a decade.\" He's right.", "To compound matters, Tomassi added, \"the few notable men remaining in the field have pivoted away from the work that made them reputable. They now embrace a female-friendly bastardization of their prior works to avoid cancellation and losing tenure or struggle for relevance in an age where online self-help influencers replace them daily.\"", "Tomassi, who recently appeared on Dr. Phil to discuss the state of masculinity in America, said, \"Since the start of the Sexual Revolution, we've told men to 'man down'; yet modern psychology's prescription for men is to 'man up,' but only insofar as it benefits women's interests.\" All proposed male solutions are, in fact, \"gender-swapped female solutions.\"\u00a0", "Dr. Phil", "\"There cannot be a uniquely male solution, \" he concluded, \"largely because to do so would mean acknowledging fundamental differences in men's evolved psychologies.\" And we can't have that, can we?", "To make matters worse, even if a man in need is to go looking for psychological assistance, he'll likely find himself struggling to find an appropriate therapist.\u00a0Men prefer to be counseled by other men, but the field of psychology, as Tomassi pointed out,\u00a0 is currently dominated by females. Receiving therapy from a professional who matches one's sex is a significant predictor of satisfaction and therapeutic success.

Flying must have been an escape to Amelia. Her early flying teacher, the technicolor American character Neta Snook, upbraided Amelia for \"daydreaming\" during her lessons.

Earhart was iconic because she was played up that way, American style. Earhart played along, to great profit, as cigarette companies and clothing companies, magazine publishers and lecture-tour organizers cashed in on the image that they, and she, carefully cultivated. From the anonymity of distance-drunk America grew the quasi-intimate unfamiliarity of the movie star, the press darling, the magazine cover girl.", "In Amelia's case, she was pitched as a role model for young women, who leaned in to hang on Earhart's every word during her cross-country speaking gigs. Here is more distance in the making. Fleming, the Earhart biographer, noted that during Amelia's childhood it had been a big deal, something of a local scandal, when she and her sister were outfitted in bloomers instead of the standard nineteenth-century dresses. Women in Earhart's day were straited into old-line bourgeoisie sensibilities, and the rebel girls in airplanes were pure catnip for hothouse flowers such as these. If you were a secretary in a small town with dreams bigger than a Thornton Wilder play, then when Amelia Earhart barnstormed in you would be there, rapt, already flying away in the skies of your imagination.", "But there is more to Earhart's aviatrix branding than just these American unwindings of Victorian social mores.

Kengor avows that those who signed such petitions were \"doing Stalin's legwork,\" which is true.

The spread is similarly dismal across the country, with an average price disparity of nearly $9,000 between private insurance and Medicaid reimbursements.

Yanes's argument that \"the best available science\" demanded the sorts of mask policies we enacted was not true at any point in the pandemic.  ", "The idea that proponents of mask mandates were \"working for the welfare of the country\" while opponents were objecting for \"political, not health, reasons\" is the sort of thing you could only believe if you didn't see or care about the costs associated with forcing people to cover their faces in public. Thousands of children with speech impediments had their development retarded. Disabled adults lost social skills won slowly over the course of decades and were denied access to public places if they wouldn't keep a mask on their faces. Elderly men and women died surrounded by the half-covered faces of their children and grandchildren.
