      "Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor and likely presidential candidate, rallied Houston-area Republicans on Friday with a speech that proclaimed his state as Texas' new partner on the front lines in the battle against the political left.",
      "With Austin buzzing about an unspoken rivalry between the country's two biggest Republican-controlled states, DeSantis paid homage to Texas' boisterous self-image - and said Florida is gaining its own \"big sense of pride\" under his leadership. He said it is being noticed \"all the way up to the fella in the White House,\" referring to his potential opponent in 2024: President Joe Biden.",
      "\"They know you don't mess with Texas - and you don't tread on Florida,\" DeSantis said. \"I really believe if it hasn't been for Texas and Florida playing the role we have in this country in recent history, our entire country would be one big woke, neo-Marxist Dumpster fire.\"",
      "DeSantis' remarks at the annual Harris County Lincoln Reagan Dinner were part of a two-day swing through Texas that will also include a similar event Saturday for the Dallas County GOP. The events come as DeSantis increasingly travels outside Florida in advance of an anticipated bid against former President Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.",
      "Texas' own governor, Greg Abbott, has not ruled out his own White House bid, fueling the notion of a budding competition between the two megastates.",
      "Greg Abbott",
      "DeSantis hardly mentioned Abbott, but his speech was filled with flattering references to Texas and its recent efforts to lead the way nationally on conservative policy. It was a far cry from the tone adopted by Abbott's intraparty critics, who see DeSantis as a stronger fighter for their causes.",
      "Instead, DeSantis spoke multiple times about the two states as new equals in a culture war, invoking the Alamo as he promised to \"never, ever surrender to the woke mob.\"",
      "\"The state of Florida - and the state of Texas - is where woke goes to die,\" DeSantis said, refashioning a line from his January inaugural address to include the Lone Star State.",
      "Still, DeSantis was not afraid to trumpet Florida - and himself. He said he made his state a \"refuge of sanity\" during the COVID-19 pandemic, spurning federal pressure to keep the state shut down and perhaps, he added, showing \"our own form of Texas swagger.\" And referring to more recent events, he bragged that Florida was the only state brave enough to publicly oppose the draft curriculum of a new Advanced Placement course in African American Studies.",
      "publicly oppose",
      "DeSantis also boasted about his two gubernatorial elections. He said that even though he won with only 50% of the vote in 2018, he \"earned 100% of the executive power, and I intend to use it to advance our agenda, to stand up for the people I represent and make good on my campaign promises.\"",
      "\"I am just not going to be a potted plant and let the left determine the shape of the debate, let the media shape the debate,\" DeSantis said. \"I'm going on offense.\"",
      "That approach, DeSantis said, led to his blowout reelection win last year, declaring the Florida Democratic Party \"dead\" as a result.",
      "The Houston dinner was closed to the media, keeping with DeSantis' hostility toward traditional journalists. But at least one attendee broadcast DeSantis' speech live on Facebook, and The Texas Tribune separately obtained an audio recording of it. The Dallas event will also be closed to the media.",
      "In Dallas, DeSantis also will appear at a yearly fundraising dinner for the county party, but it will be a different format than the speech he gave in Houston. It has been billed as a \"fireside chat\" between DeSantis and his wife, Casey DeSantis, who is one of his closest political advisers.",
      "Proceeds from the fundraising dinners benefit the county parties, but they also give DeSantis a large audience with activists and donors in two cities that are home to some of the party's biggest contributors nationwide. DeSantis was expected to privately meet with donors on the sidelines of both Texas events.",
      "During his speech in Houston, DeSantis mentioned one top donor to Texas Republicans by name - Dick Weekley - saying Florida was working to catch up to Texas on Weekley's longtime cause, tort reform.",
      "DeSantis was introduced in Houston by state Sen. Brandon Creighton, R-Conroe, chairman of the Senate Education Committee. Creighton traveled to Tallahassee in December to meet with DeSantis about education issues.",
      "Sen. Brandon Creighton",
      "Creighton lavished praise on DeSantis but also emphasized what the Texas Senate is prioritizing this session. He nodded to one of Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick's priorities, saying Texas \"will stand against the teaching of critical race theory by woke tenured professors.\"",
      "Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick",
      "Creighton was most emphatic about a priority of both Patrick and Abbott: a \"school choice\" program that would redirect tax revenue to let parents take their kids out of public schools.",
      "\"This Texas legislative session, we will make clear that Texas parents have the rights they deserve in the public school classroom and with alternative education opportunities and with tax dollars that belong to families, not the government,\" Creighton said.",
      "Florida already has a suite of school-choice programs, and in his speech, DeSantis wished Texas luck in \"bringing a big school-choice package across the finish line.\"",
      "school-choice programs",
      "The lineups for both the Houston and Dallas events also included U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Austin, a sign of his higher profile statewide since he served as a key negotiator for conservatives on Kevin McCarthy's ascension to House speaker in January.",
      "U.S. Rep. Chip Roy",
      "Abbott was not expected to attend DeSantis' appearances. He was in San Antonio on Friday and set to appear in Austin on Saturday to address a conservative legal group at the University of Texas.",

      "Similarly, before the 2016 election, less than 25 percent of Republicans said the economy was getting better; more than 75 percent said it was getting worse. ",
      "before the 2016 election",
      "As soon as the election happened, though, those numbers changed dramatically. Suddenly almost 50 percent of Republicans thought the economy was getting better, while a slightly smaller number than that said it was getting worse.",
      "Obviously, the economy didn't change that much in the week after the election. What changed were partisan signals. When Trump was in control, Republicans told pollsters the economy was better, while Democrats told pollsters the economy was worse. ",
      "The fact that partisanship drives economic polling, rather than the economy driving partisanship, is well known now. And it's even more salient as partisanship has increased and strengthened over the last years. It should be taken into account in media reporting and narratives.",
      "increased and strengthened",
      "But it rarely is. For example, in 2016, the media was obsessed with the idea that Trump voters were being driven by economic anxiety. ",
      "But numerous retrospective studies showed that there was little correlation between economic distress and support for Trump. ",
      "little correlation between economic distress and support for Trump",
      "Trump voters chose Trump for partisan reasons-because he was a Republican, because he embodied their enthusiasm for white, male, Christian identity politics. ",
      "But Republican talking points focused on economic anxiety. So voters signaled their partisanship to pollsters by saying the economy was doing poorly.",
      "Despite the evidence that media narratives were wrong or confused in 2016, you can see the same thing happening again in 2022. The media looks at polls saying that voters are concerned about inflation and the economy, and says that poor economic performance is bad for Democrats.",
      "Inflation does materially affect people, and disruptions from Covid and the war in Ukraine are real. There is plenty of reason to be concerned about the economy at a time of global uncertainty and conflict.",
      "But those concerns don't necessarily translate into voting choices.",
      "For instance, in the New York Times article on their own poll, the reporter interviews Robin Ackerman, a 37-year-old mortgage loan officer who said she was a Democrat. ",
      "Ackerman supports abortion rights. But she said, \"I'm shifting more towards Republican because I feel like they're more geared towards business.\" ",
      "said",
      "The vague gesture towards \"business\" doesn't really sound like someone who is worried about the economy and is going to vote Republican. It sounds like someone who has decided to vote for the GOP, and is therefore referencing partisan GOP pro-business talking points to justify or rationalize that choice.",
      "So, if the economy isn't necessarily driving voter choice, what is?",
      "The probable answer is simply that the incumbent party has a large structural disadvantage in midterm elections. According to FiveThirtyEight, the president's party has performed about 7.4 points worse in the midterm elections than in the previous presidential election.",
      "performed",
      "Based on those numbers you'd expect Democrats to lose the House (which they won by 3 in 2020). They might be able to hold the Senate this year because of the very poor quality of Republican candidates.",
      "Why do voters turn on the incumbent president? Political scientists are unsure, but the best explanation is probably \"balancing.\" ",
      "balancing",
      "Voters, perhaps pushed by a press obsessed with both sides messaging, tend to worry that a president has gone too far to the left or the right. They vote for the out party to get what they see as more moderate outcomes.",
      "both sides messaging",
      "The Dobbs decision, one of the most sweeping right-wing policy victories of the last twenty years at least, has somewhat undermined the narrative that the country is moving too far left. So has the continued prominence of Donald Trump in the news, a constant reminder of what the Republicans would do if in power.",
      "These factors have helped keep Democrats more competitive in midterm polls than would be expected. Republicans are still only about .5 points ahead on the generic congressional ballot according to 538's poll aggregator, rather than the 4-point lead you'd expect based on previous midterms.",
      "538's poll aggregator",
      "Still, the swing towards the out party as the midterm approaches is powerful. The Democrats are fighting against long-term structural factors which have shaped elections for decades.",
      "Those factors are pushing voters towards Republicans-and when voters move towards Republicans, they tend to say they're concerned about the economy, because that's what Republican partisan leaders are emphasizing.",
      "But it's not the economy driving the partisanship. It's partisanship driving economic concerns. ",
      "Which means that the problem isn't really that Democrats are out of touch on the economy, or aren't appealing to working-class voters. The problem is that many voters continue to behave as they have in the past, despite the GOP's escalating extremism and escalating attack on democracy. ",
      "escalating attack on democracy",
      "This dynamic is very dangerous for our democracy, and it's difficult to know how to address it. But if we are ever going to do so, it's important to understand that economic anxiety is not what's driving the backlash. ",

Jordan has promised that Democrats need to be very afraid of the 'whistleblowers' he would be unveiling in connection with the Weaponization Subcommittee.

      "U.S. Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-San Antonio, is digging in as he faces a potential censure by the Republican Party of Texas over his recent positions breaking with the party.",
      "Tony Gonzales",
      "The party's executive committee is set to hold a quarterly meeting Saturday where it will consider a censure resolution that cites a few of the notable ways in which Gonzales has split from his party in recent months. Those include his rejection of a border security proposal by his fellow Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy, and his support of a bill defending same-sex marriage protections and a bipartisan gun law that passed in response to the Uvalde school shooting in his district.",
      "Chip Roy",
      "\"What censure?\" Gonzales said when asked about it by reporters Thursday in San Antonio. \"Has a censure taken place? I think they're gonna vote on it Saturday, and we'll see how that goes.\"",
      "Gonzales added - as he has before - that he has no regrets about supporting the gun safety law, which expanded background checks, among other things. He was the only House Republican from Texas to support the measure - and one of only 14 nationwide.",
      "\"If the vote was today,\" Gonzales said, \"I would vote twice on it if I could.\"",
      "Gonzales does not plan to attend the meeting Saturday. He noted he is leading a congressional delegation to the Mexican border in Eagle Pass - as well as Uvalde - on Monday. And he sought Thursday to shift the spotlight to issues on which Republicans are more unified, attending a news conference to oppose a San Antonio ballot proposition that would decriminalize abortion.",
      "The movement to censure Gonzales is the latest twist in his short but action-packed political career. It began in 2020 when he won a primary runoff that went to a recount and then beat the odds to keep the 23rd District under GOP control. Then redistricting made the seat redder for the 2022 election, and he had to navigate a unique race that served as a referendum on his independent streak. He won by double digits.",
      "referendum on his independent streak",
      "But the intraparty sniping has not subsided, especially as Gonzales has vocally opposed the border security bill from Roy, which would give the secretary of Homeland Security the power to bar border crossings and detain asylum-seekers while their cases are processed in court.",
      "The censure resolution that the State Republican Executive Committee is set to consider originated from Medina County, which passed it last month and requested the state party take it up. Fifteen other counties in Gonzales' sprawling district have since approved concurring resolutions.",
      "Three-fifths of the 64-member State Republican Executive Committee would have to approve the resolution Saturday. If the resolution passes, it would allow the state party to get involved in Gonzales' primary, including by spending its funds to inform voters of the censure. The party is normally required to remain neutral in intraparty contests.",
      "The state party said it believes that the only other time it approved a censure under this method was against former state House Speaker Joe Straus in 2018. He was also a moderate from San Antonio.",
      "Joe Straus",
      "The Medina County resolution alleges Gonzales violated the principles of the party by voting for the gun law and opposing Roy's border legislation. It also cites Gonzales' vote last year for a bill to codify same-sex marriage, plus his lonely vote against the U.S. House rules package in January, which made it easier to remove the speaker and made it hearder to raise taxes, among other things.",
      "Gonzales scoffed Thursday at his opposition to the rules package, which was the product of painstaking negotiations with House conservatives to allow Kevin McCarthy to become speaker. Gonzales questioned a reporter on whether he understood the rules package, dismissing it as \"so inside baseball.\"",
      "\"The reality is I've taken almost 1,400 votes, and the bulk of those have been with the Republican Party,\" Gonzales said.",
      "Gonzales defended his support for the same-sex marriage bill last year, telling The Texas Tribune that it \"wasn't a tough vote\" and that Republicans need to accept same-sex marriage if the party wants to grow.",
      "telling The Texas Tribune",
      "The Roy border bill has been the biggest flashpoint recently. Gonzales has stood firm against it, arguing it would effectively end asylum. Roy has denied that.",
      "That has led to a budding rivalry between Gonzales and Roy, complete with thinly veiled threats from allied groups to field a primary challenger against Gonzales.",
      "Gonzales took a fresh swipe at Roy on Thursday while touting how he has voted with the GOP most of the time. A day earlier, Roy was one of only four Republicans to oppose a bill to require estimates of the inflationary impact of President Joe Biden's executive orders. Roy said he objected to the proposal because it did not apply to \"'emergency' orders that are some of the primary drivers of inflation.\"",
      "\"Just yesterday, I voted to hold Biden accountable for inflation,\" Gonzales said. \"Not all Republicans voted in favor of ensuring that.\"",
      "That the opposition to Gonzales would originate in Medina County is unsurprising. The county, which is west of San Antonio, is home to Raul Reyes, Gonzales' 2020 primary runoff opponent, who remains a bitter critic.",

It cited his support for the bipartisan gun law that passed last year, as well as his vote for a bill codifying protections for same-sex marriage. The resolution also pointed to his vote against the House rules package in January and his opposition to a border security bill being pushed by fellow Texas GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Austin.",

      "During an appearance on MSNBC on Saturday morning, noted historian Michael Beschloss was asked about Donald Trump's drive for a third GOP presidential nomination which then led to him to question the former president's fitness to run while also comparing him to a cockroach.",
      "Speaking with fill-in host Michael Steele, Beschloss grew animated when talking about the former president's ability to be held to account for his offenses and suggested the threat of multiple indictments could impact the former president's health.",
      "\"Now we haven't ever seen a president potentially indicted like this, and maybe dealing with serious multiple indictments from various places, various judicial agencies,\" he exclaimed. \"That's something we haven't seen before.\"",
      "\"Even Donald Trump, who has the survival abilities of a cockroach, I'm not sure if he can withstand if he is potentially indicted, and we don't know that this is gonna happen,\" he continued.",
      "He elaborated, \"But let's say in three different venues, at the same time, you know, that's a lot to ask of anyone -- especially someone in his late 70s, and may not be the most physically fit person at that age that I've ever seen.\"",

      "Some polls are showing that the Republicans are edging out the Democrats in a midterm election cycle that already favors the Republicans. These polls are jim-jamming nervous white liberals.",
      "Why? Obviously, it has a lot to do with winning and losing. But it has more to do with certain expectations, I think, that white liberals have of other white people. The options are clear: a party that can govern or a party that can bulldoze, to borrow Jonathan Bernstein's framing.",
      "But here we are with polls showing that the Republicans are advancing in generic Democrat-or-Republican opinion surveys. ",

      "To white liberals, democracy itself is on the ballot. That's what the president said. Anyway, Americans are supposed to believe in democracy. Yet a white majority, in swing states like Pennsylvania, seems ready to put the fascists in power, democracy be damned.",
      "Beneath it all is something else that's working white liberals' last good nerve: despair - or the dread-awe of discovering that white people, whom you thought would make the good choice if it were clear, have found reasons to make the bad choice. ",
      "The people whom you thought were not racist - anyway, not as racist as The Racists - are turning out to be exquisitely receptive to the GOP's midterm messaging: vote for us and we'll save you the effort of having to compete with nonwhite people putting in twice the effort. Vote for us and we'll re-rig the system so you get the best cuts.",

      "Democrats see 'ominous signs' and are becoming worried about Florida as midterms approach: report",
      "Democracy is hard work in the end. Voting for Republicans, however, is easy-peasy. White people already have political advantages. The GOP is just protecting them. Even so, white liberals seem to be let down by a majority of white people who are turning out to be as racist as nonwhite people have said they would be. The feeling grows deeper knowing that racism is the lazy American's road to tyranny.",
      "Bu bu but what about the economy? ",
      "To be sure, polls have found that large numbers of voters are worried about \"the economy\" more than they are about the endurance of democracy and the fall of Roe. \"The economy\" just so happens to be the same talking point that the Republicans are pitching. There's also the none-too-suble hint that Democrats stand against white people. Put these together and it looks - I am shocked - like recent polling.",
      "Inflation is a serious thing, but it's not due to anything that the Democrats did or didn't. (It's related to the covid pandemic, supply chains and the war in Ukraine.) But since there's a public cost to supporting someone who has no business running for the US Senate (ie, Mehmet Oz), it's better to cite another reason, any reason. Inflation is visible and, well, it's enough to fool even oneself.",
      "All this points to the problem of hope.",
      "Hope is anarchical, and it tempts us from the future. We go to it. Hope isn't a story with an anticipated and emotionally satisfying end. Even so, white liberals tend to believe, I think, that racism is a figment of history, not a precursor informing our vision of the present. Such a story tells of an America purified of its original sin, so that we can believe in it again. Take that away, what do you have? ",
      "Whatever it is, it's not hope.",
      "Hope is almost certainly not what we think it will be. We almost certainly won't recognize it, though it may be right in front of us. I think hope is rooted in lived experiences of human lives, and in their consequences, and in a particular time and particular place. Hope is, as in Hebrews 11:1, a political exercise in religion: \"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\" ",
      "White liberals are telling themselves a story about democracy and what's at stake in these midterms. It's not that that's wrong, but that's also not right. Stories are tools of politics, not politics itself. What matters is doing the work to get preferred candidates elected. It's messy, loud, and anarchical. Democracy is almost always like that.",
      "Even if the Republicans take the House, democracy will not end. America is not one nation. It will endure where the people want it to. It may wither where the people want it to. Democracy will live on, though it may be in form rather than in spirit, because the GOP is by nature prone to keeping up appearances. Even in a desiccated husk of democracy is hope. From there, good people can do good work.",
      "The most democratic thing we can do is presume that the polls are wrong, raise a lotta hell and get out the vote. Democracy is an open practice, not a theory alone. When time comes, put in the work and create quality conditions for self-rule. Oh, and one more thing.",
      "Hope we are lucky.",

It would be patently false given the administration's attempts to pass a robust Build Back Better bill aimed squarely at low-income earners' pocketbooks. ",
      "But I would like to venture another explanation: our nation is wallowing in growing economic inequality, weak social services, rising healthcare costs, unsteady gig jobs and weak labor unions. ",

      "Globally, America is one of the higher-income nations as measured by median income. Objectively speaking, we seem to be doing well. But this is a matter of perspective - not raw numbers. ",

",
      "This anxiety can make people receptive to emotional appeals from politicians claiming to identify with them, creating scapegoats to direct their pain toward, and then making empty promises to alleviate that anxiety. Scholars (including me) have been using this to explain the rise of Trump and MAGA populism on the right.",
      "But I am talking about a recharacterization of what the soul of America as a nation is right now. I am talking about extending the MAGA explanation outward to all of us. We are not a nation of middle-class strivers that made us the envy of the world. We are an anxious people now. That means we will put prices over principles.",

In other words, candidates ... wrap a dozen different issues into one coherent class war story.",
      "I might quibble with some of the examples Brooks gives. Do Republicans talk that much about fentanyl deaths? Is fake news still a viable topic post-Trump? But I agree with the general point that Republicans are on the ascendant, because of a false narrative that Democrats ignore the concerns of everyday people. ",
      "Never mind that the ultimate cause of economic insecurity in the United States can be tied to Republican initiatives. They are antagonistic to unions - the presence of which has historically been associated with higher incomes and job benefits, like healthcare and maternity leave. They resist investment in social services. Programs that fund childcare do not put money directly into the hands of people but decrease family outlays, freeing up money for other purposes. For the past 50 years, they have championed a tax regime that would supposedly lift all boats by cutting taxes on the rich. All it did was sink the middle class and buy the wealthy a few more yachts. Never mind all that. ",
