      "Until May anyway, all five feet and one inch of Lori Lightfoot\u2019s dainty frame still sits in the seat of Richard Daley. In the city of broad shoulders, where hogs more mammoth than the mayor were deconstructed in the vicious abattoirs made famous by Upton Sinclair, Lightfoot is set to exit the stage at a time when many wonder if that is true of Chicago itself, too.\u00a0",
      "Lightfoot was left for dead by that Democratic machine politician, President Joe Biden. She was cut loose, as well, by Illinois's governor, the oligarch J.B. Pritzer. She is, by most accounts, positively reviled. All that was on display in her third place finish in Tuesday\u2019s re-election effort.\u00a0",
      "Lightfoot garnered less than 20 percent of the vote. Those are Francois Hollande numbers. But on a human level, the scale of the achievement of this black, lesbian, urban Nguyen Sinh Cung should not be given short shrift. Lightfoot reached a zenith in the land of the Daley dynasty, both Michael and Richard. Lightfoot was commandant of a political labyrinth that once had the power to swat away a young Barack Obama like a summer cicada\u2014and did, with considerable relish.\u00a0",
      "Lightfoot was an heir to Harold Washington, the Windy City's first black mayor. Washington was, for Obama and many other black men during his tenure in the '80s, another father figure he didn't really know. From College Park to Hyde Park, Washington\u2019s tenure saw cocaine snatch out the heart of black America. Innuendo, never proved, that dope snuffed out Washington\u2019s life too would dog his legacy, just as innuendo dogs all former mayors of Chicago.\u00a0",
      "Chicago is where the nascent Republican Party made Abraham Lincoln its nominee for president. This was the year before the local kid embarked the young country upon the bloody brother war, as Johnny Cash called it. Like modern Italy, born in tandem with Cosa nostra, Chicago\u2019s appetite for spectacle and combat has been seemingly eternal.\u00a0",
      "Cosa nostra, ",
      "As if to even the scales, four years later in Chicago, Democrats nominated crypto-confederate Garden Stater George McClellan, the dashing former commanding general of the U.S. Army. As Christopher Hitchens liked to recount at his home in D.C. overlooking the McClellan statue (facing south), Lincoln famously asked to borrow the armed forces because McClellan seemed to have no use for them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
      "Chicago is where President Warren Harding was nominated. Better known now for running a gangster\u2019s paradise in Washington City, this product of the Midwest is the man who brought Americans home, coastal protestations aside. Harding\u2019s own internal tour of the country in the last year of his life was dubbed the \u201cVoyage of Understanding,\u201d which is certainly the kind of open mind and lack of moral presumptuousness required to understand Chicago politics.\u00a0",
      "And Chicago is where Franklin Delano Roosevelt broke George Washington\u2019s great taboo, and was successfully nominated for a third term as president\u2014while over in Europe, Adolf Hitler blitzed London. In 1968, Chicago is where the former party of Jefferson and Jackson gathered to nominate a commander-in-chief to see out a war its own members and own president stopped believing in. There, the Democrats rioted. They were done, \u201cmaybe forever,\u201d Roger Sterling quipped, with a characteristic lack of prescience.\u00a0",
      " ",
      "These days, the mean streets 700 miles northwest of the Beltway are best known nationally as: \u201cChiraq.\u201d That is no homage to the president of the Fifth Republic who opposed the American suicide mission embarked upon twenty years ago. But rather, as all know, it refers to the vestiges of the \"State Department: Level 4 travel advisory\" country itself.\u00a0",
      "Chicago is a city of killers. This mayor\u2019s self-assessment was rather more priapic than murderous. And for a brief moment on Lake Michigan, Lori Lightfoot was the biggest of them.",
      "Bear that in mind. So...what now?\u00a0",
      "In the invincibly forgotten early 2010s show Boss, Kelsey Grammer portrays the archetypal Chicago city executive as an impressive and intimidatingly self-aware master of the dark arts. \u201cI am a bad man,\u201d Grammer\u2019s Mayor Tom Kane explains. \u201cOne necessary evil leads to another until one day you can\u2019t differentiate between what\u2019s necessary and what\u2019s merely expedient.\u201d",
      "Boss",
      "As Boss revealed in short order, the mayor was concealing a diagnosis of Lewy body dementia, and privately knew he was symptomatic. Perhaps an in-joke for my old college row house who watched this thing, Kane\u2019s essential posture throughout the show was: \u201cI am the mayor of this g*ddamned city.\u201d Similar sentiments have been expressed about Detroit. And so Mayor Kane pressed on, with no similarities at all with that other Irish backslapper, the president of this country.\u00a0",
      "Boss",
      "no similarities at all",
      "I quite like and want to root for Chicago. A maiden approach on Lake Shore Drive is as impressive as almost any speed-through in America, bested only by taking in the New York skyline from New Jersey, and of course, seeing California for the first time. The alluring, opal-black cityscape one can take in from afar leaves no doubt: Chicago is the real Gotham, not Manhattan.",
      "That is not fully a compliment. Its balefulness can be seductive. Lightfoot herself stole a script page from Batman, reportedly marshaling the political power of prisoners this cycle to her advantage.",
      "Batman",
      "The Midwest was once the heart of this country\u2019s frontier promise, and then a century later, center stage for its middle class stability. Relative optimists like Aaron Renn believe Chicago could be the focal point of a second Midwestern century, at least as affordability is concerned. Still, even for those who desire such an outcome, it is searing to see how the problems for Chicago and the Midwest mirror that of the Kremlin in the `90s\u2014the brain drain, the hope to be a relative winner of whatever climate change, and so on.\u00a0The attendant danger is also parallel with Russia: of greater parochialism, insularity, isolation, and ballistic criminality. ",
      "The great Midwestern states have started voting Republican not because things are going well. They have done so because they have been forsaken by the powerful. The optimistic case for Chicago has to contend with the more plausible reality: that the great city of white ethnics is in the process of being cut down to size, a process the WASPs underwent a generation earlier.\u00a0",
      "After Rahm Emanuel left the White House to become Chicago mayor, he all but explicitly remarked that the nature of this job meant he would never become president, as if he had made a career jump to pornography. Still, Chicago used to be considered very cool, as late as the early 2010s, when Obama made it once again world-famous. That sentiment was bipartisan, and the University of Chicago was emblematic: serious academic liberalism, but paired with a reputation for tough grading and no-nonsense libertarianism for the right.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
      "All that is mostly gone now, as most media elites are loath to pump a freezing cold oasis of liberalism in a region that has started voting GOP. Meanwhile, the right has no real love lost for the place, as its most ambitious young minds have given the legacy of Milton Friedman\u00a0its own Pinochet treatment. And Chicago\u2019s descent in the national imagination is likely to only intensify whenever President Biden leaves the scene, as his tenure is a last hurrah for a certain kind of Irish American politician.\u00a0",
      "Mayor Emanuel\u2019s tenure was reviled by informed writers with Second City roots, namely historian of conservatism Rick Perlstein and historian of populism Thomas Frank. In 2015, there was a pre-Sanders Era leftist effort to oust Emanuel: the failed project to elect Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia. Chuy is now a Congressman and ran again this year. Lightfoot spent much of her campaign savaging him, all in the service of her finishing third and he fourth. Say what you will for \u201cMAGA,\u201d Donald Trump at least became the president.\u00a0",
      "As could be said of the Sanders movement coast-to-coast, it is occasionally difficult to discern what the point all was.\u00a0To say nothing of the already left-wing tilt of all America\u2019s ruling institutions, the Sandernista energy is particularly curious when, in the end, figures like Lightfoot came in succession of Emanuel, who did not run in 2018 after a long run as bete noire of the Windy City\u2019s left. Only in the throes of middle-aged peer jealousy could someone even begin to make an argument that Emanuel was worse at the job than Lightfoot\u2014all send-ups to her Boss Tweed skills in the game aside.\u00a0",
      "bete noire ",
      "Who, frankly, would step into this farrago?\u00a0",
      "Two names are now on offer in the early April runoff. Paul Vallas, the former Chicago Public Schools CEO who has tacked strongly to a law-and-order message, and Cook County board member Brandon Johnson.\u00a0In reverse order, Jonathan Martin smuggled this chestnut into Politico, on Johnson: \u201cThe son of a pastor who grew up in Chicago\u2019s suburbs, as some of his critics are eager to point out, Johnson has caught on with the city\u2019s younger and most progressive voters \u2014 the sort of person on the North Side\u2019s Roscoe Street who has side by side; \u2018Johnson for Mayor\u2019 and \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 signs in front of a million-dollar home.\u201d",
      "Politico",
      "Though Vallas has a background in education, his record is that of a disruptor (for lack of a better word) of entrenched interests, at least as far as the teachers\u2019 machine goes. Vallas here will reprise the role of the technical non-Republican in city politics (a critique also of his enemies). It was last prominently exhibited by the milquetoast, but thoroughly able tenure of Michael Bloomberg in New York, and more demoralizing: the Rick Caruso campaign in Los Angeles last year.\u00a0",
      "On the race at hand, Obama\u2019s old wizard, the great David Axelrod said to the hometown press: This will be a battle of \u201cthe candidate of the Fraternal Order of Police\u201d against the \u201ccandidate of the Chicago Teachers Union.\u201d",
      "The last time I was in town, right before the grim \u201cdouble dip\u201d Delta late summer of 2021, I took in the sights on the always perplexingly long journey from O\u2019Hare. On the road was an advertisement, replete with the photogenic visages of the former first couple, for the Obama Center, which broke ground that fall. The Obamas, of course, had to be neo-bullied into putting the place in Michelle Robinson\u2019s city of birth, and the political staging ground for the 44th president, at all.",
      "As has been subtly admitted, the Obama Center is not even a real presidential library. Still, its inauguration was feted as a point of pride for Chicago locals, and rather understandably so, at a time when so many other institutions have left the place. But the message just below the surface was clear: The good get out.\u00a0"

      "Vermeer and the Art of Love, by Aneta Georgievska-Shine, Lund Humphries, 160 pages. ",
      ", by Aneta Georgievska-Shine, Lund Humphries, 160 pages. ",
      "Johannes Vermeer, the seventeenth-century Dutch artist of the \u201cfine painter\u201d school, led a private life. He rarely left his hometown, Delft; exceedingly little is known about him apart from the fact that he married a Catholic woman, may have converted to her faith, and had eleven surviving children. He apparently produced only two paintings a year for two decades. After his death, Vermeer passed into near-oblivion for almost two centuries. In the latter part of the nineteenth century, however, Vermeer's star began to rise again, and it has not stopped rising since. In recent years, Vermeer\u2019s popularity has only grown, thanks to the work of contemporary art historians and the sensibility of modern audiences.",
      "Dr. Aneta Georgievska-Shine is an art historian of impressive scope. She studied with Arthur Wheelock, the leading American Vermeer scholar and curator of the landmark exhibition at the NGA, in 1995\u201396. She has previously brought her expertise to bear on two studies of Peter Paul Rubens\u2019s mythological works; she has now produced an outstanding monograph on the art of Vermeer. While the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam is exhibiting the most significant number of Vermeer paintings ever assembled this spring, Georgievska-Shine\u2019s book is a perfect guide to the works in the exhibition or the next best thing for those who can't make the trip.",
      "Georgievska-Shine\u2019s book has two parts. In the first part, she gives us a tour of Dutch genre painting in the mid-seventeenth century, showing how this artistic culture shaped Vermeer's subject matter, characters, and situations. In the second, \u201cVermeer's Difference,\" she convincingly argues that \"his visions of that Dutch reality seem a world apart from\" those of his fellow painters. His marked superiority to most Dutch painters of his time was less in technical virtuosity than in form and meaning.",
      "A quick first survey of his works can give the impression that Vermeer was primarily a genre painter whose main interest was women in domestic life\u2014writing and reading letters, knitting, playing a musical instrument, and the like.",
      "Like other contemporary scholars of seventeenth-century Dutch art, Georgievska-Shine shows that there is much more to Vermeer than that. Her objective in Vermeer and the Art of Love is to explore Vermeer's wide-ranging, deeply revealing artistic treatment of the subject of love\u2014love between a man and a woman and between man and God\u2014together with its connections to poetry, music, and perhaps above all the visual arts.\u00a0",
      "Vermeer and the Art of Love",
      "The Vermeers she discusses depict women sometimes in moments of solitude\u2014tuning or playing a musical instrument or reading or writing a letter, possibly from or to her lover\u2014at other times in the presence of an actual or would-be lover, each time revealing some distinct aspect of the love relationship. The excited anticipation of the satisfaction of erotic desire to come, the wistful longing for her lover in his absence, the growing thrill of seduction by a music teacher or a soldier who comes calling, and above all, divine love\u2014these are just a few of the emotions and ideas associated with love that are subtly but powerfully expressed through Vermeer's expert use of form and symbolism in his paintings.",
      "In the seemingly quotidian Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window, it is not made explicitly clear what the letter is about or who sent it. But the reproduced painting of Cupid by an unknown artist made to hang on the wall in the background gives us something to go on. As Georgievska-Shine explains, European artists, drawing upon an iconography rooted mainly in ancient Greco-Roman sources, particularly Ovid, had become accustomed to invoking Cupid as a conventional symbol of love. We may then reasonably conjecture that the letter is from a lover and perhaps even contains an avowal of love. Our conjecture is further supported by the look of total absorption mirrored in the girl\u2019s posture and face: a look that is impossible to imagine in connection with any strictly mundane news. But beyond that, we are left tantalizingly in the dark.",
      "Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window",
      "According to Georgievska-Shine, one especially noteworthy aspect of Vermeer's treatment of love is his undogmatic, non-moralizing approach to the subject. In this respect, he is distinctly different from other prominent contemporary Dutch artists, among them Jan Steen, who is preoccupied with eros outside the bounds of morality, and Pieter de Hooch, who often portrays morally upright eros.",
      "Take, for example, Officer and Laughing Girl. The foregrounded, largely silhouetted figure of the soldier, his back to the viewer, that dominates the painting's composition engenders, says Georgievska-Shine, \u201can air of mystery.\u201d We are uncertain whether he is a hunter or conqueror attempting to seduce an unsuspecting young girl at the moment, so to speak, or a genuine Petrarchan courtier seeking but failing to bind himself for all time with his beloved. The redness of his coat bespeaks a robust erotic passion in him, which he may be seeking to satisfy immediately by charming her\u2014successfully, judging by the apparent expression of delight on her face\u2014with accounts of his adventures abroad possibly limned in the map hanging on the wall in the background (a leitmotif of Vermeer's paintings).\u00a0",
      "Officer and Laughing Girl",
      "Alternatively, the same map might be taken as a metaphor: a \u201cmap of love,\u201d a source of guidance for the lover in his \u201cjourney to the heart of the beloved.\u201d Instead of forcing the viewer to choose between these two interpretations of the soldier\u2019s intentions and the moral implications of each, Vermeer, says Georgievska-Shine, has our attention focused on the pure joy in his company the girl clearly evinces, making us wonder what she is \u201clistening to or \u2026 imagining\u201d as he speaks. We are oblivious to the likelihood of her virtue being compromised in Vermeer\u2019s painting, in stark contrast to Pieter de Hooch\u2019s A Couple Playing Cards, with a Serving Woman, wherein, Georgievska-Shine argues, the signs all point unmistakably to a morally dubious outcome.",
      "A Couple Playing Cards, with a Serving Woman",
      "A pervasive theme of Georgievska-Shine\u2019s discussion is Vermeer\u2019s elusiveness and secretiveness. Consider his use in several paintings of such a seemingly innocuous object as a curtain. To return to the Girl Reading a Letter, the curtain on the right side of the picture frame conceals what Cupid is holding in his upraised left hand. Some visual images of Cupid in Vermeer\u2019s time, such as a couple of engravings by Otto van Veen, depict him as \u201cholding up a tablet inscribed with the number one, proclaiming the mutual devotion of lovers.\u201d In others, by contrast, he holds up the ring of Gyges, reminding us of the lover's capacity for duplicity. Because Cupid\u2019s left hand is hidden behind the curtain in the painting, we do not know whether it is holding \u201cthe magic ring of duplicity or the card of faithfulness.\u201d The artist deliberately prevents us from ascertaining with certainty the nature and moral quality of the love relationship in question.",
      "Girl Reading a Letter",
      "To be sure, Cupid is also shown with \u201ctwo masks at his feet.\u201d Since, as Georgievska-Shine argues, the masks are meant to symbolize deception, it is \u201cas if the artist wanted to make sure the beholder will understand his message\u201d as one of true devotional love. Yet we cannot be sure, if only because of the love god\u2019s concealed left hand. (Although Georgievska-Shine then develops the further argument that the allusion to Gyges\u2019 ring may signify \u201cthe deceptiveness of images,\u201d such as Vermeer\u2019s painting itself, and at the same time point to us beholders as \u201cinvisible,\u201d \u201cclandestine\u201d Gyges-like figures gazing lovingly at the \u201cbeautiful illusion [of a woman] that the painter has created for us.\u201d)",
      "In Allegory of the Catholic Faith, the overarching theme of which is divine love, we see foregrounded on the left a tapestry curtain with all kinds of \u201clargely illegible forms,\u201d which Georgievska-Shine describes as a \u201cwoven \u2018text\u2019 that simultaneously uncovers and obscures the larger image.\u201d One of those \u201cforms\u201d is an image, largely obscured by the curtain\u2019s folds, of a \u201crider on horseback.\u201d Owing to the allegorical nature of the painting, one can safely infer that the rider is St. Paul and that the curtain is thus \u201chinting at the Pauline obscurity of vision\u201d spoken of in 1 Corinthians 13:12 (\u201cFor now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully understood\u201d).\u00a0",
      "Allegory of the Catholic Faith",
      "Georgievska-Shine wonders whether the image is a \u201cmetaphor for a spiritual journey.\u201d Upon further analysis of the painting\u2019s symbolism, the spiritual journey proves, in her view, to be that of Catholics residing in a country where Calvinism is the established religion, who must gather together for prayer and worship in \u201csecret\u201d places. The presence of hidden meanings in Allegory symbolized by the curtain is confirmed by, among other things, the glass orb hanging from the ceiling, to which the gaze of the central figure\u2014whom Georgievska-Shine describes as a fusion of Mary and Mary Magdalene and christens \u201cFaith\u201d\u2014is directed: Barely visible on the orb is a reflection of a \u201cpartially open window, possibly another signal of the veiled nature of knowledge.\u201d The \u201creflective surface\u201d of the orb, Georgievska-Shine goes on to argue, can be understood to signify, in a veiled, metaphorical way, the painting in its entirety \u201cas a Pauline mirror that guides us from the visible towards that which defies understanding: the metaphysics of love.\u201d",
      "Allegory",
      "One may again come away from a first encounter with Vermeer's paintings thinking that in them form ministers to a purely naturalistic artistic aim: Formal elements of art such as line, color, texture, and shading are used to make the contents of the painting resemble, with near-photographic accuracy, things as we experience them in everyday life. However, as Georgievska-Shine points out, attentive observation discloses a strong \"classicizing\" tendency continuous with that of the Renaissance. The near-geometrical organization of the contents of his paintings along clearly recognizable vertical and horizontal lines, one of those classicizing features, prefigure the geometrical abstractions of twentieth-century Dutch modernist Piet Mondrian, for instance, his Broadway Boogie Woogie. But in Vermeer's case, classical form and order are made to serve the visual expression of higher human meanings, such as man's love of God, that cohere with a Christianity touched by neoplatonic philosophy. His artwork shows how the beauty of classical form and harmony can \u201caffect our soul\u201d in an edifying way.",
      "Broadway Boogie Woogie",
      "From detailed discussions and analyses like these, the reader can begin to perceive how the paintings relate to each other to form a coherent whole. The clear implication of the book is that Vermeer\u2019s \u201cart of love\u201d can be seen as a visually recreated cosmos of love that subtly reflects a cosmology with love as its ruling principle.",
      "Some of Georgievska-Shine\u2019s interpretations may strike the reader as doubtful, unclear, or far-fetched. But so erudite, detailed, and finely honed is her argument that intellectual integrity obliges us to carefully reread the entire book to ensure that such doubts do not stem from misunderstandings on our part.",
      "Georgievska-Shine\u2019s book brings to light love\u2019s many-sidedness and complexity\u2014with stress on its more uplifting aspects\u2014in Vermeer\u2019s rich visual portrayals. Mirroring Vermeer\u2019s artistic intention, which coincides with a more traditional, common-sense perspective on the subject, and contrary to the contemporary taste for debunking, Georgievska-Shine stands firmly on the essential and irreducible distinction between spiritual (or noble) and corporeal (or base) eros."

      "Since World War II, the United States has had a bipartisan policy toward Europe. That policy is based on an imagined trade-off: In return for defending the continent via NATO\u2019s Article V protections, the U.S. gets to act as though Europe\u2014both individual nations and the European Union as a whole\u2014is a vassal state and does more or less whatever America wants.\u00a0",
      "Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has shown that this conception is a fantasy. The reality is that the E.U. mouths support for the U.S. for American defense guarantees while, at the same time, cozying up with America\u2019s rivals, whether Russian or Chinese.",
      "Rather than recognize how outrageous this situation is, successive American presidents have, mostly, refused to demand more from those who demand so much of us. When Europeans have discussed going their own way on defense, they have faced criticism\u2014including from none other than Donald Trump, who suggested that European countries should pay their share of the NATO defense budget before pursuing their own projects.\u00a0",
      "have",
      "Both the Trump and Biden Administrations have been maddeningly unclear on America\u2019s policy toward China, waffling on whether or not China is a serious enemy or just a friend to \u201cout-compete.\u201d Why would the E.U. risk economic storms to break up with a country that America couldn\u2019t even say was an enemy\u2014while knowing that there was no way America would ever abandon them?\u00a0\u00a0",
      "America\u2019s policy for Europe may have worked in the midst of the Cold War, but it is delusional to think that it would work in the 21st century, when the primary threat is on the other side of Eurasia\u2014and both parties have continued on with the delusion. Fortunately, with elements of foreign policy realism being embraced by both GOP frontrunners, there now exists a chance for conservatives to find a new way forward.",
      "During the Cold War, American policy was straightforward regarding Europe: keep it free of governmental anti-Americanism. The practical upshot of this goal was keeping the Russians out and the Germans down. The Europeans were happy to add \u201c\u2026and the Americans in\u201d to that formulation, and voila: the rationale for NATO came into existence.\u00a0",
      "Now there is no ideology that can convert Europe into an anti-American satellite\u2014and there are easier (and cheaper) ways to keep Europe free of anti-Americanism than what we're doing now. America can do this by taking advantage of the European fault-lines, centuries old, which have re-opened after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Over the course of the invasion, an old quasi-alliance has quietly returned: that of France and Poland. This friendship has appeared off and on throughout history; Napoleon resurrected a Polish state, and during the 1930s and World War II the two nations were closely aligned. It is driven, as are all international relations, by power politics. France has long aspired to have political control over Europe and gain supremacy over Germany; Poland aspires to keep existing despite the historic threats of Germany and Russia. The latest iteration, though less obvious than in the past (due partially to Poland\u2019s semi-pariah status in the E.U. as a result of its conservatism), has seen France and Poland unofficially team up to embarrass Germany into sending tanks to Ukraine.\u00a0",
      "Post-war America has traditionally supported Germany over France. Former Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2014whose terrible foreign policy incumbent Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been unlucky enough to inherit, though he has not made his own job any easier with his inconsistent stance\u2014was close with both George W. Bush and Barack Obama. From the perspective of keeping the E.U. as a vassal, this made sense on paper: Despite its enormous economic power, post-war Germany clearly telegraphed that it had no desire to march across Europe once again and was generally well-liked by the rest of the continent. By supporting the power that had no desire to turn the E.U. into something more, America kept Europe down and docile.",
      "Things have changed. Germany\u2019s position in post-war Europe has never been weaker. Scholz\u2019s polling numbers among the German public are poor, and, with regard to the wider E.U., Germany\u2019s waffling on the Russo-Ukrainian War has pleased no one and aggravated everyone. This is France and Poland\u2019s moment to strike while the iron is hot.",
      "It is also the prime moment for America to change horses. Germany is not doing whatever America wants, nor are they really staying down. Just years ago, they declared it \u201cunacceptable\u201d for America to consider moving its own troops\u2014troops that were defending them from Russia, a country they were happy to do deals with over American protests. They also recently announced stronger economic ties with China and affirmed no decoupling would take place. (When France balks at decoupling from China, it at least lacks hypocrisy\u2014the nation has been ambivalent or hostile to American defense since de Gaulle.) In short, Germany is unpopular, weak, and uncooperative.",
      "What would revamping America\u2019s policy toward Europe look like? One possibility is fostering the France-Poland alignment within a stronger E.U. framework. America\u2019s instinctual hatred of any form of an independent E.U. military force should be jettisoned; we should instead embrace the concept. A pan-European army might be a long way off, but with France and Poland pushing the E.U. to take care of itself\u2014and Poland clearly desiring a strong military of its own\u2014we should allow them to plant the seeds. This does our work for us at a fraction of the cost and commitment. A more militarized Franco-Polish-led E.U. means a more centralized E.U. The more centralized the E.U., the less China\u2019s influence over single states will matter.",
      "If America were to support this shift, it would bolster its popularity across eastern Europe; former Soviet-orbit states would jump at the chance to join a serious continental army, which would allow them to defend themselves independent of great-power neighbors. The E.U. has about 400 million people, nuclear weapons, and a GDP close to that of the U.S.; there is no reason why a militarized E.U. could not handle Russia without the U.S. American support for a robust, independent E.U. bloc means such an alliance would never be definitively pro-China, keeping anti-Americanism out of that end of Eurasia and allowing the U.S. to move its strategic focus to the Pacific.",
      "This would be a dramatic reconception of American foreign policy. The lack of \u201cwar for democracy\u201d-style arguments may bother the remaining neoconservatives, and a lack of total withdrawal from NATO may bother some paleoconservatives. But realignment demands new thinking. Readjusting our policy toward Europe, with an eye to France and Poland, would be a start."

      "Our country\u2019s powerful immigration lobby has launched a new national campaign called Welcome.US. The initiative is an effort to find sponsors and support for hundreds of thousands, potentially millions, of new migrants. Welcome.US is a massive public pressure effort by the \u201clargest coalition in refugee resettlement history\u201d that also serves to give political cover to the Biden administration\u2019s open-border policies.\u00a0",
      "The Welcome.US approach is a full-court press on all Americans to sign up to sponsor every last refugee the Biden administration deposits on our shores. Sounding as preachy as DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Welcome.US argues that more contact with the coming waves of refugees will do us all good. This campaign is headed by all living former U.S. presidents and First Ladies (except one noteworthy couple), a long list of celebrity policymakers, business, academic, and religious leaders, plus professional advocates and humanitarians, and of course a few Hollywood types (like Cher).\u00a0",
      "The website states:",
      "Resettling our newest neighbors requires a whole-country response. That\u2019s why four former Presidents and four former First Ladies have joined us as leaders of this effort \u2013 above all, to lift up our collective efforts and remind us that this is our opportunity, in a time of too much division, for a common purpose.",
      "So much for former presidents remaining above partisan conflicts. Carter, Clinton, Obama, and Bush are thrusting themselves, under the guise of accommodating refugees, into the scorching controversy of Joe Biden\u2019s immigration and border policies. Any national program for resettling these refugees and migrants must address why they are coming. But typically, as was the case so often during the Bush and Obama years, the Welcome.US coalition seeks to avoid an honest debate on immigration, choosing instead to camouflage the issue behind something else\u2014in this case, refugee support.",
      "Welcome.US is in fact a clever smokescreen. The group\u2019s hullabaloo about taking care of Afghan and Ukrainian refugees belies another intention, which is to draw popular attention away from the Biden administration\u2019s January 5 unlawful decision to open the country to at least 360,000 economic migrants a year from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela\u2014and very likely many more. Biden\u2019s unprecedented executive overreach constitutes a new immigration program that the White House knows Congress would never approve.",
      "There are in fact 20 U.S. states currently challenging Biden\u2019s 360,000-a-year Caribbean-migrant policy in federal court, illustrating again just how controversial the White House decision is. Welcome.US appears to hope that the Caribbean migrants just get lumped in with the more popular support for fleeing Afghans and Ukrainians. It is no surprise that a visitor on the group\u2019s website has to click around\u2014past all the talk about those two nationalities\u2014to find out that sponsors are also sought for Biden\u2019s highly questionable Caribbean-migrant program.",
      "Like the White House, Welcome.US has big immigration plans and no time to wait for federal courts: \u201cWe operate on the evidence that direct participation with newcomers transforms both the welcomer and those being welcomed. Our ultimate ambition is for every American community \u2013 and the nation as a whole \u2013 to have the resources and willingness to welcome newcomers, now and in the future.\u201d\u00a0Apparently, there is a lot of transformational work to do on the yokels.",
      "There can be, of course, an honest debate about how many legitimate refugees from Afghanistan and Ukraine the United States should accept, but that discussion has nothing to do with Secretary Mayorkas\u2019s scheme to open America\u2019s frontiers to massive numbers from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The administration does not want to work within Congressionally approved refugee resettlement procedures and quotas, as if following the law was an option, and the advocates of Welcome.US have enthusiastically signed on to the White House\u2019s questionable approach.",
      "Consider that the administration originally agreed to a maximum of 125,000 refugee spots in fiscal year 2022\u2014and then only filled 25,000 places. Instead, Biden and Mayorkas essentially threw out the authorized refugee process, which they considered too slow and too limiting, to invent their own speedy but unlawful \u201cnew paths\u201d that simply deem selected foreign nationalities as refugees and admit them. Therefore, almost all of Biden-Mayorkas migrants that Welcome.US is sponsoring do not even meet the U.S. government legal definition of \u201crefugee.\u201d",
      "The existing system was designed to create a manageable process that is supported by a domestic political consensus and an internal resettlement capacity. It also requires that individual refugees and their family members be interviewed and vetted outside the United States. That is admittedly a tedious, time-consuming procedure, but it is rightly designed to screen people before actually admitting them into the country.",
      "outside",
      "The more refugees, the more federal resources that flow to Welcome.US. It is an old Washington con-game for foundations and service organizations to lecture the rest of us on their commitments to advance the public good, while they derive profits and power for their efforts. Exactly in this spirit, Welcome.US is replete with advocacy groups and activists who for years have lobbied for expansive immigration in a way that also nicely serves their narrow financial self-interest.\u00a0",
      ".",
      "Thus, embedded in the broad Welcome coalition is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, and the National Restaurants Association, along with other commercial interests such as large employers Walmart and Microsoft, all eager for new tranches of cheap laborers. These businesses are laser-focused on their profits and just fine with passing the inevitable disruptions in community social services, schools, and housing onto the backs of ordinary citizens. The Welcome.US coalition likewise consists of numerous refugee resettlement agencies and their affiliates such as the United Way and Goodwill, all theoretically non-profit, but destined to be lavished by the Biden administration with hundreds of millions in new federal grants.",
      "Welcome.US is already hiring staff and is ready to dispense its own grant money as it prepares for a long campaign. In fact, this campaign represents the full force of the country\u2019s mighty Immigration-Industrial Complex, mobilized and deployed, on a mission not only to win more migrants, but to defend against a coming policy counterattack, because it correctly fears the Biden-Mayorkas overreach is actually vulnerable to a great political rebuke. \u00a0\u00a0",
      "Welcome.US has also already deployed lawyers in depth, starting with the American Bar Association, whose concern for due process and rule of law apparently does not cover the Biden administration\u2019s shenanigans in legalizing faux refugees. But the ABA leadership is no doubt already preparing constitutional attacks against any post-Biden, conservative administration that might want to return those migrants whose genuine identities prove to be other than what they claim. If only middle-class Americans had such advocacy firepower working on their behalf.\u00a0",
      "Welcome.US planners have also recruited faith leaders, signing on numerous main-line church representatives. But compassion needs to be smart and aware: Very few, if any, of these national church leaders are voicing any disapproval or condemnation of President Biden\u2019s policies that lure desperate migrants to America\u2019s frontiers, resulting along the way in countless smuggling deaths and the exploitation of women and children through human trafficking.\u00a0",
      "To be fair, objective observers must acknowledge that some participants in the Welcome.US coalition are genuinely only motivated by the plight of refugees. But that fact does nothing to diminish the reality of the political chess game that Welcome.US is playing at the behest of the White House to advance policies opposed by a majority of Americans. \u00a0",
      "The foreign-born population in the U.S. is approaching 50 million people, and Americans rightly believe they already shoulder their fair share of international charity without being preached to by the country\u2019s elites. Despite the best misdirection efforts of Welcome.US, this debate is about much more than America\u2019s generosity toward refugees; it is fundamentally about defending the rule of law against a reckless administration."

It's not that everything Orban or Bukele does is justified or suited for the United States.

As I explain in Live Not By Lies, we have been dealing in this country with a fundamentally totalitarian ideology, one that has taken over stealthily by disguising itself as therapeutic help for victims of society's past bigotries. Wokeness is deeply enmeshed in the institutional structures and cultures of the United States.

Viktor Orban does that in Hungarian. Americans don't see or hear it, and have to depend on what the US liberal media say about Orban (e.g., the Washington Post the other day referred to him in a news story as \"repressive,\" even though Hungary is far more liberal than many other countries, whose leaders would never be described that way in a news story in the Post). This is why so many Americans assume that Orban keeps getting re-elected because he has strongarmed the Hungarian media. Nope. There is a robust free media culture here, and the leading media outlets are all anti-Orban. He keeps getting re-elected because people like his policies, and because he advocates for them clearly and articulately. During the election campaign last year, I talked with lots of people, all over this liberal city (Budapest), asking them about their voting intentions. After hearing their particular gripes about Orban, I would almost always hear, \"... but I'm going to vote for him, because the opposition is just hopelessly bad.\"",
      "One thing too you can say about Orban and Bukele: they don't just talk the talk, but they walk the walk. This is my biggest beef with Trump's presidency: he was mostly talk. He had four years to do more than just talk about the excesses of the Left. When I was in college back in the Eighties, we had a guy in student media who was a big fat comic book nerd. Sweet kid, from down the bayou. Once he said, in his thick Cajun accent, \"Batman ain't no real super hero. He a costume hero. He don't change nothin'; he just beats up people who rob gas stations.\" That's how I feel about the difference between Trump and DeSantis.",

These Republicans like Pence, Pompeo, and Hogan, who fall back on the \"I'm a small-government conservative\" excuse to justify their lack of vision and courage, disqualify themselves, in my view.

      "This stubborn fact of biological reality\u2014including aging and death\u2014presents human beings with a choice: \"accepting a reality we cannot alter or denying that reality even exists.\"",
      "In a sense, the fact that this choice is available to humans is definitive of our humanity: No other animal even has the capacity to contemplate rejecting their nature\u2014it is simply imposed upon them.\u00a0Humans alone have the freedom to defy their nature.\u00a0And yet, virtually all wisdom traditions, from Christianity, to Stoicism, to Buddhism, point out that true freedom is found in the recognition of limits and striving to live according to the givenness of our nature.\u00a0To be fully human is to understand that humans are limited.",
      "In our technological age, which equates knowledge and power and seeks to overcome all limits, \u201c[the] simple, commonplace observation people weaken with age points to a power that will forever remain beyond human authority, which is the power to control time.\u201d Therefore, it must be denied or suppressed through technology or medical science.",
      "people weaken with age",
      "But the fact remains that no matter how rich we are, no matter how many technological enhancements we buy to try to slow or cover it\u2014botox, hairplugs, plastic surgery\u2014\u201cin the end we degrade anyway because we are not God.\u201d\u00a0",
      "we are not God",
      "In the Christian tradition, pride is the deadliest of sins because it is the root of all other sin.\u00a0It is the original sin of Satan, who set himself up against God, and it is the sin of Adam and Eve who believed the serpent in the garden when he told them ye shall be as God.",
      "ye shall be as God",
      "To counteract this temptation, we have to accept the limits of creatureliness and created nature.\u00a0And, as it happens, this is also the key to happiness, sanity, and true liberty.\u00a0As Carlson points out: \u201cAccepting this fact\u2014that we are not God\u2014working within the pre-ordained limits of nature is the key to balance and happiness in this human life. Ignoring that fact leads to insanity.\u201d",
      "A conservative disposition begins with a recognition of the contingency of all things, and a gratitude for what has been received.\u00a0As Carlson points out, echoing St. Paul: \u201cyou don\u2019t manufacture a [sunny day], you receive it.\u201d",
      "The sickness of our culture is typified in the way that \u201cour leadership class is at open war with nature. Nature is the final limit to their power, and so they hate it.\u201d\u00a0",
      "Despite the apparent deference to nature in the popularization of climate activism or organic foods, at the deepest level our cultural elites reject nature as normative in any sense. Natural law and natural right are rejected in favor of a morality that recognizes as normative only the projection of power and the overcoming of limits.",
      "But this is, of course, ridiculous, and made even more so by the glaring failures of leadership that seem to be growing more prevalent all the time\u2014from power grid failures in California to failed wars aimed at spreading democracy.\u00a0",
      "These cracks in the fa\u00e7ade, Tucker contends, cause our elites to insist ever more vehemently on their power and become unhinged when their weaknesses are pointed out: At some level, \u201cthey know how limited they are which is why they become so hysterical in the face of physical reality: because it\u2019s a reminder of their limits.\u201d\u00a0",
      "In order to regain our sanity\u2014to say nothing of restoring our constitutional order\u2014our culture must learn to embrace the limits of our nature.\u00a0\u201cWise leaders recognize the limits\u2014the inherent limits\u2014of their power.\u201d\u00a0The same can be said for wise citizens.\u00a0",
      "While we should always strive to act in ways that better ourselves and our societies, any political program that promises to definitively overcome the limits of the human condition should be viewed with suspicion.\u00a0As Carlson concludes, when you deny reality \u201cbad things happen.

John Brown\u2019s raid on the federal armory at Harper\u2019s Ferry the previous fall and the fiery rhetoric of Northern abolitionists stoked fears of a slave rebellion among the highly literate local population. In the Sulfur River breaks to the northeast, tensions brewed between Unionist and pro-secession smallholders and would soon turn murderous. North Texas newspapers urged vigilance against seditionists determined to lead slaves in insurrection.",
      "Before the remains of the town had cooled, Charles Pryor, a slaveholder and editor of the Dallas Herald, wrote that abolitionists had fomented a \u201cdeep-laid scheme of villainy\u201d to terrorize North Texas. After interrogating dozens of slaves, Dallas\u2019s vigilance committee charged three alleged ringleaders. On July 23, after a closed-door meeting, city leaders sentenced the accused men to death and every other adult slave in the county to disciplinary beating. The next afternoon, the three were hanged on the bank of the Trinity River.\u00a0",

      "Beyond the violence of the lynching, the most unsettling aspect of the account is that the men who ordered the murder were not psychopaths. Were they born in the 1980s instead of 1810-20, their personalities and sensibilities would almost certainly fit the statistical profile of people of similar station today, regardless of race.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "Likely, Dallas\u2019s vigilance committee, made up of members of its professional class, prominent merchants and farmers, and other business people, worried more about the excitable, potentially violent elements in the community than any \u201cdeep-laid scheme of villainy.\u201d They had a situation on their hands. These educated men, whatever their positions on slavery, could look at the evidence: A town square built of wood; a 109-degree day; fires used for blacksmithing, cooking, and steam generation; prevalence of cigar smoking among men; the highly unstable phosphorus matches in common use; confessions extracted by torture. Indeed, two prominent jurists respected for their fairness and generosity threw up their hands after their objections were ignored.\u00a0",
      "The fire and the accused symbolized the fears and resentments of people barely removed from the western frontier and on the verge of war, who knew of and resented what had been said and written about their culture in the free states. The innocence or guilt of the accused mattered little to them. Something had to be done. A message had to be sent, both as a warning and as vindication. \u201cYou see? These men have confessed. This is why these people cannot be let loose among us. You outsiders cannot understand and have no business passing judgement. We will handle matters in our own way.\u201d\u00a0",

In The Legacy of the Civil War, Robert Penn Warren wrote, \u201c[Before] 1861, the only function then left open to intellect in the South was apologetics for the closed society, not criticism of it \u2026 The philosophy of the Southern apologist did, however, offer space in its finely wrought interstices for the bravado, arrogance, paranoid suspiciousness, and the reckless or ignorant disregard for consequences that marked the Southern \u2018fire-eater.\u2019\u201d",

I had misgivings about looking through the images, but I felt a duty to absorb as far as possible the horror I planned to write about. I thought I knew what I was getting into\u2014I had seen old lynching photos here and there\u2014but there is no preparing for the images and descriptions of burnings, hangings, dismemberment, castration, mutilation, torture, page after page, from light poles, tree limbs, bridges, some with crowds looking on. All but a few of the victims were black. Anyone but a sociopath will struggle with these images long after even one viewing.\u00a0",
      "Without Sanctuary",
      "Without Sanctuary opens with a short foreword by civil rights hero and Georgia congressman John Lewis, who recalls that as a boy growing up in rural Alabama, he could hardly believe his elders\u2019 stories of nightriders and racial terror. \u201cWhat is it in the human psyche that would drive a person to commit such violence against their fellow citizens?\u201d He closes with a call to prevent \u201canything like this from ever happening again.\u201d",
      "Without Sanctuary",
      "Historian Leon Litwack follows with \u201cHell Hounds,\u201d an essay that places the photographs in context. He mentions accounts of spectators fighting over \u201csouvenirs\u201d\u2014fingers, ears, pieces of internal organs. Newspapers of the day either defended the lynch mobs outright or justified the lawlessness as necessary for public safety. Professor Litwack writes that in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, two or three black Southerners were hanged, burned at the stake or quietly murdered every week. \u201cBetween 1882 and 1968, an estimated 4,742 blacks met their deaths at the hands of lynch mobs. As many if not more blacks were victims of legal lynchings (speedy trials and executions), private white violence\u2026murdered by a variety of means in isolated rural sections\u2026\u201d The latter claim is no less plausible for being unprovable.\u00a0",
      "Litwack further notes that lynching had long served as a means of extralegal justice in the Far West and Midwest, and that most of those victims had been white, but that from 1890 onward the practice became almost exclusive to the South, with black Americans as victims. (Tuskegee University estimates that between 1882 and 1968, 3,446 black and 1,297 white people were lynched in the United States.) There were dissenters. Litwack quotes the mayor of Statesboro, Georgia: \u201cIf our grand juries won\u2019t indict these lynchers, if our petit juries won\u2019t convict, and if our soldiers won\u2019t shoot, what are we coming to?\u201d Litwack further notes, \u201cTownspeople closed ranks to protect their own kind\u2026eyewitnesses refused to testify\u2026\u201d",
      "Hilton Als, a staff writer for the New Yorker, follows Litwack\u2019s essay with several pages of stylish narcissism in which he refers to the \u201cflashbulb smiles\u201d of white lynchers. I see not flashbulb smiles but self-conscious defiance of people who, like the Dallas mob decades before, cannot imagine a radically different order under which their great-grandchildren might view these photographs with revulsion and incomprehension. Robert Penn Warren also described this toxic insularity in The Legacy of the Civil War: \u201cIn defeat, the Solid South was born \u2013 not only the witless automation of fidelity to the Democratic Party, but the mystique of prideful difference, identity, and defensiveness \u2026 in the moment of death, the Confederacy entered upon its immortality.\u201d\u00a0",
      "New Yorker",
      "The Legacy of the Civil War",
      "The likelihood that some of the victims were guilty of serious crimes detracts nothing from the photographs. The lynched were denied their rights as citizens. Law enforcement and criminal justice in the long-settled South faced none of the exigencies common to frontier people dealing with dangerous criminals. Yet the violent order persisted, in part, because most people who opposed it simply looked the other way rather than face entrenched local power backed by vindictive rabble.\u00a0",
      "Initially, the meaning of the title Without Sanctuary seemed obvious: In the Jim Crow South, the rule of law provided black Americans no sanctuary against racial terror. As I forced myself through the book, a second, subtler meaning came to me: The photographs stand as an indictment against which white Americans, especially those with roots in the South, can find no sanctuary. This history must be faced out in the open, not in perpetual guilt, which devolves into blood libel, but in honesty and with full understanding of lingering effects and the murderous irrationality into which ordinary people can descend when freed from consequences.\u00a0",
      "Without Sanctuary",
      "In The True and Only Heaven: Progress and its Critics, historian Christopher Lasch attributes much of the civil rights movement\u2019s success in the South in the early 1960s to the ability of Martin Luther King Jr. and his followers to \u201c[expose] the moral claims of the white supremacist regime in the South to the most damaging scrutiny\u2026\u201d King accomplished this, according to Lasch, by addressing white oppressors \u201cnot only as fellow sinners but also as fellow Southerners\u2026\u201d and by reminding his followers not to allow their suffering to serve as an excuse for dysfunction. Furthermore, per Lasch, the black leadership was respectably middle class, a reality not lost on moderate white clergy who became \u201ctortured souls\u201d when faced with the demand that they live up to their professed ideas.",
      "The True and Only Heaven: Progress and its Critics",
      "Nor could white Southerners escape the judgement of a nation appalled by images of fire hoses and dogs turned on protestors or images of black school children escorted through baying mobs of whites who could not imagine that a decade on no American student would get through middle school without an opportunity to consider those faces contorted by anger and hate. They were aggrieved and sure in their justification by what Warren called \u201cThe Great Alibi.\u201d Again, from The Legacy of the Civil War:\u00a0",
      "The Legacy of the Civil War",
      "By the Great Alibi, pellagra, hookworm, and illiteracy are all explained away\u2026 Laziness becomes the aesthetic sense, blood-lust rising from a matrix of boredom and resentful misery becomes a sense of honor and ignorance becomes divine revelation.",
      "The race problem, according to the Great Alibi, is the doom defined by history\u2014by New England slavers, New England and Middlewestern Abolitionists, cotton, climate, the Civil War, Reconstruction, Wall Street, the Jews.",
      "For more than half a century after the end of Reconstruction, Southern apologists guarded and curated their region\u2019s history with remarkable success rather than directly confront the malignancy of racial violence. Eventually, denial became impossible in light of evidence. Legislation backed by threat of force ended the most egregious forms. But true changes in the hearts of Southerners began with \u201ctortured souls,\u201d stigma, and relentless, merciless cultural pressure from which there was no sanctuary.\u00a0",
      "In August 2022, The Caucus of African American Leaders, based in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, announced the creation of the Emmett Till Alert System. Modeled after the nationwide Amber Alert, the new system will notify black leaders and clergy about possible hate crimes. The 1955 murder of fourteen-year-old Emmitt Till cut a deep wound in the American psyche, a gash now constantly freshened by news media and Hollywood. A hate crime alert system could not be better named. Meanwhile, some twenty-three miles north of the Caucus\u2019s headquarters, Baltimore has suffered some 2,000 homicides over the past six years.",

In January, the U.S. State Department\u2019s Overseas Security Advisory Council held a meeting, which was leaked to journalists in an audio recording, to discuss the need to prepare for a total collapse of South Africa\u2019s power grid.\u00a0",

Resistance to his efforts at the highest levels, including by cabinet politicians, made his job impossible, and \u201cload shedding\u201d (as the rolling blackouts are called) reached record levels in 2021. With nothing left to lose, last month De Ruyter gave an hour-long interview to journalist Annika Larsen where he spilled the whole sorry story of corruption at Eskom.",

More disturbing than the assassination attempt was the total lack of interest in investigating it on the part of law enforcement. One of the workmen repairing the broken coffee machine on the day of the poisoning \u201chas since absconded from work, he\u2019s disappeared,\u201d according to De Ruyter. \u201cThat remains to be investigated.\u201d The detectives who took De Ruyter\u2019s statement \u201cinquired whether I had been experiencing problems with my sinuses.

The dominos that would fall in the case of a total grid collapse start with phone lines, internet, and traffic lights, and end with looting, crime, and civil unrest.",
      "So electricity could be the pillar that finally brings the Rainbow Nation tumbling to the ground. Why Eskom? Because it sits at the intersection of the three themes of South Africa\u2019s long decline: politics, incompetence, and crime.",
      "Politics is what prevented Eskom from raising rates throughout the late 1990s and mid-2000s, when it badly needed revenue in order to build new power stations and replace old ones. Cheap electricity was seen as a perk of post-apartheid freedom, and hikes were avoided at all costs out of fear of public backlash. The result was that Eskom\u2019s generation capacity deteriorated to the point of crisis, and efforts to repair the damage were too little, too late.",
      "Many South Africans simply refuse to pay their electricity bills, which is also a political problem. There is no way the ruling party would permit Eskom to cut off the vast majority of Soweto residents (around 80 percent) who don\u2019t pay. Eskom therefore finds it impossible to collect the tens of billions of rand it is owed by delinquent customers. Even when it does attempt to cut off deadbeats, vandalism and illegal hookups render such measures futile. Any serious crackdown by Eskom on this rampant theft would doubtless be met with violence.",
      "This would be a challenge even for the best managers, but Eskom\u2019s managers are not the best. As a parastatal, Eskom is subject to aggressive diversity targets under Black Economic Empowerment laws. In 1995, its senior management was mandated to go from 70 percent white to 50 percent black by 1999 and 75 percent black by 2005. In 2008, Eskom\u2019s head of human resources announced, \u201cOver the next five years...Eskom has to appoint two new staff every day, and it is adamant that one of them will be a black woman.\u201d",
      "These targets were replicated across all sectors of the South African economy, and everywhere they have had the same effect: incompetence. Anthea Jeffery\u2019s Bee: Helping or Hurting? documents multiple instances where people died because hospital administrators or water inspectors hired due to affirmative action were not qualified for their jobs. R.W. Johnson, the international press\u2019s most widely read writer on South African affairs, has only one leg today because in 2009 he injured his foot swimming in a lagoon that proved to be polluted and the resulting infection required an amputation\u2014just one more casualty of incompetence at the Department of Water Affairs.",
      "Bee: Helping or Hurting?",
      " ",
      "The electricity business involves bigger sums of money than water management, which is where the third factor in Eskom\u2019s fall comes in: crime. Eskom has been a target of mafia syndicates in a way that other utilities have not, because of the black market value of the commodities it handles, notably coal but also wires and equipment. South African journalist Kyle Cowan investigated several failures at Eskom facilities, such as downed pylons and jammed coal mills, and discovered many cases where sabotage was the likely cause. Never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence\u2014but, as the assassination attempt against De Ruyter shows, both are certainly at play here. Plant managers at Eskom facilities need bulletproof vests and armed bodyguards to walk around their own facilities.",
      "The fundamental problem that makes Eskom\u2019s situation so intractable, as De Ruyter said in his interview, is that \u201cyou can\u2019t post a policeman over every employee\u2019s shoulder to watch what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Sabotage and theft are often invisible. The effort needed to turn around such a widespread problem would be massive, requiring support not only from management at all levels but from law enforcement, politicians, and bureaucrats. That is why it is unlikely to happen. De Ruyter eventually concluded as much, which is why he is heading off for a well-deserved vacation\u2014somewhere out of the country, he says, beyond the reach of assassins. \u201cI think it will be good for my health.\u201d"

I think it would be immoral for one thing, but more basically, it has zero chance of success in the world today, for the reasons MWD points out. But he could have gone even further. The integralist Catholics today would have to convince even their fellow Catholics to surrender their liberties to be governed by an illiberal order that privileges the Catholic Church, and renders non-Catholics second class citizens. I'm sure it looks good on paper to a few people, but most Catholics in the West, and certainly everybody else, would strongly, even violently, resist. The only way it could succeed is through tyranny. If you aren't going to resort to tyranny -- imagine Adrian Vermeule with Xi Jinping's surveillance state apparatus! -- then you end up back at evangelism and persuasion. Which is where we should be for both moral and practical reasons -- practical, because in a post-Christian world -- that is, a world that has already been through Christianization, and has fallen away from it -- you are not going to be able to compel people to accept Christian belief. How likely do you think Western peoples today would be willing to accept Islam if it were forced on them? ",

      "But let's say it worked, and somehow we got an Integralist state, for the same reason France in Houellebecq's Submission turned to political Islam: out of sheer exhaustion and demoralization. Does that save souls? Does it make lives more Christlike? I mean, look, I'm Orthodox, and I can't exactly regret Prince Vladimir forcibly Christianizing the people of Kievan Rus. If not for the Christian princes, brutal as they may have been, acting that way -- consistent with morals and practices of the distant past -- many of us heirs to a more gentle Christianity might not be Christian today. But that doesn't mean that we should want to return to that kind of thing. Not sure how excited any of us should be by a Christian form of ISIS.",

      "The men of America are struggling. As Daniel de Vis\u00e9, a writer for The Hill, recently noted, more than 60 percent of the country\u2019s young men are single, \u201cnearly twice the rate of unattached young women.\u201d He warned that we are now witnessing a complete \u201cbreakdown in the social, romantic, and sexual life of the American male.\u201d\u00a0",
      "The Hill",
      "Only an idiot would disagree with this point. In the U.S., males are responsible for 80% of suicides, according to the CDC. Every 13.7 minutes, somewhere in America, a man takes his own life. Millions of men are desperate, loveless, aimless souls. Which raises the question: What can be done? Maybe more desperate men should seek psychological assistance? On second thoughts, maybe they shouldn't.",
      "That\u2019s because, like the country\u2019s men, psychology is also struggling. In its current state, it is ill-equipped to help the men of America\u2014or anyone for that matter.\u00a0Over the last few years, it has become fashionable for more and more people in the psychology community to reject evolutionary psychology, a direct descendent of psychology and biology. As Satoshi Kanazawa, an expert in evolutionary psychology at London School of Economics, told me, \u201cevolutionary psychology is based on evolutionary biology, dealing with genes and cells, which are smaller than humans and other animals.\u201d\u00a0",
      "\u201cEvolutionary psychology and its causal mechanisms,\u201d he said, \u201care more fundamental than other branches of psychology and their causal explanations, which mostly deal with whole human beings.\u201d To reject evolutionary psychology is to reject broader reality; an outright rejection of biological and evolved realities is occurring.\u00a0",
      "Doubters should check out\u00a0some of the American Psychological Association\u2019s (APA) more recent statements, like this one claiming that there are no major differences between men and women\u2014in other words, they are claiming that men and women are basically the same, and clinical practice need not reflect any inherent differences between them. The APA, for the uninitiated, is the primary programmatic accreditor for professional education and training in psychology. When it comes to training psychologists and treating Americans, the APA calls all the shots.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "The problem: Men and women are not the same. Sex differences in brain anatomy most definitely exist. The male brain is 10 percent larger than the female brain. Anatomical differences are largely explained by effects of sex hormones on brain development. Males and females experience various emotions\u2014like happiness and sadness, for example\u2014very differently. The APA, which now considers traditionally masculine qualities such as stoicism and competitiveness to be \u201cpsychologically harmful,\u201d is failing men.",

This, of course, is a load of nonsense. There are toxic people, for sure. But masculinity - the qualities associated with being a man - is not in itself \u201ctoxic.\u201d The articles claiming otherwise, however, most definitely are.",
      "Rollo Tomassi, a podcaster and writer who has been discussing the crisis of masculinity for years, told me that psychology is failing men because \u201cmodern psychology is by women for women.\u201d\u00a0",
      "\u201cAcross all fields,\u201d he noted, \u201cfemale doctoral students in psychology outnumber males by approximately three to one and have done so for over a decade.\u201d He\u2019s right.",
      "To compound matters, Tomassi added, \u201cthe few notable men remaining in the field have pivoted away from the work that made them reputable. They now embrace a female-friendly bastardization of their prior works to avoid cancellation and losing tenure or struggle for relevance in an age where online self-help influencers replace them daily.\u201d",
      "Tomassi, who recently appeared on Dr. Phil to discuss the state of masculinity in America, said, \u201cSince the start of the Sexual Revolution, we\u2019ve told men to \u2018man down\u2019; yet modern psychology\u2019s prescription for men is to \u2018man up,\u2019 but only insofar as it benefits women\u2019s interests.\u201d All proposed male solutions are, in fact, \u201cgender-swapped female solutions.\u201d\u00a0",
      "Dr. Phil",
      "\u201cThere cannot be a uniquely male solution, \" he concluded, \u201clargely because to do so would mean acknowledging fundamental differences in men\u2019s evolved psychologies.\u201d And we can\u2019t have that, can we?",
      "To make matters worse, even if a man in need is to go looking for psychological assistance, he'll likely find himself struggling to find an appropriate therapist.\u00a0Men prefer to be counseled by other men, but the field of psychology, as Tomassi pointed out,\u00a0 is currently dominated by females. Receiving therapy from a professional who matches one\u2019s sex is a significant predictor of satisfaction and therapeutic success. Sadly, the U.S. has a severe shortage of suitably qualified male therapists; and the current batch of male therapists being trained, the supposed healers of tomorrow, are busy gulping down APA-approved narratives.\u00a0",
      "The future for American men looks bleak, and it will remain bleak until the APA acknowledges the fact that fundamental differences between men and women exist. Don\u2019t hold your breath."

      "Rural hospitals are shutting down their maternity units, the New York Times reported Sunday. Nearly 100 hospitals, mostly in poorer areas of the country, stopped offering maternal care between 2015 and 2019, with at least one third of all rural hospitals reporting in 2020 that they did not provide obstetrics services. Apparently, these hospitals just can\u2019t afford to keep the 24-hour units staffed\u2014certainly not with the price of labor these days.\u00a0",
      "New York Times",
      "But budgets never tell the whole story. In this case, they are barely the first chapter in a long book, one which tells of the multitude of ways in which birth has been devalued over the last several decades.",
      "Maternity units in rural regions are too expensive in part because Medicaid pays hospitals significantly less per birth than does private insurance\u2014a fresh tally mark for all those who said federalizing healthcare would lead to worse care. The Times reporter names the average price hospitals are paid for a birth by Medicaid in Washington State: a pitiful $6,344 per birth, while private insurance pays an average of $18,193, a threefold increase. The spread is similarly dismal across the country, with an average price disparity of nearly $9,000 between private insurance and Medicaid reimbursements. At least 42 percent of all pregnant women in the United States in 2020 were covered by Medicaid at the time of their birth.",
      "Times ",
      "In wealthier areas, the private insurance payouts often balance the books. Not so much in rural areas, where, coincidentally, a growing plurality of pregnant women are to be found. In 2021, the largest demographic of pregnant women were those below the poverty line, accounting for 40 percent of all U.S. births. Those who are getting pregnant these days are often poor and without private insurance, meaning even an increase in birth rates may not necessarily mean the return of rural maternity units, assuming no significant change in Medicaid prices.",
      "But even taking Medicaid out of the picture entirely wouldn\u2019t necessarily solve the problem. Private insurance outpays Medicaid by the thousands across the board, whether you\u2019re getting a hip replacement or are on a ventilator for Covid-19, and rural hospitals aren\u2019t shuttering general surgery. There is another cause, then, that harms maternity care specifically: namely, a decline in demand for maternal services overall, especially by those who can pay.",
      "With the rate of U.S. child births hitting a record low in 2018, and improvements since then negligible, is it any wonder the business of being born is not half so profitable as it once was? This is not a new data point, of course. We have seen headlines about declining birth rates for probably a decade now, and the causes are as well known as they are unlikely to change. Abortion on demand (the overturn of Roe last summer doesn\u2019t seem to have made a dent in this yet, but more time will tell), declining intimacy rates, and rising infertility are just my generation\u2019s addition to the litany of social and biological barriers between young couples and a quiverfull of children that began to be erected during the sexual revolution. Without a significant increase in birth rates, we can expect it won\u2019t just be the maternity wings at the hospitals closing; other maternity-adjacent services will disappear, too, for lack of demand.\u00a0",
      "Roe ",
      "If the end of the maternity wing meant the return of women to healthier, less invasive childbirth practices, this would be a good thing. Unfortunately, midwives and birth centers remain in the very small minority of available healthcare, and are often only partly covered by insurance. As bad as Medicaid payments are to hospitals, they are even worse to birthing centers. Instead, history suggests these impoverished and constrained mothers will take recourse another way, one that is easier on paper, but bears eternal consequences.",
      "Women below the poverty line account for a full half of all abortions nationally. That number rises to 75 percent when the criteria is broadened to all low-income women. It is a relevant piece in the puzzle when we consider the reasons women get abortions\u2014the cost of having a child is no small consideration. The loss of maternal care at the local hospital introduces a whole host of financial complications, from the loss of time at work to drive out of town to the next nearest hospital, or the risk of avoidable complications, which bring with them further medical bills and more time off work. It might be just the thing to tip a struggling mother\u2019s decision in the direction of death.",
      "For the hospital managers balancing the bank books, the decision to close a maternity unit might be nothing more than a sad but necessary concession to stay afloat. But for the women and their unborn children, and for our nation\u2019s future, the consequences will be much greater."
