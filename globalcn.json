      " Photo: ICChina has achieved a major and decisive victory in its COVID-19 prevention and control since November 2022, and created a miracle of a populous country in the history of human civilization to successfully walk out of the pandemic, and the country's COVID policy adjustment and optimization helped achieve a stable transition and keep the overall death rate at the lowest level worldwide, Chinese top leadership said on Thursday",
      "\u00a0A meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee presided over by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, on Thursday pointed out that over the past three years, China's epidemic prevention procedure has been extraordinary",
      " The country optimized and adjusted epidemic prevention and control measures in accordance to the circumstance, effectively coordinating epidemic prevention and control with economic and social development",
      "\u00a0China's COVID response helped us successfully avoid the widespread prevalence of more virulent and highly lethal viral strains, effectively protect the safety and health of the public and gain previous time for winning the COVID battle, the meeting said",
      "\u00a0The country's optimized COVID management since November 2022 has realized smooth transition of the anti-epidemic work, with more than 200 million people receiving treatment, 800,000 severe cases been effectively treated, and the COVID death rate has remained at the lowest level in the world",
      "\u00a0The practice proved the CPC's major judgment and policy decision on the COVID fight is completely correct and those measures were powerful which the Chinese public fully recognized and its achievement is huge, according to the meeting",
      "\u00a0Some Chinese experts believe that the declaration also marked that the country has walked out of the pandemic and the epidemic is turning into an endemic",
      " As the most populous country now witnesses its society back to normalcy with economic activities recovering quickly, the prospect for the world to see the pandemic over \"is in sight",
      "\"\u00a0\"After experiencing the infection waves in December and January, the Chinese society is now back to normal and people have walked out of the pandemic status, which is also in line with the public expectation,\" an expert close to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who preferred not to be named, told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "\u00a0It also means that we have started a process where the disease became a common respiratory infection disease that won't trigger extra public attention and people will take it with sense of normalcy, the expert said",
      " \"It marks that we have entered the process of endemic,\" he said",
      "\u00a0Decisive victory\u00a0Chinese health officials and experts said recently that the nationwide COVID-19 situation has generally become stable",
      " Although a new wave of mass infections is unlikely to occur in the coming months, schools and rural areas will be the next priority for epidemic control",
      "In the past three years, in response to the constantly changing situation of the epidemic, China has issued 10 editions of COVID-19 control protocols, and avoided the large-scale spreading of the original strain and Delta strain with strong pathogenicity, reducing deaths and severe illness from COVID-19",
      "\u00a0Compared with three years ago, the pathogenicity of the Omicron strain has significantly weakened",
      " \"We have more knowledge of the virus and more types of antiviral drugs as well as experience in treating COVID-19 with traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine,\" Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist with the China CDC, said at a recent press conference",
      "\u00a0There is only a \"trifling possibility\" that a new wave of COVID-19 epidemic infections will emerge in the coming months in China, as the population's immunity remains at a high level, Wu said",
      "\u00a0\u00a0We have successfully weathered the massive exit wave before the Spring Festival holidays, and despite many feared that the infection could rebound after the festival, it did not, Li Tongzeng, director of the infection department of Beijing Youan Hospital, told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "\u00a0\"We also did not see the emergence of newly and more dangerous variants; also the case of patients with severe symptoms and death cases are declining,\" Li said, noting that the country also acquired a robust hybrid immunity generated by natural infection and vaccination in the past few months, so another outbreak is unlikely to occur in the near future",
      "\u00a0On Wednesday, the China CDC released the latest situation of the COVID infection, saying that the number of in-hospital deaths dropped to 9 on Monday, down 99",
      "8 percent from the peak",
      " Since December 9, 2022, the number of reported positive cases have increased then kept declining",
      " It reached the peak of 6",
      "94 million on December 22 and dropped to 8,847 on Monday",
      "\u00a0Turn into endemic\u00a0Some experts believe that as China has stepped out of the epidemic, treating COVID-19 as endemic, the WHO will likely announce the end of the COVID-19 pandemic as a global health emergency soon",
      "\u00a0While the China CDC is actively monitoring infection situation across the country, the country will be safely prevented from suffering another outbreak of new variants at least in the coming months",
      "Lu Hongzhou, head of the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, told the Global Times on Thursday that another major COVID-19 epidemic is unlikely to occur in China within six months, based on previous studies which has indicated that cellular immunity is still high generally after around six and seven months after infection",
      "Lu believes that the effective vaccination and the timely use of anti-viral medicines would be key factors to prevent severe cases and reduce fatality rate",
      "According to the China CDC, there have been more than 83,000 COVID-19 related deaths in hospitals in the Chinese mainland from December 8 to February 9, but the number of deaths and positive cases has been declining this year",
      "Although the overall epidemic prevention and control situation has been improving, given that the global pandemic is still ongoing, all places and department need to summarize on the three-year experiences and implement epidemic control in the new phase in order to further consolidate the hard-won result, the meeting said",
      "\u00a0The meeting also required to strengthen capacity building for epidemic monitoring and regular early warning, improve the epidemic monitoring system and information reporting system, make timely and accurate early warning while planning the next-phase vaccination work in boosting vaccination rate among the elderly",

      " The two countries entered a new stage of comprehensive development and strategic cooperation in 2005, and established a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2013",
      " By 2016, the pair moved to a comprehensive strategic partnership featuring mutual trust and win-win cooperation, and by 2022, an all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership was established",
      "\u00a0Head-of-state diplomacy plays a decisive role, which will promote the steady and long-term development of bilateral relations and continue to move toward a higher level, Zhao said",

      "Besides being a trip for \"old friends to meet\" and \"deepening cooperation,\" Lukashenko's visit is also a journey of peace, said Zhao Huirong, noting that as a neighbor of Ukraine and Russia, Belarus has been greatly affected by the ongoing conflict, and China's 12-point position paper is in line with Belarus' interests",
      "China and Belarus have further strengthened consensus on the Ukraine crisis through Lukashenko's trip, which is of positive significance for the parties to the conflict to sit down for talks on a political settlement at an early date, said Zhao",
      "\u00a0Yet some US media outlets, which describe Belarus as Russia's \"small ally\" and smear China for allegedly considering sending Russia weapons, have used Lukashenko's visit to attempt to further bind the three nations into a bloc that needs to be defeated",
      "\u00a0\u00a0Some Western countries with a Cold War mentality are engaging in bloc confrontation with ulterior motives, said Yang Jin",
      "According to Yang, China has taken a neutral stance in the conflict, and has also provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine",

      "The expert said that the relationship between China and Belarus is already at a high level before the Ukraine crisis, which comes solely out of the mutual need for development",
      " China hopes to develop positive and healthy cooperative relations with all countries in the world for mutual benefit",

      " Nicholas Burns Photo:VCGUS Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns blatantly criticized China when he addressed the 22nd Annual Appreciation Dinner American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham China), causing dissatisfaction among AmCham China staff and industry representatives there",
      " Some executives from the US-China Business Council said it will reconsider whether to invite Burns to the celebration of the council's 50th anniversary this year, the Global Times has learned from a source",
      "Some company executives called him as \"American Wolf Warrior",
      "\"\u00a0On February 15, about 350 representatives from Chinese and US political and business sectors attended the AmCham China's annual appreciation dinner where Burns delivered a speech",
      " He criticized China's trade, state-owned enterprises, industry subsidies, cybersecurity and regulation, anti-epidemic measures and human rights policies, and even mentioned the recent unmanned airship incident",
      " His criticism of China caused dissatisfaction among the attendees",
      "\u00a0A source familiar with the matter told the Global Times on Thursday that a staff member from AmCham China said that while Burns was delivering the speech, \"the atmosphere was extremely embarrassing",
      "\" Burns brought up sensitive content many times during the dinner, despite it being the highest-level event held by the chamber every year",
      " \"Almost all the topics that the chamber wanted to avoid were mentioned by him,\" the source said",
      "\u00a0An American company executive later repeatedly asked AmCham China why Burns had been invited, as his remarks may affect future communication with relevant Chinese departments, the source said",
      "\u00a0The source said some American people on the site called Burns' speech \"nonsense\" and said the US ambassador talked about China-US relations in an inappropriate way",
      " The US-China Business Council should reconsider whether to invite Burns to this year's celebration of the council's 50th anniversary",
      "Since taking office in April 2022, Burns has often criticized China's policies in public, including on social media platforms",
      "\u00a0Many of his remarks will damage China-US relations and are inconsistent with his role as an ambassador",
      " Since the beginning of this year, Burns has used platforms such as his personal Twitter and the WeChat account of the US Embassy in China to make inappropriate remarks on issues related to human rights, Xinjiang, Xizang and Hong Kong",
      "Some Chinese experts said they do not know exactly what Burns was thinking when he uttered nonsense about China-US relations in front of Chinese and American guests on such an important occasion as AmCham China's annual appreciation dinner",
      " However, from the reactions of the American guests at the meeting, Burns obviously failed to achieve his goal, and it can be said that he \"shot himself in the foot,'' experts said",
      "\u00a0The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations clearly stipulates that one of the important responsibilities of a country's embassy is to promote friendly relations with the host country",
      " Burns' words and deeds do not seem to promote the development of friendly relations between China and the US, L\u00fc Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times",
      "\"There is already enough trouble between China and the US",
      " Burns should think more about how to be a link between the two countries, instead of being a circuit breaker,\" L\u00fc said",
      "\u00a0Another expert who preferred not to be named said that Burns, like his name \"burns\" has now become an \"ambassador who is fueling the fire,\" which will not only do nothing to help resolve the US-China conflict, but will instead continue to create new problems as an \"American wolf warrior\"",
      "\u00a0\"Burns should be cautious in his words and deeds, and not let China shout out 'Farewell, Nicholas Burns!' like an essay said 'Farewell, Leighton Stuart!' leaving a disgraceful remark in China-US relations,\" the expert said",
