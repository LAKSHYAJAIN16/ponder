      " Chengkan village in Anhui Province Photo:VCGEditor's Note:When the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) met with Chinese and foreign\u2002journalists in Beijing last year,Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, emphasized that \"On the journey ahead, we shall always act for the people and rely on them in everything we do",
      "\" It once again demonstrated Xi's deep feelings for the people",
      " Adhering to \"putting people first\" has been vividly reflected in the practice of governing the country in the new era for 10 years",
      " In this series, the Global Times selected the opinions from several experts and scholars to conduct in-depth discussions from multiple perspectives of this topic",
      " This is the first article of this series",
      "The fundamental logic of the CPC's governance is people-oriented",
      " This fundamental logic essentially embodies putting the people first",
      " This can be manifested at three levels: the ideal that bears in mind the country's most fundamental interests, the concept of governing for the people and the practice of governing the country in the new era",
      "Let people live a happy life is the country's most fundamental interestsThe CPC is from the people, for the people, and by the people",
      " \"As leader of the country, the people have put me in such a job, and I will always put the people first",
      "\" With such deep love of the people, General Secretary Xi has always cared about the country and dedicated himself to the people",
      " The concept of putting people first has rigorous theoretical argumentation and internal logic",
      " Its essence is to answer questions from the people",
      " The CPC believes realizing the people's yearning for a better life and making the people happy are the country's most fundamental interests",
      "From April 25 to 27, 2021, Xi clearly emphasized during his inspection of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region: \"The most fundamental interests of the country are the people's happy life",
      "",
      "",
      "promoting rural vitalization on all fronts will be no easier than the anti-poverty battle, allowing no letup or sluggishness",
      " We should continue to strive at a new starting point, make more notable and substantive progress toward achieving common prosperity for all",
      "\"On many important occasions, Xi repeatedly emphasized that leading officials must bear in mind the country's most fundamental interests",
      " \"The most fundamental interests of the country are the people's happy life,\" and \"continuously improve the ability to judge and understand political issues and implement political requirements",
      "\" \"Letting the people live a happy life\" is an important logic foundation to understand the country's most fundamental interests",
      "\"To seek happiness for the Chinese people\" is what Xi has devoted most of his energy in governing the country",
      " He pointed out: \"These are the things I have been busy with",
      " The country's most fundamental interests are Chinese people's well-being",
      "\"Always act for people and rely on them in everything we do, and firmly rooting in the peopleAfter the successful convening of the 18th National Congress of the CPC, President Xi paid a visit to Russia",
      " When answering questions from Russian journalists, Xi clearly answered, \"My philosophy on governance can be summed up: serving the people, and assuming the responsibilities that I ought to shoulder",
      "\" In March 2019, during Xi's visit to Italy, when answering questions from Roberto Fico, Italian lower house speaker, President Xi said affectionately that \"For the good of my people, I will put aside my own well-being",
      "\" On China's fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic, what Xi emphasized the most and what was the most important thing is to \"put the people and their lives first",
      "\" In the report to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, this people-oriented logic runs through all fields, all aspects and all links",
      "Because governing for the people is the core of the CPC's ruling philosophy",
      "There are rich theoretical connotations and rigorous theoretical logic behind governing for the people, adhering to the putting people first, and letting the people live a happy life",
      " In summary, there are four meanings and they have strict internal logic",
      " Its core is to solve the principal contradiction between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people's ever-growing needs for a better life, and focus on whether people are living a good life",
      "Its rigorous theoretical logic is: The purpose or goal of the CPC's governance is for the people; To achieve its goal, the CPC must rely on the people closely, and regard the people as the greatest source of power and the greatest strength in governance; To achieve this, we must understand that no political consideration is more important than the people",
      "We must understand that this country is its people, and the people are the country",
      "The practice of governing the country in the new era is a vivid interpretation of 'people first'The report of the 20th CPC National Congress made a comprehensive and systematic summary of the historic achievements of the 10-year great transformation in the new era, emphasizing that \"we have implemented a people-centered philosophy of development",
      "\" Along this direction, China will achieve more significant results in practice",
      "First, in economic construction, we have historically eliminated absolute poverty from more than 1",
      "4 billion people, realized a well-off society, which is the millennium dream of the Chinese nation, winning the largest battle against poverty in human history",
      "Second, in political construction, the whole-process people's democracy has been comprehensively developed, the people's status as masters of the country has become firmer, and the vitality of grassroots democracy has been strengthened",
      "Third, in cultural construction, in order to enrich people's intellectual world and enhance people's intellectual strength, we have encouraged people-centered cultural creation and production of more outstanding works that inspire the people",
      "Fourth, in social construction, we have implemented a people-centered philosophy of development, meeting the people's aspirations for better lives, and improving the people's wellbeing and raising the overall quality of life",
      " We have worked continuously to ensure people's access to childcare, education, employment, medical services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, thus bringing about an all-around improvement in people's lives",
      "Fifth, in the field of ecological civilization construction, we adhere to the principle that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets",
      " The natural environment for the people's living has been significantly improved, and the broad masses of the people have also enjoyed the well-being of a beautiful ecological environment in their work and life",
      "Sixth, in the field of Party construction, we adhere to the unity of the Party's overall leadership and comprehensive and full and rigorous Party self-governance",
      " We have resolved to \"offend a few thousand rather than fail 1",
      "4 billion\" and to clear our Party of all its ills",
      "People's support is the foundation of the country's most fundamental interests",
      " For the ruling party, adhering to the position of the people, allowing the people to be the masters of the country, and letting the people live a happy life are the country's most fundamental interests",
      " This also demonstrates the people-oriented logic of the CPC",

      " Hong Kong file photoStarting from Monday, normal travel between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland will fully resume, and all boundary control points will open up without any prescribed daily numbers of people",
      " All parts of the Hong Kong society have long awaited this day",
      " In the past few years, Hong Kong has had a difficult time: It faced the impact of the epidemic of the century shortly after the turbulence over the amendment bill in the city in 2019",
      " As a result, Hong Kong and the mainland had to implement a three-year-long border closure because of the COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control measures",
      " With the changes of the anti-COVID policies, Hong Kong and the mainland now can finally see a full border reopening",
      " This will not only inject more energy into the city's economy, but also enable Hong Kong to use its unique advantage as a \"super connector\" between China and the rest of the world",
      "Various data immediately gave a positive response",
      " The number of single-day passenger round-trip flights from the Chinese mainland to and from Hong Kong and Macao has increased to 130, while the number of single-day passenger flights in one month has increased by 171 percent month-on-month",
      " The latest report from the S&P Global shows that Hong Kong's Purchasing Managers' Indexrose to 51",
      "2 in January, the first expansion since August 2022",
      " The growth rate of new orders has been at its highest since July 2022",
      " Local companies' confidence in their businesses rose to a record high as enterprises look forward to a positive economic future",
      " One cannot fail to live up to such expectations and confidence, and this also provides a deep motivation for the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to focus on developing the economy while creating a positive public opinion environment for it",
      "In recent days, the HKSAR government has launched a series of grand measures to welcome the return to normalcy",
      " This includes the launch of the \"Hello Hong Kong\" campaign, which plans to give 700,000 free airline tickets to tourists around the world",
      " This is probably the world's largest initiative to attract tourists and is expected to attract more than 1",
      "5 million visitors from the mainland as well as from other countries and regions",
      " John Lee Ka-chiu, chief executive of the HKSAR government, is heading a delegation to Saudi Arabia and then to the United Arab Emirates, aiming to make use of the 10th launch anniversary of the China-proposedBelt and Road Initiative to strengthen trade, investment, and cultural exchanges between Hong Kong and the two countries",
      " The initiative and enthusiasm shown by the HKSAR government clearly have a leading effect on Hong Kong society",
      "\"The roads are connected, the people are connected, and the wealth is connected",
      "\" Full customs clearance means that Hong Kong has come out of the worst period of the epidemic and started a new stage to focus on recovering tourism and reviving the economy",
      " Compared with 2019, Hong Kong has undergone many new changes in the past three years",
      " Not only does it have new landmark attractions such as the Hong Kong Palace Museum and the M+, but more importantly, the Hong Kong National Security Law has been implemented, the electoral system has been improved, and the rule of law, civilization and order have basically been restored",
      " Today's Hong Kong is no longer the Hong Kong where anti-China rioters acted recklessly, nor is it a place where college and high school students cannot study at ease for fear their campuses may be attacked by thugs, nor is it a place where mainland tourists dare not speak Putonghua openly",
      " Hong Kong, where order has been restored, is ushering in a critical period of development and is set to thrive",
      "What needs to be stressed is that all this will not happen automatically, and there may not even be smooth sailing",
      " All sectors in Hong Kong need to come together with a united purpose, seize the \"window of opportunity\" and strive for new and greater development",
      " It is undeniable that Hong Kong currently faces a more complex and volatile external environment",
      " Although the anti-China forces have been suppressed, they have not disappeared",
      " They are still infiltrating, disrupting and destroying Hong Kong in various ways such as \"soft confrontation",
      "\" The US and the UK have not given up their plots and actions \"to use Hong Kong to contain China",
      "\" But as they were unable to prevent the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong in the past, they will not do so today and in the future",
      " What will greet them will be one humiliating defeat after another",
      "For Hong Kong, it is necessary to remain not only optimistic about the future, but also sober and calm about the reality",
      " It has to overcome unfavorable factors, consolidate existing advantages, and keep advancing with the times",
      " On the one hand, Hong Kong is still the original Hong Kong, adhering to the position of free trade port and relevant policies",
      " On the other hand, Hong Kong is playing the role of \"what the country needs and what Hong Kong is good at",
      "\" It is more actively aligning with the national development strategy, further integrating into the construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, actively participating in the domestic economic cycle, expanding development opportunities in the mainland, and relying on the global economic cycle and the Belt and Road Initiative for high-quality development to enhance export competitiveness",

      " Residents search for victims and survivors amidst the rubble of a collapsed building in the town of Jableh, northwest of the Syrian capital Damascus, on February 8, 2023",
      " Photo: AFPMillions of people in Syria and Turkey have suffered from the devastating earthquake that recently rattled their region, with more than 33,000 having already been confirmed killed",
      " This natural disaster has shocked the world due to the scale and scope of the destruction left in its aftermath",
      " Accordingly, international aid has begun to stream in, though the Syrian authorities have been shunned by most Western countries",
      "The US-led West imposed unilateral sanctions upon the UN-recognized Syrian government early into its over decade-long civil war that they themselves had a hand in fueling",
      " These measures were meant to pressure President Bashar al-Assad into complying with their political demands, making a blatant example of foreign countries meddling into Syria's domestic affairs which sought to terminate his government",
      " They failed to turn the majority of the population against him, however, but they have still remained in place to this day, in spite of that",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning suggested on February 8 that \"In the wake of the catastrophe, the US should put aside geopolitical obsessions and immediately lift the unilateral sanctions on Syria, to unlock the doors for humanitarian aid to Syria",
      "\" This stance is aligned with international law, humanitarian and moral",
      "UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced on February 9 that \"the humanitarian crisis in northwestern Syria was already worsening, with needs at their highest level since the conflict began",
      "\" He stressed, \"this is a moment in which everybody must make very clear that no sanctions of any kind interfere with relief to the population of Syria in the present moment",
      "\"Continuing to unilaterally impose sanctions outside the authority of the United Nations Security Council only perpetuates Syrians' suffering",
      " Clinging to the failed policy of punishing average people through economic means, which is done with the intent of encouraging them to turn against their government and thus advance America's foreign policy goals, is counterproductive from the standpoint of the US' objective interests after such disasters",
      "Under huge pressure from the international community, the US Treasury late on February 9 announced a 180-day exemption to its sanctions on Syria for \"all transactions related to earthquake relief efforts",
      "\"From the standpoint of US interests, this development can help improve the targeted population's perception of it, making them believe Washington is tangibly relieving some of their suffering",
      " Keeping the sanctions in place would generate deeper resentment since people would begin to feel that the US wants them to cruelly suffer as additional punishment for failing to turn against their government up until this point",
      " Instead of advancing US interests, that policy would have thus further eroded them",
      "Upon selectively and temporarily lifting its sanctions against Syria in response to that country's natural disaster, it's possible that the US is establishing a new precedent",
      " If another sanctioned country experiences a similar disaster, the US might therefore selectively and temporarily relieve its sanctions too on the pretext of facilitating the shipment of aid",
      " This doesn't mean that a breakthrough is guaranteed to follow, but each side would benefit by at least giving that scenario a chance",
      " It makes perfect sense for Washington to explore this possibility at this precise time since there's never been a better one to do so",
      "To summarize, the US' decision to selectively and temporarily lift its sanctions against Syria is likely driven more by political pragmatism than humanitarian motives",
      " Washington is aiming to alleviate international pressure on it and improving Syrian people's perception of the US",
      " It remains to be seen whether Washington is also possibly creating the political opportunity for resuming talks with Syrian leadership",

      " Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia Hun Sen at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, capital of China, Feb 10, 2023",
      " Photo:XinhuaChinese President Xi Jinping met with visiting Prime Minister of Cambodia Hun Sen on Friday in Beijing",
      " During this visit, the two sides reached a consensus on the China-Cambodia \"Diamond Hexagon\" cooperation framework, showing that the Belt and Road cooperation between China and Cambodia is more open, higher-quality, more balanced and more sustainable",
      " Specifically, cooperation in the fields of production capacity, energy and agriculture will create more new highlights, benefit more people, and inject strong impetus into regional peace and stability",
      "China-Cambodia cooperation is in full swing, which has made some American media restless",
      " Worrying that Cambodia and China are getting too close, they try to use the \"debt trap\" rhetoric to discredit the China-Cambodia high-speed rail cooperation and drive a wedge between the two countries",
      " However, this move will obviously not succeed",
      "This is not the first time that the US and Western media have concocted the \"debt trap\" theory to discredit China's cooperation with countries along the Belt and Road",
      " In response to the Sri Lanka crisis and China-Myanmar cooperation projects, some American and Western media are keen to talk about the \"debt trap\" theory and use this rhetoric to intimidate the countries involved in order to coerce them to draw a line with China",
      "In a certain sense, the \"debt trap\" theory politicizes and ideologizes debt based on Western standards and value judgments, and is a replica of typical Western-centric theories",
      " In fact, when China conducts project cooperation with countries along the Belt and Road, it pursues the concept of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, and has never unilaterally imposed its own will on these countries",
      " For example, the high-speed rail cooperation between China and Cambodia adopts the BOT (build-operate-transfer) model, which is not like a simple Western loan model, but an investment-based one that follows the laws of the market",
      "When analyzing high-speed rail revenues, the West, based on its own development experience, speculates on China's relative revenues in countries along the Belt and Road, which is logically deceptive",
      " This is because high-speed rail income must calculate not only the income from passenger ticket prices and cargo transportation, but should also include the comprehensive income of commercial development along the high-speed railway",
      " The West often only calculates the former, but lacks the analysis and judgment from its own experience for the latter, which is a major flaw",
      "At the same time, the Western analysis of the debt structure also lacks a reasonable basis",
      " The vast majority of the debts of those developing countries currently facing a \"debt crisis,\" as hyped by the US and the West, come from loans from international multilateral institutions, while loans from China only account for a small proportion of it",
      " Moreover, most of the loans provided by China are in US dollars",
      " If there is a \"debt crisis\" in Cambodia, it is more likely to be caused by the dollar's interest rate hikes",
      " What's more, Cambodia's current accumulated external debt is $9",
      "579 billion, accounting for about 35 percent of its GDP, which is lower than the debt pressure ceiling (40 percent) set by the International Monetary Fund",
      " In other words, Cambodia has its foreign debt under control",
      "It should be noted that as the US continues to promote the Indo-Pacific Strategy, the \"debt trap\" theory has gradually become a discourse trap used by the US and the West to deliberately raise infrastructure standards and discredit the Belt and Road Initiative",
      " However, the Belt and Road projects have not been affected, and China and the countries along the route are jointly adhering to the concept of high standards, benefiting people's livelihood and sustainability, and are promoting the construction of relevant projects with high quality",
      " This shows that the strong endogenous driving force of the Belt and Road Initiative cannot be stopped by the clamor of public opinion in the US and the West",
      "It is worth mentioning that 2023 is the 10th anniversary of the proposal to jointly develop the Belt and Road Initiative",
      " Over the past 10 years, China and Cambodia have made remarkable achievements in Belt and Road cooperation, which has become a model for the joint construction of the Belt and Road",
      " Whether it is the Golden Port Expressway or the Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone, it has played a positive role in promoting the connectivity of Cambodia and stimulating the development of the local economy",
      "2023 is also the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia and the Year of China-Cambodia Friendship",
      " The joint construction of a community of shared future between China and Cambodia will usher in a new era of construction",
      " At this critical juncture, the latest cooperation between the two countries will surely promote the development of the China-Cambodia community of shared future in the direction of high quality, high level and high standards in the new era",
      " The practice of building a community of shared future between China and Cambodia has proven that the two sides adhere to mutual respect, equal treatment, and win-win cooperation to promote the construction of a new type of international relations",
      " In the new era, the China-Cambodia community with a shared future will only become more stable and solid",

      "To achieve this goal, CASIC will build a satellite constellation in very-low Earth orbit so that it can reach a performance level that rivals traditional orbital satellite systems while offering lower costs and faster responses",
      " It will also support the constellation construction with rapid batch manufacturing and launch capabilities",
      "The first satellite of the series will be ready to be launched in September, the Global Times learned",

      " Photo: AFPAs tension between China and the US is worsening due to the US' hysterical overreaction in shooting down China's unmanned civilian-use airship, the US military, politicians and media have moved on to hype another issue - that the so-called number of China's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launchers has surpassed that of the US",
      "Thismakes the toxic atmosphere of a new cold war swell further, Chinese analysts said on Wednesday",
      "The US is using this unexpected incident as an excuse to justify its demands for an increase in the defense budget to expand its nuclear arsenal and upgrade its ICBM launching platforms like nuclear submarines, said military experts",
      " The claim that China has built more ICBM launchers than the US is speculation based on exaggeration and the \"China threat theory,\" said analysts",
      "More importantly, the US has more nuclear warheads than China does, and it is unreasonable and unfair for the US to use China's nuclear buildup to justify its own hegemonic nuclear ambition that could break the nuclear balance between major powers and threated world peace, experts said",
      "The US military has notified the Congress that China now has more land-based intercontinental-range missile launchers than the US, \"fueling the debate about how the US should respond to China's nuclear buildup,\" said a report by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday",

      "Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Wednesday that \"according to the data from the US Department of Defense, the US has at least 450 silos, which is a huge number, and if the US military claimed that the number of China's land-based fixed and mobile ICBM launchers is larger than 450, then this could be a completely exaggerated speculation",

      "\"Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times on Wednesday that \"the US military and politicians are using trickery to fool the US public",
      " The US' strategic nuclear capabilities mainly consist of sea-based and air-based launch platforms, so when they compare land-based launchers in the US and China, they are just finding excuses to support their China threat theory for their own greedy purposes",

      " Li Yining File Photo: VCGLi Yining, a pioneer of economic reform in China, passed away on Monday night",
      " Li was known for his staunch advocacy of reforming state-owned enterprises and his role in the establishment of China's stock market",
      "Li, honorary dean of the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University, died at a hospital in Beijing on Monday due to illness, read a statement on the official website of Peking University",
      " The university has set up a funeral working group to carry out related work, and all faculty members and students mourn the passing of Professor Li, the statement said",
      "Born on November 22, 1930 in Nanjing, East China's Jiangsu Province, Li graduated from Peking University in 1955 with a bachelor's degree in economics and has been teaching at his alma mater ever since his graduation",
      " Over the years, Li also held prominent positions at various government bodies, including the National People's Congress, China's top legislative body, and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China's top political advisory body",
      "Above all, Li was known for his remarkable contributions to China's economic reform and development",
      " In the early days of China's reform and opening-up, while many advocated for price reform as the priority of China's economic reform agenda, Li criticized the view and fiercely advocated for reform of ownership",
      "\"The failure of China's reform may be caused by the failure of price reform, but the success of Chinese economic reform is by no means determined by the success of price reform, but by the success of ownership reform,\" he pointed out at the time, according to his biography on Peking University's website",
      "The runaway inflation in the country in 1988 proved the validity of Li's view, and reform of state-owned enterprises later became a priority of China's economic reform and reform of state-owned enterprises continues to be a top priority for Chinese policymakers today",
      "Another great achievement of Li's career was his share-holding theory and advocacy of building a share-holding system despite considerable pushback from some critics who opposed \"over-privatization",
      "\" Because of his advocacy of the share-holding theory, which is widely believed to have helped the establishment of China's stock markets in 1990, Li is known both in China and abroad as \"Mr Stock Market Li",
      "\"Throughout his career, Li has been steadfast in advocating economic reforms",
      " During a memorable moment at a press conference on the sidelines of the two sessions in 2014, Li, who was a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC at the time, took a harsh view of what he called \"hard nuts\" that impeded China's reform: vested interests and systemic inertia",
      "\"Economic reform has taken more than 30 years",
      " The situation now is different",
      " All the easy reforms are done and the rest are tough,\" Li said, adding that a major obstacle is the strong vested interest of those who profit from the status quo",
      "Li was the author of many influential books on China's economic reform, including \"Ideas on China's Economic Reform,\" \"China's Economic Reform and Share-holding System\" and \"The Share-holding System and Modern Market Economy",
      "\"In recognition of his remarkable contribution to China's economic reform, Li was awarded the honorary title of \"Pioneer of China's Reform and Opening-up",
      "\"Li has been one of the most influential economists in China since the very beginning of China's transition to a market economy in 1979, said Justin Lin Yifu, also a prominent economist at Peking University, according to a post on the website of the university",
      "Apart from his contribution to China's economic reform, Li has also made notable achievements in other areas, including ethics in economics",
      " He was among the first scholars to propose that moral regulation should play an important role in market regulation, according to Peking University",
      "Since 2003, Li has also been focusing on economic development in the private sector, advocating support for the private economy",
      "Reflecting Li's great achievements and widespread popularity, many Chinese netizens took to social media to mourn his passing",
      " News of his death became a trending topic on social media platforms",
      " On Sina Weibo, the topic for the news of Li's passing drew over 83",

      " Photo: VCGChina expressed strong dissatisfaction and protest on Sunday against the US' move to shoot down a non-threatening Chinese airship for civilian use, calling the US' move an overreaction and vowing to reserve the right to take necessary actions",
      " By turning an unintentional accident into an incident that has been hyped by the US officials and media, Washington is adding new uncertainties into the already-intense relations with China, creating a bad precedent for blurring the line between civilian and military uses, experts said",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed strong dissatisfaction and protested against the US' use of force to shoot down a Chinese civilian unmanned airship, urging the US to properly handle the incident",
      "The Chinese side has verified the situation and communicated with the US side multiple times, saying the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace was due to force majeure and the incident was totally an accident, the ministry said",
      "The US military on Saturday local time shot down a \"suspected Chinese spy balloon\" off the Carolina coast following an authorization of the Biden administration after the airship has been flying over the US for days",
      " The action was hailed by the US President Joe Biden as \"a success,\" according to US media reports",
      "The \"balloon episode\" went viral on the US social media",
      " A number of US hawks on China-related matters have been hyping the use of balloon for spying purpose and deliberately distorted it as \"a direct assault on the US national sovereignty",
      "\"\"The US attack on Chinese civilian unmanned airship by force is an obvious overreaction,\" Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, a spokesperson at China's Ministry of National Defense, said in a statement on Sunday",
      "China will reserve the right to take necessary measures in dealing with similar situations, Tan said",
      "Tan's remarks mean that if a foreign airship accidentally enters the Chinese airspace, the Chinese forces could also shoot it down in a similar manner, observers said",
      "Biden was first briefed on the balloon Tuesday and has been receiving updates from his national security team, CNN said",
      " The Pentagon earlier said on Friday that the balloon did not pose a \"military or physical\" threat",
      "Despite China's multiple communication with the US, the US government decided to shoot down a non-threatening airship that accidentally entered its airspace, turning an accident into an incident, which also added new uncertainties into already strained US-China relations, some Chinese experts said",
      " From the military perspective, the latest action of the US is like \"shooting a mosquito with cannon,\" experts said",
      "Significant consequencesAlthough the US knows that this airship is harmless, it insisted on shooting it down to maintain its dominant position and it's also believed that the US is very interested in our related technology so that it needs to obtain it in such improper way, L\u00fc Xiang, research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "\"In fact, such high-altitude balloon is equipped with cutting-edge technologies in terms of material, which the US side may have yet had",
      " Shooting it down caused the loss for the Chinese side and the relevant technology research firm has the right to file claims against the US,\" L\u00fc said",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Friday that the balloon is a civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes",
      " Affected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, the airship deviated far from its planned course",
      "However, some US politicians and media have been hyping the so-called threat of this civilian airship, for example, Republican senator Tom Cotton and Texas governor Greg Abbott have been urging the Biden administration to bring it down, otherwise, it's dereliction of duty",
      "\"From the US government to public opinion, the balloon incident has been exploited to instigate fermenting anti-China sentiment, which will only make the US' China policy more aggressive,\" Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "The US ignoring the communication with the Chinese side further shows that the US lacks sincerity",
      " Although it has been talking about setting the guardrails for the US-China relations, it has been blatantly sabotaging these guardrails, Li said",
      "Overreaction, bad precedentThe US shooting down the Chinese civilian balloon is also considered an overreaction from a technical point of view, said military aviation experts",
      "Despite admitting that the balloon did not pose a military or physical threat, an F-22 fighter of the US Air Force fired an AIM-9X air-to-air missile and shot down the balloon, supported by F-15 fighters, tankers and warships, the Pentagon said on the day on its website",
      "The missile was fired from the F-22 from an altitude of 58,000 feet (17,678 meters) when the balloon was 60,000 and 65,000 feet, the Pentagon said",
      "This is like shooting a mosquito with a cannon, which is not only overreacting but also impractical, a Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "Compared with an unmanned balloon that flies with the wind, the US interception method that featured an advanced stealth fighter jet and fired a missile is too costly",
      " If more balloons, not necessarily from China, fly across the US, the US Air Force would be exhausted and may even be bankrupted in intercepting them in this way, the expert said",
      "It is more of a political show, as the balloon was only shot down after it already travelled across the US and was about to leave, experts said",
      "Some experts also believe that shooting down a harmless airship is like \"shooting down an unarmed civilian,\" creating a bad precedent for interaction between China and the US",
      "It's widely known that US aircraft, appearing in civilian or military purposes, operate around China much more frequent than Chinese aircraft do around the US, L\u00fc noted",
      "\"If the US does not differentiate between civilian and military aircraft, then it has made a very bad precedent in treating the China-US relations,\" he said",
      "The US frequently conducts close-in reconnaissance on China's doorsteps in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Straits and the East China Sea, sometimes in civilian disguises, according to a think tank and media reports",
      "\"If the US does not make the difference, should China make a difference? Should China also take reciprocal measures? The US must carefully consider the consequences,\" L\u00fc said",

      " In this Sept 12, 2019 photo, China's Permanent Representative to the UN Zhang Jun speaks at the UN headquarters in New York",
      "(Photo: Xinhua)A Chinese envoy called on the international community to take all necessary actions to rigorously slow down global warming and contain the trend of rapid sea-level rises during a United Nations (UN) Security Council debate on Tuesday",
      "The international community should step up forward-looking studies on the consequences of rising sea levels, and in the meantime, focus on climate change as its root cause, rigorously slow down global warming, and contain the trend of rapid sea-level rises, Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the UN, told a Security Council debate on \"Sea-level Rise: Implications for International Peace and Security",
      "\"According to Zhang, to achieve the temperature cap set in the Paris Agreement, developed countries must take the lead in further reducing emissions",
      " However, since last year, there has been a backtracking of the energy policy of some developed countries and an increase rather than decrease in their fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions, which makes the already elusive global emissions reduction prospect even more precarious",
      "Most developed countries set forth their carbon peaking and carbon neutrality targets and programs relatively early and they should set an example by taking concrete actions for their implementation, Zhang said",
      "Zhang pointed out that financing always lies at the heart of and is a key issue for global climate governance",
      " Developed countries are obliged and responsible for providing climate change financing and assistance to developing countries",
      "\"As early as 2009, developed countries pledged $100 billion annually to developing countries, which has yet to be truly delivered up to date, making their so-called commitment nothing but an empty promise,\" Zhang said",
      "Worse still, some countries, while passively responding to the funding needs of developing countries, invests hundreds of billions of dollars in hefty subsidies for domestic manufacturing through the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, purportedly to promote its energy transition, according to Zhang",
      "\"Such hypocritical and self-serving, green protectionism violates WTO rules, discriminates against relevant industries in other countries, and undermines the collective efforts to tackle climate change globally,\" Zhang said",
      "Adhering to true multilateralism and strengthening solidarity and cooperation are the only way out in addressing the climate change challenge, Zhang noted",
      "\"We should stick to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, which bears on international equity and justice",
      " Deviation from this principle will severely damage the unity and cooperation of the international community to tackle climate change,\" Zhang said",
      "Zhang also noted that small island developing states are most exposed to climate shocks, but the least adaptable at the same time",
      " The international community should effectively address the concerns and needs of small island developing states, and help them with capacity building through financial and technical assistance",
      " The marine environment conservation is a common responsibility of humankind",
      "According to Zhang, a pressing challenge is the discharge of nuclear contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant, which will seriously damage the marine environment and people's health, with small island developing states and their people bearing the brunt",

      " Illustration: Liu Rui/GTVeteran journalist Seymour Hersh's investigative report, that the US was behind the Nord Stream pipelines sabotage, is supposed to be a bomb in news cycle",
      " Yet Western media outlets, who are normally always hungry for scoops, have covered their eyes and ears",
      " Amid the silence, a handful of Western reports that touched upon the disclosure are filled with suspicion toward Hersh",
      "At the sage of 85, Hersh, a Pulitzer Prize winner, unveiled not only the hidden hand behind the mysterious Nord Stream explosions, but also an unspoken truth that Western media, which labels itself as being free and independent, has totally become a propaganda arm of Washington",
      "Business Insider, which called Hersh \"investigative journalist\" in 2015, labeled him as \"discredited\" on February 9",
      " On the same day, Der Spiegel named Hersh a \"controversial US journalist",
      "\" But in 2016, the media outlet dubbed him \"legendary",
      "\" Apparently, because of the Nord Stream report, Hersh turned from \"legendary\" to \"controversial\" and even \"discredited",
      "\" Because when Washington wants to rob the public blind over the case and make them angry at Russia, Hersh set a roadblock",
      "Hersh's disclosure is supposed to promote, or pile pressure on, relevant investigations",
      " Yet right after the White House rejected Hersh's claims, media outlets from the US, and even those from other Western world, kept up with the stance",
      " They have made a clear-cut posture - when divergences occur between professional journalism and interest groups, they would take the side of the latter, and flush the pursuit of truth into toilet",
      " This also makes people doubt whether they are covering secrets for the current US administration",
      "A more noteworthy phenomenon is not the change of Hersh's reputation, but the widespread silence of Western media's response",
      " It's been days after the revelation, why hasn't the all-mighty US propaganda machine made any powerful case to contradict or overturn the accusation against Washington? When the US failed to disapprove the claims, it signals that the White House could really be a major suspect, Shen Yi, a professor at Fudan University, told the Global Times",
      "If that is the case, it means the US has stabbed its allies' backs in real sense",
      " Yet blowing up Nord Stream pipelines is a terrorist act",
      " Some observers even call its nature viler than the September 11 attacks",
      " Without doubt, the US will not admit it",
      " As former President George HW Bush's once said, \"I will never apologize for the United States - I don't care what the facts are",
      "\" The reason is simple, acknowledging or apologizing the wrong deeds US committed could shake the legitimacy of US leaders' political power",
      "In such a toxic American political atmosphere, there is almost no room for facts, truth, and criticism against the establishment",
      "Hersh first gained recognition in 1969 for exposing the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War, for which he received the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting",
      " At that time, a growing number of Americans were wising up to the fact that the US could not win the war",
      " Hersh's report helped political forces who wanted to pull American troops out the battlefield",
      " That was a period of time when US political elites were willing to make self-examination on their policies",
      " Those days are over",
      " At present, US policymakers are stuck in their arrogance, without any interest to make introspection",
      " US media outlets playing fool in the face of Hersh's latest report is a sign",
      "However, when both elites and the media are reluctant to disagree with mainstream US narrative, the country may run into greater blunder in the future",
      "The North Stream case has not been settled",
      " But the question of who are harmed and who have benefited is as plain as daylight",
      " At this point, media outlets from US allies, especially those from Germany, should think twice before throwing their weight behind whitewashing Washington",
      " What good would turning themselves as US propaganda assets do? After all, Germany is a vivid example of \"to be an enemy of America can be dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal",

      " Some executives from the US-China Business Council said it will reconsider whether to invite Burns to the celebration of the council's 50th anniversary this year, the Global Times has learned from a source",
      "Some company executives called him as \"American Wolf Warrior",
      "\"On February 15, about 350 representatives from Chinese and US political and business sectors attended the AmCham China's annual appreciation dinner where Burns delivered a speech",
      " He criticized China's trade, state-owned enterprises, industry subsidies, cybersecurity and regulation, anti-epidemic measures and human rights policies, and even mentioned the recent unmanned airship incident",
      " His criticism of China caused dissatisfaction among the attendees",
      "A source familiar with the matter told the Global Times on Thursday that a staff member from AmCham China said that while Burns was delivering the speech, \"the atmosphere was extremely embarrassing",
      "\" Burns brought up sensitive content many times during the dinner, despite it being the highest-level event held by the chamber every year",
      " \"Almost all the topics that the chamber wanted to avoid were mentioned by him,\" the source said",
      "An American company executive later repeatedly asked AmCham China why Burns had been invited, as his remarks may affect future communication with relevant Chinese departments, the source said",
      "The source said some American people on the site called Burns' speech \"nonsense\" and said the US ambassador talked about China-US relations in an inappropriate way",
      " The US-China Business Council should reconsider whether to invite Burns to this year's celebration of the council's 50th anniversary",
      "Since taking office in April 2022, Burns has often criticized China's policies in public, including on social media platforms",
      "Many of his remarks will damage China-US relations and are inconsistent with his role as an ambassador",
      " Since the beginning of this year, Burns has used platforms such as his personal Twitter and the WeChat account of the US Embassy in China to make inappropriate remarks on issues related to human rights, Xinjiang, Xizang and Hong Kong",
      "Some Chinese experts said they do not know exactly what Burns was thinking when he uttered nonsense about China-US relations in front of Chinese and American guests on such an important occasion as AmCham China's annual appreciation dinner",
      " However, from the reactions of the American guests at the meeting, Burns obviously failed to achieve his goal, and it can be said that he \"shot himself in the foot,'' experts said",
      "The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations clearly stipulates that one of the important responsibilities of a country's embassy is to promote friendly relations with the host country",
      " Burns' words and deeds do not seem to promote the development of friendly relations between China and the US, L\u00fc Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times",
      "\"There is already enough trouble between China and the US",
      " Burns should think more about how to be a link between the two countries, instead of being a circuit breaker,\" L\u00fc said",
      "Another expert who preferred not to be named said that Burns, like his name \"burns\" has now become an \"ambassador who is fueling the fire,\" which will not only do nothing to help resolve the US-China conflict, but will instead continue to create new problems as an \"American wolf warrior\"",
      "\"Burns should be cautious in his words and deeds, and not let China shout out 'Farewell, Nicholas Burns!' like an essay said 'Farewell, Leighton Stuart!' leaving a disgraceful remark in China-US relations,\" the expert said",

      " In the document, China will reiterate that a nuclear war must never be fought and cannot be won, Wang said, adding that China also urges efforts to ensure the security of civil nuclear facilities, stands against attacking nuclear power plants, and will advocate joint efforts to oppose to the use of biochemical weapons",
      " The more complex the situation, the greater the need to remain cool-headed and pragmatic, Wang said, stressing that China is willing to join hands with all parties to continue the efforts for realizing peace at an early date",

      "Experts said on Thursday that the move marked China's enhanced defense cooperation with the UAE, after the Arab country halted a deal to purchase F-35 fighter jets from the US",
      "Jointly sponsored by the Chinese Aeronautical Establishment and the China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation (CATIC), the UAE Joint Lab opened on Tuesday, with the aim of working with Arab countries to explore aerospace cooperation, the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) announced on Wednesday",
      "The two sides will focus on basic, utility and frontier technologies, carry out aviation research and development as well as talent cultivation, and build a technology cradle overseas, AVIC said",
      "The announcement came shortly after AVIC revealed on Tuesday that CATIC has successfully signed a contract with the UAE for the exports of the domestically developed L15 advanced trainer jet during the 16th International Defense Exhibition and Conference (IDEX), which is being held from Monday to Friday in Abu Dhabi",
      "In December 2021, the UAE suspended a deal to buy US-made F-35 fighter jets and drones due to US attempts to limit Chinese technology sales, including Huawei 5G, in the Arab country, Reuters reported at the time",
      "Zhang Xuefeng, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times that although Western defense firms continue to be the main arms suppliers to Middle Eastern countries, they are failing to dominate the market in the region",
      "Arms procurement involves geopolitical, performance and cost factors, and rich Middle Eastern countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia are getting tired of the tight political strings the US attaches to arms sales when other suppliers can also provide equivalent products, Zhang said",

      "Weapons and equipment in these categories have gained public attention, as they were deployed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, observers said",

      " This comes as Russia appointed a new commander of the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine and declared a military victory in Soledar in eastern Ukraine",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday that the goals of Moscow's \"special military operation\" in Ukraine are \"determined by Russia's core legitimate interests\" and will be fulfilled, media reported",
      "\"There must be no military infrastructure in Ukraine that poses a direct threat to our country,\" Lavrov said, adding that Moscow also intends to make sure the rights of ethnic Russians in Ukraine were protected",
      "Speaking at an annual news conference on Wednesday, Lavrov dismissed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's demands for a complete Russian withdrawal from Ukraine",
      " The minister also dismissed Ukraine's insistence on payments for war damages and the prosecution of war criminals as a platform for future talks, saying \"there can be no talks with Zelensky",
      "\"Lavrov alleged \"the West makes all the decisions for Ukraine\" with the goal of using the conflict to exhaust Russia",

      "",
      "We and China see all these games,\" he said",

      "Ahead of the NATO meeting, the top US military officer, Army General Mark Milley, traveled to a site near the Ukraine-Poland border on Tuesday and talked to his Ukrainian counterpart face to face for the first time - a meeting underscoring the growing ties between the two militaries and coming at a critical time as Russia's war with Ukraine nears the one-year mark, the AP reported",
      "Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met for a couple of hours with Ukraine's chief military officer, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, at an undisclosed location in southeastern Poland",
      " The two leaders have talked frequently about Ukraine's military needs and the state of the war over the past year but had never met",
      "The meeting comes as the international community ramps up military assistance to Ukraine, including expanded training of Ukrainian troops by the US and the provision of a Patriot missile battery, tanks and increased air defense and other weapons systems from the US and a coalition of European and other nations",
      "On the Russian side, Chief of the General Staff Army General Valery Gerasimov on January 11 was appointed commander of the integrated group of forces of the special military operation in Ukraine",
      "Chinese military experts said this appointment means that Moscow wants to upgrade the \"special military operation\" to \"a war\" because it needs the top military commander of the country to coordinate the joint operation conducted by the Russian national armed forces, Chechnya's military forces and private military contractor the Wagner Group",
      "Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies at East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Wednesday that \"since December 2022, Ukraine has faced increasing difficulties in the battlefield, as its troops are suffering from increasing losses and European countries are increasingly reluctant to keep providing expensive military assistance",
      "\"Apart from the difficult situation on the battlefield, Ukraine is also suffering from the loss of a senior official and civilian casualties caused by a helicopter crash",
      "At least 15 people, including Ukraine's interior minister, other senior ministry officials and three children were killed on Wednesday morning when a helicopter crashed near a nursery outside Kiev, Reuters reported",
      "At this moment, Kiev is facing a severe situation and it needs a military victory as soon as possible to reinforce its image among the West, especially when NATO is holding a meeting to discuss future military assistance, Cui noted",
      " \"For the Russian side, under the command of Gerasimov, the Russian troops' performance has improved in recent days, and their firepower has been strengthened,\" he said",
      "Russia wishes to end the military operation in 2023 because the presidential election in 2024 is highly important for the future of the country, so the Kremlin will strengthen inputs to the battlefield when its attempts to seek a cease-fire through diplomacy have been rebuffed by Ukraine and the West, experts said",
      "Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, said \"since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, only one NATO member is really putting efforts into mediation - Turkey",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/GTWashington's attempt to lure Manila into its anti-China orbit has become more evident recently",
      " It is now using every opportunity to sow discord between China and the Philippines in a bid to rope in Manila to its side to jointly contain China",
      "Referring to the latest laser incident, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Monday \"The United States stands with our Philippine allies",
      "\" Washington sees the laser incident as a fresh chance to achieve the goal",
      " The US' hype over the laser incident as well as the country's attempt to groundlessly label the laser incident as \"an armed attack\" is evidently provocative",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson has denied the accusation of the Philippine side, saying a Chinese coast guard ship did not direct laser light at the crew on a Philippine coast guard ship, which intruded into waters off the Ren'ai Reef without China's permission on February 6 and a Chinese coast guard ship had to take measures in accordance with law and warned them away",
      " The instrument used won't cause damage to personnel or equipment",
      "The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), which was signed between the US and the Philippines in April 2014, has an initial validity of 10 years, and will automatically be in force until a one-year notice is given by either party to terminate the agreement",
      " And the first chance comes up in April this year",
      " In this context, Washington's frequent exchanges with Manila, and expressing the willingness to support the Philippines against China can be regarded as the US' bid to pressure Manila to renew the agreement",
      "In the light of current situation, the possibility of renewal is high",
      " Given Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr has allowed US troops to access four more military bases in his country, he has desire and interest in beefing up military cooperation with Washington",
      " Its renewal will pose a severe security threat to China",
      " Although officials declined to name the locations of the additional four military bases, according to sources, at least one of them will be situated in the Luzon Island, a place close to the Taiwan island",
      " That is to say that after the EDCA extension, the Philippines' cooperation with US in the latter's military bases located in the Philippines will be intensified, posing a security challenge to the Taiwan Straits and as well as the South China Sea",
      "It can be argued that the US is the biggest security peril and unstable trigger in the South China Sea and even the entire Asia-Pacific region",
      " Washington has racked its brain to muddy the waters of the South China Sea so that it can fish out of the troubled waters and achieve the goal of containing China",
      "The US sees the Philippines as a critical strategic piece to contain China in the Asia-Pacific",
      " Among the ASEAN members, the Philippines, a traditional ally of the US, has a unique status",
      " By driving a wedge between China and the Philippines, Washington wants the Philippines to take sides with it, helping the US achieve the goal of containing China on the South China Sea issue as well as the Taiwan question",
      "As for the Philippines, Marcos Jr' recent moves are a bit disappointing",
      " Even though his foreign policy can still fall into the framework of balanced diplomacy, the tendency of leaning toward the US has become a bit evident",
      " Apart from allowing the US to access four more military bases, his visit to Japan can also exemplify, during which the Philippines said it is considering a trilateral defense pact with the US and Japan",
      "But it should be clear to Manila that Washington is unreliable",
      " It has always been evident that the US puts its own interests over anything else in its foreign policy",
      " For example, although Biden said he attaches great importance to the relationship with Seoul, his Inflation Reduction Act still suppresses South Korean industries",
      " Thus, the Philippines should not expect that the US will have its back",
      " Currently, Washington's courtship toward the Philippines comes out of the latter's value in helping containing China",
      " And once Manila is in trouble or its interests go against the US', Washington will not stand up for it, or even stab it in the back",
      "In the great power competition, the US' primary strategy is to use its alliances, which is prominent under Democratic administrations, especially the Biden administration",
      " The US uses Ukraine as a pawn against Russia, while roping in allies, such as South Korea and the Philippines, to contain China",
      " But the effect of the US' small clique, as well as its bilateral and trilateral coordination attempts in the Asia-Pacific, will be highly limited",

      " The opening meeting of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress is held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 5, 2023",
      " Photo: VCGChina has set its annual GDP growth target at around 5 percent for 2023, as the country embarked on a rapid economic recovery after a decisive victory against COVID-19, while putting emphasis on ensuring economic stability and high-quality growth, sustainable development amid global economic volatility and geopolitical uncertainty",
      "While the growth target is reportedly the lowest in dozens of years, it still means China will continue to be one of the world's fastest-growing major economies, as the global economy is widely expected to further slow down this year and major economies such as the US and the EU are grappling with the risks of recession, analysts noted",
      "Many economists said that the world's second-largest economy will likely outperform the target despite facing a series of external risks and challenges, pointing to the country's accelerating recovery and solid economic fundamentals, as well as sufficient policy tools to tackle those risks and challenges",
      "Prioritizing stabilityThe GDP growth target, along with other economic development goals, was released in the Government Work Report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang on Sunday to the first session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC)",
      "\"This year, it is essential to prioritize economic stability and pursue progress while ensuring stability",
      " Policies should be kept consistent and targeted, and they should be carried out in a more coordinated way to create synergy for high-quality development,\" Premier Li said in the Government Work Report",
      "The economic target reflects policymakers' confidence in the country's economic performance this year, as China's economy has rebounded at a pace faster than anticipated in the two months after the country optimized its COVID-19 response, but authorities have taken potentially unexpected factors into consideration given the toughened geopolitical situation and global economic weakness, officials and experts said",
      "Zhang Yansheng, chief researcher of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, told the Global Times on Sunday that China's economy might outperform the 5 percent target this year, and that the IMF is likely to further raise forecasts for China's economic growth to 5",
      "8-6 percent this year",
      "The IMF recently forecast a GDP growth of 5",
      "2 percent for China this year and 2",
      "9 percent for global growth",

      "",
      "",
      " But officials set the GDP growth target at a little slower than that level to show their emphasis on high-quality development and pursuit of a sustainable growth pattern,\" he told the Global Times",
      "In the first two months of 2023, China's economy performed much better than expected in areas ranging from tourism and entertainment to manufacturing",
      " Based on the fast recovery, global institutions have raised their forecasts for the country's economic growth this year",
      "Moody's recently raised its forecast for China's real GDP growth to 5 percent for both 2023 and 2024, up from previous projections of 4 percent, noting that the government's decision to optimize its COVID-19 response will naturally boost the country's economic activities",
      "Deloitte China Chair Jiang Ying told the Global Times on Sunday that the work report shows the government wants to take a balanced and holistic approach among short-term contingency measures and mid- and long-term development strategies, faced with rising uncertainty in the external environment and a fledgling domestic recovery that still need to be consolidated",
      "\"An effective lift in quality and a reasonable increment in quantity is targeted here",
      " And a 5-percent-growth target faces a high likelihood of being realized,\" she said",
      "By setting a 5 percent target, it means that China will function as the world's major economic engine this year, as the global economy is widely expected to slow amid geopolitical tensions and monetary policy fluctuations",
      "Tian Yun, a veteran macroeconomic observer, said that China's growth target this year will likely exceed most economies except countries that are at an early stage of industrialization, like Vietnam and India",
      "\"As China's economic growth gathers pace, the country's contribution to global economic growth will return to about 30 percent this year,\" he told the Global Times",
      "Focusing on qualityLooking closely at policymakers' economic goals in specific areas, experts said that this year's economic targets reflect a policy emphasis on stability and high-quality development based on what they see as highlights of this year's Government Work Report",
      "Consumption has been prioritized, with Premier Li stressing in the Government Work Report that China should give priority to the recovery and expansion of consumption",
      "\"Measures on boosting domestic demand, such as raising the income of mid- and low-income groups, boosting new-energy vehicle(NEV) sales and supporting the development of the elder care sector are likely to fully release people's consumption power from both the supply and demand-side,\" Jiang said",
      "The Government Work Report included preventing and defusing major economic and financial risks as one of the major priorities this year, while stressing that the transition to green development should continue",
      "The Report set higher other economic indicators compared with last year",
      " For example, China's deficit-to-GDP ratio is projected at 3 percent for 2023, 0",
      "2 percentage points higher than 2022, which signifies more active fiscal stimulus",
      " The government has set a higher goal for employment, targeting the creation of 12 million new urban jobs in 2023, compared with the target of \"more than 11 million\" last year",
      "\"Those highlights point to one thing: that the government is putting more focus on high-quality development instead of just chasing numeric targets,\" Tian said, adding that the targets show policymakers' \"bottom-line\" thinking as they want to secure long-term, stable economic growth",
      "Chen Jia, a macroeconomic observer, told the Global Times that compared with the traditional \"GDP growth test,\" local governments will likely put more focus on achieving detailed economic targets related to people's livelihood such as employment and inflation",
      "\"China might have set its GDP target at a relatively conservative level and with more flexibility, but it will continue to urge local governments to take on the responsibility of ensuring people's livelihood,\" Tian said",
      "Tackling risksObservers stressed that although China's economy has presented promising signs in recent weeks, the country is still facing multiple headwinds ranging from external demand fluctuations to US monetary policies",
      "Zhang pointed out that this year's economic growth still faces a number of challenges, the first of which is insufficient external demand",
      "\"This year will be even tougher for the global economy, with the WTO predicting that global trade will grow by only 1 percent",
      " Therefore, although the target of 5 percent economic growth is relatively modest, some local governments may still have difficulties in achieving it",
      " This is why the Government Work Report put expanding domestic demand as the top priority of the eight major tasks in 2023,\" Zhang said",
      "Cao said that the biggest factor of uncertainty comes from changes in the external environment, such as whether some developed economies will plunge into economic recession, which will in turn drive down demand for Chinese exports",
      "The negative impact from the US' interest rate hikes might also intensify, Tian Yun said, as rate hikes are draining liquidity in the international markets",

      " Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang speaks at a forum on Tuesday, introducing China-proposed Global Security Initiative Concept Paper",
      " Photo: Chen Qingqing/GTA nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought, China announced in the Global Security Initiative Concept Paper it released on Tuesday amid growing risks and challenges that the world faces today, particularly in light of the Ukraine crisis, with the aim of eliminating the root causes of international conflicts and improving global security",
      "Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang told a forum on Tuesday in Beijing that China had officially released the Global Security Initiative Concept Paper, fully elaborating ideas and principles, clarifying cooperation mechanisms and underscoring China's responsibilities and firm determination to safeguard world peace by listing 20 major cooperation directions",
      "The paper firmly supports a UN-centered security governance structure and supports its efforts to prevent war and lead in post-war reconstruction, calling for major countries to play a leading role on global security issues, to reject hegemony and bullying and to build a peaceful coexistence, delivering stable and balanced relations between major countries, Qin said",
      "The concept paper includes several core concepts and principles including remaining committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries and abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, taking legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously",
      " It also highlighted that countries should remain committed to peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation, maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains",
      "The GSI represents a core idea underscoring a human community with a shared future, which has been welcomed and supported by over 80 countries and regions, Qin said",
      "To realize this vision, China will hold high-level GSI-related events and invite various parties to discuss security matters, which is not the privilege of a select few countries, the Chinese foreign minister said",
      "\"GSI is open and inclusive, and if any country would join the initiative and sincerely wants to safeguard world peace, we'll support that,\" Qin said",
      "As part of the concept paper, China calls on all countries to practice true multilateralism, resisting a Cold War mentality, unilateralism, bloc confrontation and hegemonism",
      " Countries should firmly uphold the consensus that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought and promote political settlement of international and regional hotspot issues",
      "\"It has been a year since the Ukraine crisis has escalated in an all-round way, and the situation has attracted international attention",
      " The Chinese side is deeply concerned about the escalating conflict and potential for developments to spiral out of control,\" Qin said",
      "Since the outbreak of the crisis, China's position has always been based on right and wrong and has abided by objectivity and fairness",
      " Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward \"four musts\", \"four commons\" and \"three points of thinking\", which have played a responsible and constructive role in easing the situation and resolving the crisis, Qin said",
      "China will continue to promote peace talks, provide Chinese wisdom for a comprehensive solution to the Ukraine issue, and work with the international community to promote dialogue and consultation to address the concerns of all parties to seek common security, Qin said",
      " At the same time, we urge relevant countries to immediately stop adding fuel to the fire, stop blaming China and stop provoking the situation by using references like \"Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow",
      "\"During the speech, Qin also noted that China's development cannot be separated from a stable international environment",
      " Similarly, without China's security, there will be no global security",
      "\"The external suppression and containment of China has been continuously escalated and intensified, posing a serious threat to China's sovereignty and security,\" he said",
      "Some attendees at the forum told the Global Times that they welcome China's proposal and that it's important to resolve global and regional issues of concern through dialogue",
      "\"Without peace, there can be no development,\" Siyabonga Cwele, Ambassador of South Africa to China, told the Global Times during the forum",
      " He noted that the world is facing many crises including the post-pandemic recovery, climate change and non-traditional security threats",
      " \"We'll support any initiative that supports sustained peace and development for common prosperity and development,\" he said",
      "The South African envoy said what impressed him the most from Qin's speech is that a major country like China is committed to rejecting hegemony and bullying",
      " \"We really hope that all developed countries can follow that path of making sure that they don't use their economic strength or military strength to coerce others,\" Cwele said",
      "Cwele also noted that China is an important player in the global affairs",
      " \"If you isolate China, or if you do not involve China",
      "",
      "",
      " there can be no sustainable peace,\" the South African diplomat said in commenting on Qin's words about \"without China's security, there will be no global security",
      "\"To achieve the global peace and multilateralism, countries should stay committed to openness and inclusiveness, which can't exclude any significant countries like China, he noted",

      "In recent years, the PLA Air Force has received lots of new equipment, with many units switching to fly advanced, domestically developed fighter jets, reaching new levels in both aircraft and pilot training, the China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Saturday",
      "At the same time, legacy equipment is being steadily decommissioned, including the J-7, the first supersonic fighter jet developed by China that can reach Mach 2",
      " This type of second-generation fighter jet was used by the PLA Air Force and the aviation force of the PLA Navy, the CCTV report said",
      "The complete decommissioning procedure of the J-7 was initiated in 2018, and units that still fly the jet will accelerate this process this year, CCTV said",

      " Lu Shaye Photo: Courtesy of Chinese Embassy in FranceEditor's Note:With the optimization and adjustment of its COVID policies, China is expected to welcome more foreign leaders in 2023",
      " Among them, French President Emmanuel Macron has expressed explicitly his willingness to visit China",
      " In recent years, China-EU relations have seen some obstacles emerging against the backdrop of the US-led strategic containment of China and the Ukraine war",
      " In an exclusive interview with Global Times reporters Chen Qingqing and Bai Yunyi (GT), Chinese Ambassador to France Lu Shaye (Lu) talked about prospects of China-EU relations as influenced by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Taiwan question, and China-France ties with the US' exertion of pressure on its major allies",
      " GT: French President Emmanuel Macron has repeatedly expressed his desire to visit China this spring",
      " If President Macron is able to make the trip, in what areas can we expect China and France to forge partnerships? In recent months, several European leaders have visited China or expressed their willingness to visit China",
      " What signal do you think this sends to the outside world?Lu: If President Macron's reported visit to China can take place, we hope that the two countries will make comprehensive plans for China-France relations and cooperation in various fields in the post-pandemic era, so as to inject new impetus into China-EU relations",
      "The cooperation between China and France has a solid foundation and covers a wide range of fields, including traditional pillar fields such as civil nuclear energy and aerospace, as well as emerging fields such as agriculture, food, new energy, medical care, sanitation, and the digital economy",
      " It is hoped that enterprises and relevant departments in the two countries will seize the opportunity and reach as many cooperation intentions as possible",
      "The current international situation is complicated and severe, and China-EU relations are under enormous pressure",
      " European leaders have visited China one after another or expressed their willingness to visit China",
      " On the one hand, it reflects China's important status in the world",
      " Engaging in ideological confrontations cannot discount the existence of China; on the other hand, this also reflects that China-EU relations are closely linked, and a depth of interest is owed to each side, which determines mutual benefit and the strong resilience of the bilateral relationship",
      "GT: Many analysts believe that there has been an ebb in China-EU relations in the last two years fraught with many difficulties",
      " What do you think is the main reason for this? Is today's China-EU relationship somewhat easing compared to the previous two years?Lu: China-EU relations have indeed encountered many difficulties in the last two years, which is regrettable",
      " I think there are several reasons for this",
      " First, the US has comprehensively increased its containment and suppression of China, coercing and luring its allies, including the EU, to take sides",
      "Especially, since the start of the Ukraine crisis, the US has tried its best to promote the rhetoric of \"democracy vs authoritarianism",
      "\" At the same time, it has engaged in anti-China propaganda and spread various rumors and lies, seriously misleading European governments and people's views on China",
      "Second, there has been a serious deviation in the EU's positioning of China",
      " The EU regards China as not only a partner, but also a competitor and an institutional opponent",
      " This reveals the opportunistic and speculative mind-set of some EU politicians",
      "Third, small EU countries like Lithuania as well as the European Parliament have made a series of deleterious moves related to China's Taiwan and Xinjiang regions, seriously damaging China's core interests, and China has had to respond accordingly",
      "Fourth, the COVID-19 pandemic has also disrupted China-EU economic and trade cooperation and cultural exchanges, deepening the gap between the two sides",
      "Despite the grim situation, we still believe that there is no fundamental conflict of interests or contradiction between China and the EU, at least geographically",
      " The two sides do not pose a security threat to each other",
      "As for ideological differences - which is the matter that Europeans like to talk about all the time - to be honest, the reality is that neither side can change the other",
      " So why can't we put it aside and not let such differences hinder the cooperation between the two sides on common interests?I think Europe should not try to \"hit China with an ideological club\" and expect cooperation in return",
      "We hope that the two sides will, in the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences and overcoming difficulties together, take the opportunity of China's optimization and adjustment of epidemic prevention and control policies to accelerate the restart of China-EU high-level exchanges, economic and trade cooperation, and people-to-people and cultural exchanges, so as to revive China-EU relations",
      "Photo: VCGGT: Do you think there is a contradiction between China developing the China-EU relations without limits and China developing the China-Russia relations with no limits, especially after the Russia-Ukraine war broke out leading to deteriorated Russia-Europe relations? Can such duality still be achieved?Lu: It is indeed a bit difficult",
      " However, we develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence",
      " If other countries are willing to abide by these five principles, I believe that our relationship with any country can be limitless",
      "At the same time, we adhere to the stance of partnership and non-alignment, and our relations with all countries neither target third parties nor are restricted by third parties",
      "Both Russia and the EU are important forces on the international stage, and both are important partners of China",
      " For us, China-Russia relations and China-EU relations can go hand in hand, and this is also the right that a sovereign state has to decide",
      "In fact, we also believe that Europe and Russia can coexist peacefully",
      " However, their relationship is really broken now",
      " We are also worried about the continued deterioration of Russia-Europe relations, because this is not good for Europe and Russia, nor for world peace and stability",
      "Therefore, we actively advocate for and support the improvement of relations between the EU and Russia, and push for them to establish a balanced, effective, and sustainable European security framework",
      " If the two sides can resolve the issue of the security framework, a long-term foundation for peace and stability in Europe can be laid",
      "GT: Are China-EU relations and China-Russia relations equally important to China? Or does it matter who comes first?Lu: From the perspective of the development of bilateral relations, China-Russia relations have developed to a historically excellent level in the last two decades, especially in the last decade",
      " Under the current complicated international situation, There are indeed more common interests between China and Russia",
      "Regarding China-EU relationship, we are also willing to develop it to a very high level, but this does not depend on the Chinese side alone",
      " It still requires the cooperation of both sides",
      " As I said before, the development of China-EU relations has not reached the level it should have been due to certain disturbances and obstacles in recent years",
      "Besides, Europe is increasingly subject to the US so its international status and influence, as well as the role it can play, are actually being greatly reduced",
      " To be honest, this is not conducive to Europe's own interests, nor to China-EU relations",
      " The above-mentioned factors have led to the actual gap between China-EU relations and China-Russia relations",
      "Photo: VCGGT: About the Taiwan question, do you think the risks around the Taiwan Straits will increase in 2023? What is the attitude of French society toward the question? During the last two years, an increasing number of European MPs have visited the island of Taiwan",
      " How will the Chinese mainland respond?Lu: The situation in the Taiwan Straits has indeed been tense in the last two years",
      " The main reason is that the US has been more provocative over the question, and it wants to provoke China to get involved in a war and interrupt the process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation",
      " The US has started a war in Europe, and it wants to start a war in Asia as well",
      " This kind of strategic intention by the US is becoming more and more obvious",
      " When I communicated with the French people, I did not hide my concern",
      "I think China's response is prudent, which reflects not only our firm will and position but also our flexible strategy and art of struggle",
      "From the actual results, what we have seen is that the continuous provocations the US has made in the last two years have given us more opportunities to increase control over the situation in the Taiwan Straits, and we have greater dominance and have shown initiative in resolving the Taiwan question",
      " Therefore, the strategic anxiety of the US is getting bigger, and with it the risk-taking intention is also on the rise",
      " We must pay close attention to this",
      "The French society is also paying greater attention to the situation in the Taiwan Straits, and the tone is basically the same as that of the US",
      " Besides, there are many ambiguous or even wrong narratives about the Taiwan question in the French public opinion, such as \"treating Taiwan as a country\" and \"comparing it to Ukraine",
      "\"I think their purpose is to create a general false impression among the public and create a public opinion environment in which we are unable to take any action regarding the Taiwan question",
      " If we want to take action, it will become a so-called aggressive act or the \"breaching of sovereignty and territorial integrity of another country",
      "\"When it comes to the visits of some European MPs including some French MPs to the island, I think those acts are aimed to hype up questions that attract public attention, using the occasion of the US' provocations to attract some attention for themselves",
      "To be honest, their visits to the island of Taiwan did not have much effect on the overall situation in the Taiwan Straits",
      "But on the other hand, the political implications of their behavior are bad",
      " They just want to create the false narrative that \"Taiwan is a country,\" a distortion of fact designed to make us ignore their ulterior motives",
      "Every time such visits occur, we negotiate with the French side and take some punitive measures against said European MPs",
      " In the future, we will continue to do so",
      " We should let Europeans and the West understand that neither the Chinese government nor the people have room for compromise on the Taiwan question",
      "GT: You often confront Western scholars and politicians in the Western media",
      " We have noticed that some Western scholars are keen on perpetuating the argument that \"China has no friends in the world",
      "\" Of course, their \"world\" mainly refers to the West",
      " Do you think China has friends in the West? For example, does China consider France as one of its friends?Lu: Some Westerners are obsessed with West-centrism",
      " They believe that the West is the world itself",
      " They habitually ignore and despise the non-Western world, which is mainly comprised of developing countries",
      " The West still has not gotten rid of the old problems of racism and racial discrimination",
      " In fact, the West has only more than 30 countries with a population of about 1 billion while the non-West has more than 160 countries and a population of 7 billion, far exceeding the West",
      "Over the years, China has established various forms of partnerships with more than 110 countries and international organizations",
      " We can say that China has friends all over the world, and the network of global partnerships is getting denser and stronger",
      "Many of our friends are also from Western countries",
      " Most Western countries and the EU have established comprehensive strategic partnerships with China, carried out fruitful and mutually beneficial cooperation, and made positive contributions to their own development and world prosperity and stability",
      "France is the first major Western country to formally establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC) [in 1964], and also the first Western country to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership with China",
      " China-France relations have long been at the forefront of China-West relations",
      "We have always considered France to be our friend in the Western world",
      " Faced with the current changes in the international situation, we hope that France will always adhere to the spirit of independence, always handle its relations with China from the perspective of strategy and guided by long-term interests, and embody the true meaning of the China-France comprehensive strategic partnership with practical actions",

      "Having held camp for several months deep in the Zangnan area, the southern part of Southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region (Tibet), a brigade of the PLA Xizang Military Command recently carried out the exercise at an altitude of 4,600 meters under the harsh cold of -20 C, theChina Central Television (CCTV) reported on Friday",
      "In the drills, multiple types of long-range rocket artillery used multiple types of munitions against multiple types of targets to test their long-range precision strike capabilities under the thin air in winter, CCTV said",

      "This brigade is a main force of long-range artillery affiliated with the PLA Xizang Military Command, and it has been constantly receiving new equipment",
      " The live-fire shooting gathered much new information, which will provide support to the integrated use of new and old equipment, CCTV reported",
      "\"After switching to use new equipment and upgrades to munitions, fire coverage between dozens to more than 100 kilometers can be done with a single system, and it can also realize multi-point precision strikes instead of suppressive fire in a large area,\" the report quoted Jiang Wei, a battalion commander of the brigade, as saying",
      "\"We can launch attacks as we go, which significantly enhances our fire strike efficiency and survivability,\" Jiang said",
      "Unlike many other types of equipment that could suffer from the lack of oxygen at high altitudes, long-range rockets work well in plateau regions as they could gain even longer ranges due to the thin air, a Chinese military expert told the Global Times on Sunday, requesting anonymity",

      "China is the only country that has repeatedly invited the WHO team of international experts to cooperate in the tracing of the origins of COVID-19 and China shares the most data and research findings on origin-tracing work, making important contributions to the global research of origin-tracing work, Mao said",
      "The US is the one who should respond to the questions and concerns from the international community about its Fort Detrick and military biological labs around the world, Mao said, noting that politicizing the issue will not smear China, but will only undermine its own credibility",

      "In footage filmed by CNN on Friday on a US P-8A reconnaissance aircraft, which took off from a US air base on the Japanese island of Okinawa, the US plane received a warning from PLA when it was about 48 kilometers from China's Xisha Islands",

      "According to CNN, the Chinese plane left when the US plane turned south",

      "The US media reports showed that the PLA has a complete and professional procedure of tracking, monitoring, escorting and driving away foreign warplanes in the South China Sea, a Chinese military expert told the Global Times on Sunday, requesting anonymity",
      "The US aircraft immediately received radio calls from the PLA when approaching Chinese airspace and was escorted by a PLA heavy fighter jet until it left, which shows that PLA radars and warplanes are always on alert to deal with any situation, the expert said",
      "The PLA Navy destroyer Changsha's interaction with the US aircraft was also powerful and professional, as the US' report also showed the PLA warship's presence in the region, the expert said",

      "Analysts said that while the US media reports aim to hype the \"China threat\" theory by attempting to depict an \"aggressive\" PLA toward the US aircraft, the truth is that it was the US spy plane that conducted a close-in reconnaissance on China at China's doorstep, and the real aggressor is the US military",
      "According to analysts, the footage shows the roots of the tension: the US makes provocative acts at other country's doorsteps and not allowing the country being threatened to make the necessary reaction",
      " \"Just another Friday\" reflected its high-intensity close-in reconnaissance in the region",
      "According to think tank reports, the US military frequently sends aircraft and vessels to the South China Sea, the East China Sea and the Taiwan Straits for close-in reconnaissance operations and provocative transits, although China is thousands of kilometers away from the US",

      "Despite some recent setbacks, experts reiterated that individual incidents will not affect the overall peaceful and stable regional situation in the sea",
      "Indonesia, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)'s chair for 2023, will hold new rounds of negotiations with ASEAN member states and China from March, as both sides have been trying for years to hammer out a COC to govern the disputed South China Sea",
      "During the close of a meeting between foreign ministers from ASEAN member states in Jakarta on Saturday, Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said that Indonesia plans to intensify talks with China and other Southeast Asian countries to finalize a COC",
      "\"New approaches\" will be explored by all ASEAN member states and Chinese counterparts to make progress on the COC, Sidharto R",
      " Suryodipuro, director of ASEAN cooperation at Indonesia's foreign ministry, said on the sidelines of the event",
      "China and ASEAN approved the framework for the COC for the South China Sea in 2017 out of the need to implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties (DOC) in the South China Sea",
      " The two sides later arrived at the single draft negotiating text later in 2018",
      " The code is expected to act as a preventive diplomatic measure and crisis management mechanism for South China Sea-related issues",
      "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, negotiations have stalled for years",
      "The new rounds of negotiations have drawn attention as experts take them as a continuation of a stable and positive trend that indicates an overall peaceful and stable situation in the South China Sea",
      " However, some others worry they may be affected by some recent setbacks between China and ASEAN member states",
      "Last week, the US managed to expand access to four additional military bases in the Philippines to boost its military flexibility in possible war scenarios with China",
      " In early January, Indonesia deployed a warship to its North Natuna Sea to monitor a Chinese coast guard vessel, claiming that it had been in Indonesia's exclusive economic zone for some time",
      "The situation in the South China Sea is mainly affected by two main factors - US interference and some related countries' priority of their own interests over regional consensus, Wang Xiaopeng, an expert in maritime and border studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "The regional situation and negotiations concerning the COC remain stable, but the US is trying to drive a wedge between China and regional countries",
      " For example, the Philippines in the latest case, so China should be prepared, Wang warned",
      "Inked in 2002, the DOC is widely viewed as the first major political document on the South China Sea issue between China and the ASEAN members",
      " In accordance with the spirit of the DOC, disputes in the South China Sea should be resolved through friendly consultation and negotiation between the countries concerned with the South China Sea, while peace and stability in the region should be jointly maintained by China and ASEAN members",
      "Article 10 of the DOC reads that \"the Parties concerned reaffirm that the adoption of a code of conduct in the South China Sea would further promote peace and stability in the region and agree to work, on the basis of consensus, towards the eventual attainment of this objective",
      "\"This means \"adoption\" of a code of conduct is the ultimate goal",
      " If negotiations on the code are left unfinished, the DOC cannot be carried out and mutual trust between China and ASEAN members will be negatively impacted, which in turn means the South China Sea will once again become an arena of major power games, analysts explained",
      "When explaining why the DOC and the COC are inseparable, Hong Liang, director general of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, stressed during an interview with the Global Times at a symposium in July 2022 commemorating the 20th anniversary of the signing of the DOC that the DOC is the foundation of the COC, without which the latter would not be possible",
      "The formulation of the COC is clearly stipulated in the DOC",
      " Therefore, the important principles and spirit contained in the DOC should be fully reflected in the formulation of the COC, Hong said",

      "Analysts said that Chinese mainland is expected to make a positive response to the KMT's visit, as opposing Taiwan secessionism plays an important role in easing cross-Taiwan Straits tensions",
      " Furthermore, the resumption and expansion of cross-Straits exchanges seems to be the inevitable trend in the post-COVID-19 era, even in the face of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities' obstruction",
      "Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said at a press briefing on Monday that the mainland is willing to strengthen exchanges with the KMT, consolidate and enhance mutual trust, and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields on the common political foundation of adhering to the 1992 Consensus and opposing Taiwan secession",
      "Joint efforts should be made to advance relations between the Communist Party of China and the KMT and relations across the Taiwan Straits, safeguard peace and stability across the Straits, and improve the interests and well-being of compatriots on both sides of the Straits, Zhu noted",
      "The KMT delegation will hold talks with Song Tao, head of the Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing, the KMT said in a statement on Monday",
      " As long as the Taiwan authorities can recognize the 1992 Consensus, which embodies the one-China principle, cross-Straits consultations and negotiations will resume, Song said at a seminar held Sunday, according to the Xinhua News Agency",
      "The KMT also claimed the visit would be an \"apolitical\" one, focusing on agricultural and fishery products, people's livelihood and other economic issues",
      " The delegation is also expected to meet with Taiwan businesspeople during trips to other mainland cities",
      "Zhang Wensheng, deputy dean of the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University, told the Global Times that the DPP's restrictions on cross-Straits exchanges and \"anti-mainland\" practices on the island caused strong discontent among the public",
      " By visiting the mainland, the KMT hopes to send a message to Taiwan society that the DPP can't ease cross-Straits tensions, while the KMT can",
      "The DPP authorities refuse to accept the one-China principle, so they have no way of communicating with the mainland, which actually gives the KMT an opportunity to make voters think about what to choose: choosing to keep cross-Strait relations tense and even dangerous, or choosing peace and stability, Zhang said",
      "Chao Chun-shan, a member of Hsia's delegation and a former top consultant of Taiwan regional leader Ma Ying-jeou, said on Monday that the KMT will \"do the right things for cross-Straits relations,\" Taiwan media reported",
      "He said that the delegation wants to convey a message that Taiwan people are not all provocative secessionists like the DPP, as they want peace, not war",
      " He also called on the DPP to hold dialogue with the mainland to reduce misunderstandings, as zero contact results in zero benefits for Taiwan",
      "\"The KMT generally recognizes the 1992 consensus, is opposed to Taiwan secession, and will play a role in easing tensions,\" said Wang Jianmin, a senior cross-Straits expert at Minnan Normal University in Fujian Province",
      "\"The mainland may give it a positive response,\" Wang told the Global Times on Monday",

      "In a 12-point position paper dubbed \"China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis,\" issued on Friday morning, the Chinese Foreign Ministry called for ceasing hostilities and resuming peace talks, stopping unilateral sanctions and abandoning the Cold War mentality",
      "It also called for respecting the sovereignty of all countries and expressed opposition to the use of nuclear weapons",
      "Chinese experts said the document should be viewed as a blueprint that has made China's principles clear for resolving the crisis and pointed out the basic path to achieve it constructively",
      "Although the document reflects China's position as a peacemaker and negotiation facilitator, as well as China's great sincerity in global governance, experts suggested that the course of the conflict largely depends on the willingness of both sides to resolve the conflict peacefully",
      " And the atmosphere and willingness to negotiate are seemingly still far from being mature given the US and NATO's interference",
      " China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis",
      " Graphic: GTA blueprint in good faithDuring the 59th Munich Security Conference in Germany last week, China's senior diplomat Wang Yi stressed that human society must not repeat the old path of antagonism, division and confrontation, and must not fall into the trap of zero-sum game, war and conflict",
      " Wang Yi said China will continue to stay firm on the side of peace and dialogue regarding the Ukraine crisis",
      "The newly released document goes further than that, a roadmap from ceasing fire to coping with the spillover crisis and promoting post-war construction, analysts said",
      "Zhang Hong, associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that the most significant highlight in the 12-point position paper is that China issued specific measures, steps and suggestions, other than just expressing its stance of promoting peace",
      "\"The Chinese document shows goodwill and sincerity, as well as its willingness to contribute to global governance,\" Zhang said",
      "The paper stressed that the international community should stay committed to the right approach of promoting talks for peace, help parties to the conflict open the door to a political settlement as soon as possible, and create conditions and platforms for the resumption of negotiation",
      "In terms of specific suggestions, the paper suggested that \"humanitarian corridors should be set up for the evacuation of civilians from conflict zones",
      "\" It also called on parties involved to avoid attacking civilians or civilian facilities, protect women, children and other victims of the conflict, and respect the basic rights of prisoners of war",
      "Against the backdrop of Russia suspending its participation in the last remaining nuclear arms control pact with the US, the paper called for keeping nuclear power plants safe and expressed opposition to the use of nuclear weapons and armed attacks against nuclear power plants or other peaceful nuclear facilities",
      "The paper also stressed the need to keep industrial and supply chains stable, mitigating the spillovers of the Ukraine crisis and preventing it from disrupting international cooperation in energy, finance, food trade and transportation and undermining the global economic recovery",
      "Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, told the Global Times that the document has made China's principles for resolving the crisis clear, offered the basic path to achieve it, as well as addressed major issues that should be of common concern to the international community",
      "\"It is a blueprint for a constructive solution to the crisis,\" Li said",
      "It would help the international community better understand China's active role as a peacemaker and facilitator of negotiations, especially when some Western media and politicians are distorting and discrediting China's role in the Ukraine crisis, Li noted",
      "The position paper also stressed promoting post-conflict reconstruction and China's constructive role in it",
      "In response to questions on the position paper, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at Friday's press briefing that China has always maintained that all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis should be supported",
      "On the basis of the position paper, China will continue to work with the international community to play a constructive role in the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, the spokesperson said",
      "The Ukraine issue has evolved in a complex historical context",
      " China has always upheld an objective and fair position to promote peace talks",
      " We have always stood firmly on the side of peace, dialogue and the right side of history, he said",
      "'Conflict benefits no one'\"The newly released document came amid a time when the US and some Western countries hype Russia's \"spring offensive\" and groundlessly accuse China of \"considering supplying arms to Russia",
      "\"In the document, China called for stopping unilateral sanctions, abandoning the Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation, as the security of a region should not be achieved by strengthening military blocs, and parties should oppose the pursuit of one's own security at the cost of others' security",
      "Besides, the paper also stressed that \"sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries must be effectively upheld",
      "\"\"Conflict and war benefit no one,\" it said",
      "However, reality does not make experts optimistic about the prospects for the talks to happen soon as the US and NATO have been clamoring for Kiev to knock Moscow down on the battlefield",
      "China's position paper takes into account the concerns of both Russia and Ukraine and is impartial",
      " But the direction of the military conflict largely depends on whether the two sides are willing to rely on outside mediators to resolve the conflict, Zhang said",
      "To some extent, America's attitude also determines the course of the war",

      "Following friendly talks which Belarus media disclosed went on \"much longer than planned,\" the two heads of state signed a joint statement on the main principles of developing exemplary relations of all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership between Belarus and China in the new era",
      "A big package of documents on cooperation in various areas was signed as part of the two heads of state's meeting, including economy and trade, industry, agriculture, customs, science and technology, health, tourism, sports and interregional cooperation",
      "Xi said China highly appreciates Belarus's firm support for China's justified position on issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and on human rights",
      "The two sides should firmly support each other's choice of development path, support each other in safeguarding respective core interests, oppose external interference in internal affairs, and protect their sovereignty and political security, Xi said",
      "The two presidents agreed to expand economic and trade cooperation, do a good job in building the China-Belarus Industrial Park, and focus on the joint building of the Belt and Road to advance cooperation in connectivity projects such as the China-Europe Railway Express service",
      "Lukashenko expressed willingness to take an active part in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Global Security Initiative and the Global Development Initiative, and would like to strengthen coordination with China on major international and regional issues",
      "Experts believe that the visit comes at an important juncture as China steps up efforts to enhance economic and international cooperation after overcoming COVID-19",
      " The meeting between Xi and Lukashenko shows that heads-of-state diplomacy plays a crucial role in the further development of China-Belarus relations in the future",
      "With the growth of bilateral ties, China and Belarus have seen a boom in trade over the past years",
      " Statistics from the General Administration of Customs of China show that two-way trade surpassed $5 billion in 2022, up by 33 percent year-on-year",
      "In the future, the two sides will further strengthen cooperation in the fields of economy, trade and diplomacy, filling the new status of bilateral relations with new content, analysts expected",
      "'Old friends'Before meeting with Xi, Lukashenko met with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang",
      " Noting the visit is his 13th to China as president, Lukashenko hailed the growth of bilateral trade, stressing that Belarus \"has no closed topics, no closed regions\" for China",
      " During the meeting with Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Zhanshu, Lukashenko said expansion of contacts with China is a foreign policy priority for Belarus, according to BelTA, the country's state-run news agency",
      "According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, upon Lukashenko's arrival, a 21-gun salute was fired in Tian'anmen Square and salutes were lined up",
      " Lukashenko, accompanied by Xi, reviewed the People's Liberation Army (PLA) honor guard",
      "Ahead of a meeting with Chinese leadership, Lukashenko laid a wreath with ribbons at the Monument to the People's Heroes on Tian'anmen Square, a rare move for another country's leader",
      "Hailing the unbreakable China-Belarus friendship, Xi stressed that the two sides should further enhance political mutual trust and remain each other's good friends and partners",
      " Meanwhile, BelTA disclosed that the two heads of states described each other as an \"old friend",
      "\"Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that China gave Lukashenko a very high level of reception",
      " In addition, Lukashenko's visit to the Monument to the People's Heroes shows Belarus's respect for Chinese history and national heroes",
      "It demonstrates the friendly relations and high political mutual trust between the two countries, Yang said",
      "Zhao Huirong, an Eastern European studies expert from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said that President Xi warmly received Lukashenko just three days before the annual two sessions are due to convene in Beijing, which shows that China attaches great importance to the friendship",
      "The documents signed by the two sides on cooperation in various fields also show the huge potential of China-Belarus cooperation in the future, Zhao said",
      "According to the joint statement, the two sides agreed to deepen comprehensive cooperation under the framework of the BRI, unleash the potential of cross-border transport such as the China-Europe Railway Express, steadily increase bilateral trade, expand direct investment and promote the high-quality development of the China-Belarus Industrial Park",
      "The two sides will cooperate in defense, judicial and other fields to jointly fight transnational crimes, terrorism and prevent color revolution",
      " They will carry out all-round cooperation within multilateral frameworks, and China supports Belarus in becoming a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization as soon as possible",
      "In the last 20 years, bilateral relations between China and Belarus improved rapidly",
      " The two countries entered a new stage of comprehensive development and strategic cooperation in 2005, and established a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2013",
      " By 2016, the pair moved to a comprehensive strategic partnership featuring mutual trust and win-win cooperation, and by 2022, an all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership was established",
      "Head-of-state diplomacy plays a decisive role, which will promote the steady and long-term development of bilateral relations and continue to move toward a higher level, Zhao said",
      "Lukashenko thanked China for its warm and friendly reception and invited Xi to visit Belarus at a time convenient to both sides",
      "Journey of peaceThe leaders' meeting also came after China issued its 12-point position paper for a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, on the first anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict",
      "In terms of the highly-anticipated discussion on the Ukraine crisis, President Xi told Lukashenko that China's core stance is to promote peace talks, abandon the Cold War mentality and build a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture",
      "Lukashenko said Belarus fully agrees with and supports China's position and proposition on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, which is of great significance for defusing the crisis",
      "In the joint statement, the two sides vowed to jointly uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core and oppose hegemony and power politics in all situations, including unilateral sanctions against other countries",
      "The two sides also expressed readiness to make efforts to avoid escalation of the crisis and restore regional peace",
      "Besides being a trip for \"old friends to meet\" and \"deepening cooperation,\" Lukashenko's visit is also a journey of peace, said Zhao Huirong, noting that as a neighbor of Ukraine and Russia, Belarus has been greatly affected by the ongoing conflict, and China's 12-point position paper is in line with Belarus' interests",
      "China and Belarus have further strengthened consensus on the Ukraine crisis through Lukashenko's trip, which is of positive significance for the parties to the conflict to sit down for talks on a political settlement at an early date, said Zhao",
      "Yet some US media outlets, which describe Belarus as Russia's \"small ally\" and smear China for allegedly considering sending Russia weapons, have used Lukashenko's visit to attempt to further bind the three nations into a bloc that needs to be defeated",
      "Some Western countries with a Cold War mentality are engaging in bloc confrontation with ulterior motives, said Yang Jin",
      "According to Yang, China has taken a neutral stance in the conflict, and has also provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine",
      " While Belarus is not a direct party to the conflict, it needs to consider its own national security and interests",
      "The expert said that the relationship between China and Belarus is already at a high level before the Ukraine crisis, which comes solely out of the mutual need for development",
      " China hopes to develop positive and healthy cooperative relations with all countries in the world for mutual benefit",
      "\"I think China's position and principles can stand the test of history and international law and order,\" Yang said",

      " In the case of Russia-Ukraine conflict, after the US acknowledged there is no evidence that China has sent lethal military support to Russia after days of relevant sensational hypes, Washington turned its spears against China's neutral stance again",
      " US National Security Council Coordinator John Kirby made a blatant call: China should satisfy the US' needs to support Ukraine in its self-defense",
      "In a recent interview, Kirby said that \"we would be happy to see steps from China to help Ukraine in terms of their self-defense,\" Sputnik News reported on Saturday",
      "This is unreasonable logic",

      " Because the longer the conflict goes on, Russia will continue to bleed, European countries will be more reliant on the US for security and NATO will maintain its unity",
      "At the end of the day, the conflict is not about a fight over territory or political systems",
      " The US wants more than simply squeezing Russia's strategic space",
      " It wants to completely trap Russia in terms of security",
      " It wants to establish a new order of European security, an order that is completely controlled by the US-led West, according to Yang",

      " The fair also dispelled criticism from the Western media which claimed China has a weak labor market, as both job-hunters, employers and officials told the Global Times on Saturday that they felt the domestic job market has rebounded a lot since this year",
      " At around 9:00 am, half an hour ahead of the recruitment fair opening, many job seekers were already lining up or making preparations for the event",
      " At 11:00 am, the Global Times saw that job-hunters were packed within the fair, with almost every stand having a long queue of people waiting to talk with Human Resources representatives",
      " Kong Lingyang, a 22-year old student at the Shanghai University of Electric Power, said that he has been seeking jobs online during the last term because of the coronavirus situation, which he described as \"searching for a needle in a haystack,\" but this year the situation has improved a lot",

      " In total, 25,000 jobs offers were made, with more than 15,000 offered to new graduates, according to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, which organized Saturday's job fair",
      "China's labor market has experienced fluctuations over the past three years because of coronavirus disruption, but signs of recovery have emerged on the market this year after the country optimized coronavirus management measures",
      " Official data showed that China held about 20,000 recruitment fairs between January 1 to February 5, with about 13 million job vacancies being advertised",
      " A number of overseas media outlets have hyped up China's unemployment situation recently, with some saying that employment anxiety is high in China",

      " \"The employment prospects for China's university graduates is definitely not that severe,\" he said",

      " \"Since the coronavirus optimization, market demands in our industry has been rising, while our production facilities are also expanding, so recruitment will also climb,\" she said",
      "Gu also revealed that her company plans to participate in about 15 offline recruitment fairs this year, compared with only about two or three during the epidemic",

      " Illustration: Liu Xidan/Global TimesThe biggest opportunity of 2023 is for Europe to take control of its own security, liberating itself from US dominance",
      " There are two aspects",
      " One is the opportunity",
      " The other is the willingness",
      "There's no doubt that Europe has an opportunity to break free of the US",
      " We are at a moment where the US is now confronted with the fact that if it is going to confront Russia in a post-Ukraine environment, it will have to radically change the nature of its engagement in Europe",
      " When the Cold War ended, the US had over 200,000 troops in Europe",
      " Today, the number has dropped considerably",
      " The infrastructure has also dropped",
      " That means the capability for the US to project meaningful military power into Europe has diminished considerably from what it was",
      "Right now, people talk about US' sending of 7,000 more troops, 5,000 troops",
      " But any military professional knows that these numbers are not impressive",
      " You can't win a conflict with such small numbers",
      " You need hundreds of thousands",
      " In order to get back into Europe in a meaningful way, the US will have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars",
      " Europe will also have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild the infrastructure and capacity that existed in the Cold War",
      " But Europe is in no position to do this",
      " They lack the economic means and the political will to do this",
      " So this is the opportunity",
      "When I want to buy a car, I may dream of a Porsche, or a Mercedes",
      " The opportunity is to have a car",
      " I have to readjust to my reality",
      "To buy the car, I can afford the car that does me the best thing, the best service",
      " Europe now is looking at the American Porsche, the American Mercedes, or if we use American term, the Cadillac, but they can't afford it",
      " The Cadillac doesn't do them any good",
      " It will bankrupt them",
      " They'll never be able to drive the Cadillac",
      " Europe needs to buy a Fiat",
      " It needs to buy a small car, one that serves it",
      "Europe needs to break away from the American dream of American dominance and security in Europe to the reality that Europe must look out for itself, must look out for its own interest",
      " Any European who reflects on what has happened the past year must realize that the US has destroyed them",
      "The US called for sanctions against Russia, and then reaped the benefits, making billions of dollars in gross profits off the sale of liquid natural gas after Europe was unable to buy unlimited quantities of Russian gas",
      " The US is taking jobs away from Europe, because European companies can no longer afford to stay in business due to high energy prices",
      "Several Western countries led by the US are sending battle tanks to Ukraine",
      " The decision to provide Western main battle tanks to Ukraine is the last gasp of a dying policy promulgated by the US to sacrifice Europe to the cause of a proxy war with Russia",
      " Europe will emerge from this experience weaker, and more firm in the knowledge that the US only cares about itself",
      " The US is not Europe's friend, it is Europe's enemy",
      "So, the opportunity exists for Europe to break free of this and create a new reality where it will be able to negotiate with Russia and others for what is best for Europe, not a Cadillac, but a small European car that meets their requirements",
      "Now the question is: Can Europe do this? The existing political and economic elites that currently dominate European politics will not allow this to happen because they came into power because of the US",
      " If they seek to do something new, the US won't support them",
      "This winter, fortunately, for the people of Europe, has been mild",
      " The energy shock, which is considerable, didn't turn into a catastrophe",
      " A catastrophe, I believe, would have led to revolutions in Europe, where people took to the streets to push out the government, as well as the ruling political and economic elites",
      "They survived this winter because of cheap Russian gas",
      " Before they cut off the supply, they were able to build up their reserves using cheap Russian gas",
      " Next year, there won't be any Russian gas for them to buy",
      " They'll have to buy expensive liquid natural gas",
      " They aren't going to be able to build up their reserves",
      " Next winter will be a catastrophe",
      "At that time, the key question for Europe is, will they go back to being little more than colonial servants of the US empire? Or will they liberate themselves and seek only the best for Europe? I can't answer that question",
      " The opportunity is there",
      " What Europe seeks to do with that opportunity is up to Europe",

      " Photo: XinhuaChina and Russia will hold a week-long joint naval drill in the East China Sea starting Wednesday, in a move which analysts said on Tuesday displays the two countries' capabilities in tackling maritime security threats and safeguarding peace and stability at a complicated time when the US keeps promoting its \"Indo-Pacific Strategy\" and Japan has broken away from its defense-only principle, instigating tensions in the Taiwan Straits",
      "Based on the annual military cooperation schedule between the Chinese and Russian armed forces, the navies of the two countries will hold theJoint Sea 2022military exercise in the waters east of the coastline stretching from Zhoushan to Taizhou, East China's Zhejiang Province from Wednesday to December 27, China's Ministry of National Defense said in a press release on Tuesday",
      "The joint exercise aims to display the two sides' determination and capability in strengthening efforts to jointly deal with maritime security threats, as well as safeguard international and regional peace and stability, and to further deepen the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era, the Chinese Defense Ministry said",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense said in a press release on Monday that the main goal of the exercise is to strengthen naval cooperation between the two countries and maintain peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region",
      "Joint naval exercises between China and Russia have become regular and routine, observers said",
      " Last year, the Joint Sea2021 was held in the Sea of Japan off the coast of Russia in waters near Peter the Great Gulf, and this year they have moved to the East China Sea off the coast of China",
      " Previously there were also drills in places like the Yellow Sea",
      "Such a rotation method will allow the Chinese and Russian navies to get familiar with each other's sea areas and achieve the best training results, Chinese military expert Song Zhongping told the Global Times on Tuesday",
      "It is an embodiment of the two militaries' mutual trust, Song said",
      "The Joint Sea2022is also not the first joint naval operation between China and Russia this year",
      " In September, after participating in the Russia-led Vostok-2022 strategic drills, a PLA Navy flotilla joined Russian warships in a joint naval patrol in the Pacific Ocean",
      " The two navies have carried out two such joint patrols since 2021",
      "The latest joint drill, set in the East China Sea neighboring the island of Taiwan and Japan, comes at a time when Japan recently revised its defense strategies, breaking away from its strictly self-defense-only postwar principle and declaring plans to possess preemptive strike capability and cruise missiles",
      "Also, Western officials have continuously visited the island of Taiwan to provoke China on its core interests after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit in August, and with the US continuing to sell arms to the island, tensions in the Taiwan Straits remain high",
      "The US Navy's Nimitz carrier strike group was set to arrive in waters northeast of Guam by Tuesday, as it is expected to start a routine deployment in the West Pacific, taking the place of the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier, according to the monitoring of the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, a Beijing-based think tank",
      "The US continues to promote its \"Indo-Pacific Strategy,\" with Japan's security strategy amendment fusing into it",
      " China and Russia are responsible for safeguarding peace and stability in the region, and that is why they must enhance military cooperation, Song said",
      "\"The China-Russia joint drill is not aimed at a third party, but if some parties want to be targeted, then let it be so,\" Song said",
      "The Chinese participating forces are from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern and Northern theater commands, including the Type 052D destroyer Baotou, the Type 052C destroyer Jinan, the Type 054A frigates Binzhou and Yancheng, the Type 903A comprehensive supply ship Gaoyouhu, as well as a submarine, fixed wing early warning aircraft, anti-submarine patrol aircraft and vessel-borne helicopters, said Senior Captain Gao Xiucheng, a spokesperson of the PLA Navy, in a statement on Tuesday",
      "According to the Russian press release, the Russian Navy will be represented by the guided missile cruiser Varyag, the frigate Marshal Shaposhnikov and the Project 20380 corvettes Hero of the Russian Federation Aldar Tsydenzhapov and Sovershennyy, as well as aircraft and helicopters of the naval aviation forces of the Russian Pacific Fleet",
      "The two naval forces will conduct exercises including joint rocket and artillery firing at air targets, artillery firing at sea targets, joint anti-submarine operations with the practical use of weapons, joint blockade and joint rescue, according to releases by the two sides",
      "These multidimensional training courses cover the core elements in modern naval combat, a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Tuesday",
      "The Varyag, which is the flagship of the Russian Pacific Fleet, and the PLA Navy's deployment of a submarine, which is supposed to be very secret, show the high level of cooperation and trust between the two navies, the expert said",
      "The two countries' warships will rendezvous at noon on Wednesday and form a joint flotilla in the East China Sea, China Central Television reported on Tuesday",
      "Joint Sea2022 marks the 10th anniversary since the first drill in this series in 2012, and it will become more realistic and innovative, promote the establishment of maritime joint patrol mechanism, and further push forward innovative, cooperative development and mutual trust between the two countries and the two navies, said Gao",
      "Simultaneous movesJust as the China-Russia joint naval drill is about to start, a large number of main combat vessels of the PLA Navy, including the aircraft carrier Liaoning and three Type 055 10,000 ton-class large destroyers, are operating beyond the first island chain in the West Pacific for apparent exercises, according to Japan's Defense Ministry, which reported the transits of those Chinese warships from the Miyako Strait and Osumi Strait last week",
      "In a move that analysts said could be a joint training operation, on Monday, two H-6J bombers of the PLA Navy flew from the East China Sea across the Miyako Strait into the West Pacific, to near the location where the Liaoning aircraft carrier group was sailing, before returning from the same course, Japan's Defense Ministry Joint Staff said in a press release on the day",
      "The PLA Navy has been growing rapidly in terms of both the number and quality of warships, as well as qualified personnel and organizational capability, so it can hold multiple large-scale military exercises concurrently, experts said",
      "It also means that in real combat, the PLA Navy can engage multiple enemies in multiple regions simultaneously, analysts said",

      " Yoon Suk-yeol Photo: XinhuaSouth Korean government is \"sleepwalking\" again",
      " In a speech yesterday on Japan-related issues, President Yoon Suk-yeol neither urged Japan to reflect on its history of aggression nor mentioned compensation for forced labor and \"comfort women\" during World War II",
      " Instead, he claimed that \"Japan has transformed itself from a militaristic aggressor of the past into a partner that shares universal values with us [South Korea]",
      "\" Yoon's speech has been fiercely criticized by South Korean public opinion and opposition parties",
      " Yesterday was the 104th anniversary of the Korean independence movement against Japan, and Yoon's speech was the most \"pro-Japanese\" among all the speeches delivered by South Korean presidents on this day",
      " The speech earned praise from Tokyo and Washington as a result",
      "The foreign policy of the Yoon administration does seem to have entered a \"sleepwalking\" state, and the continued strengthening of the US' Indo-Pacific strategy is an effective lullaby for Seoul",
      " It is worth noting that South Korean Foreign Minister Park Jin recently mentioned the Taiwan question in an interview with CNN, and his tone was very unfriendly towards Beijing",
      " He said that \"we are opposed to unilateral change of (the) status quo by force,\" and that any conflict in the Taiwan Straits could have a \"direct impact\" on South Korea",
      "Since this year, South Korea has participated in the trilateral economic security dialogue among the US, Japan, and South Korea, as well as the virtual conference of the \"Chip 4\" alliance, which is a US-led chip supply chain restructuring alliance conference of the US, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan island to promote the US' strategy of containing China's chip industry",
      " \"Friendly to Japan\" and \"distant from China\" are strategic expectations of the United States for South Korea, and regardless of what the Yoon administration says, these have become the actual direction of South Korean diplomacy",
      "The conservative faction in South Korea has found a greater sense of belonging",
      " By the way, Yoon was invited to attend the NATO summit last year",
      " However, the relationship between North Korea and South Korea has become highly tense again, and North Korea has conducted intercontinental ballistic missile tests as well as tests involving multiple rocket launcher system, which could be armed with \"tactical\" nuclear weapons for battlefield use, causing South Korea to become the \"frontline\" again",
      " South Korea's trade with China grew by 3 percent last year, reaching a record $310",
      "4 billion, but its exports to China in January this year were only $9",
      "17 billion, down 31",
      "12 percent year-on-year, with a sharp drop in chip exports",
      " Working-day shipments dropped by 15",
      "9 percent year-on-year, and semiconductor sales in January fell by 46",
      "6 percent",
      " If such a decline becomes a trend, what will be the driving force for South Korea's continued prosperity in the future?Both South Korea and Japan are US allies, so even if their relationship is bad, nothing major will happen",
      " However, Japan's refusal to reflect on its history and refusal to compensate for forced labor and apologize for the \"comfort women\" issue, means that the South Korea-Japan relationship won't get any better either",
      " In 2019, Japan imposed sanctions on South Korean crucial supplies for the semiconductor industry, using economic stick to pressure South Korea over its stance on historical issues, which caused a great humiliation for South Korea",
      "In the past, South Korea was very careful to maintain a balance between China and the United States, and as a result, it reaped huge economic benefits",
      " The trade volume between South Korea and China exceeded the total trade volume between South Korea and the United States and between South Korea and Japan",
      " Last year, exports to China accounted for 25 percent of South Korea's total exports, and 22",
      "5 percent of imports also came from China",
      "Moreover, Seoul should be well aware that while the US provides direct military protection to South Korea, China is an important force for maintaining peace on the Korean Peninsula",
      " If South Korea only embraces the US and ignores the rest, its security will be tied to the waist of the US and may even become an insole in the boots of the US, and it will lose its autonomy completely",
      "In fact, South Korea's diplomacy has always been swinging between getting close to its major neighbors and sticking closely to the US",
      " The Moon Jae-in government was a driving force in easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, while the current Yoon administration has shifted towards a different direction and resonated with the US Indo-Pacific strategy",
      " \"Pro-Japan\" is just one of the manifestations of this big swing",

      " Z-8 transport helicopters boarded on the Anhui conducted flight training, and shipborne aviation forces conducted full-process training, according to the report",
      "The Type 075 amphibious assault ship is widely believed to be a vital instrument of the PLA Navy in safeguarding China's national sovereignty, security, territorial integrity and its development interests over the Taiwan question as well as the South China Sea issue",
      " The Anhui, the PLA Navy's third ship of this type, was reported to have completed a realistic combat-oriented training in November 2022, indicating that the vessel had entered active service with the PLA Eastern Theater Command",
      "The PLA Air Force and Rocket Force also conducted their first training exercises in 2023, with the appearance of advanced weapons such as J-10C fighters and ballistic missiles",
      "With the development of new weapons and equipment in new domains and of new qualities, as well as the enhancement of joint combat capabilities as a system through realistic combat-oriented exercises, the PLA will become increasingly capable of safeguarding national sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests amid future uncertainties, observers noted",
      "Observers view the reports of the PLA's busy New Year training as a continuation of a busy year of missions and development in 2022, following several concurrent major military exercises at the end of 2022, including the China-Russia joint naval drill, far sea training of the Liaoning aircraft carrier group, and the cross-service joint exercises around the island of Taiwan",
      "According to media based in Taiwan island, in 2022, the PLA sent 1,727 aircraft into the island's air space, nearly double that of 2021",
      "Entering 2023, experts expect the PLA to continue to enhance integrated combat and rapid reaction capacity considering the security challenges facing China",
      "The traditional security threats facing China mainly come from the Taiwan Straits and the surrounding water areas of Taiwan island, and the southwestern border, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Wednesday",
      "Song also warned of military provocations brought by Western countries led by the US over the abovementioned issues",
      "In order to deal with these threats, the PLA needs to strengthen its joint combat and rapid response capability as well as cross-sea combat capability, Song noted",
      "The PLA has to obtain the capacities to win control of the air, sea, space and the electromagnetic net in order to win the hybrid warfare of the future, according to Song",

      " The Pentagon seen from an airplane over Washington DC",
      " Photo: XinhuaEditor's Note:The Russia-Ukraine conflict is approaching its one-year mark, with no end in sight",
      " It is eating up scarce European resources, preventing millions of refugees from returning home and weakening the global economic outlook while the US and some European countries are fanning the flames of the war, keeping sending weapons to Ukraine",
      " How will the Russia-Ukraine conflict end? What are the biggest stumbling blocks for negotiation and diplomatic resolution?In an interview with Global Times (GT) reporter Yu Jincui, Brian Berletic (Berletic), a geopolitical analyst and a former solider of US Marine Corps, said the biggest obstacle to any diplomatic solution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict is that Russia is fighting the US and its allies which are waging a proxy war via Ukraine",
      " \"The US now seeks to extend this proxy war for as long as possible with a desire to raise the cost for Russia as much as possible,\" he noted",
      "This is the third installment of the series",
      "GT: What is the biggest obstacle to a diplomatic solution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict?Berletic: The biggest obstacle to any diplomatic solution is that Russia is not actually fighting \"Ukraine,\" but instead is fighting the US and its allies which are waging a proxy war via Ukraine",
      " Any sort of diplomatic solution will have to first recognize then rectify the threat the US poses to Russian national security through NATO's constant eastward expansion and its militarization and radicalization of nations bordering the Russian Federation",
      "Unfortunately for Ukraine, it is not a matter of what the population or even what the government in Kiev wants, but instead what Washington wants",
      " Since the special interests in Washington driving this foreign policy are not the ones paying in either treasure or blood for the cost of this proxy conflict, there is little motivation at the moment for Washington to recognize or rectify Moscow's legitimate national security concerns",
      "GT: Weapons for Ukraine have topped the agenda at Munich Security Conference",
      " There are voices calling for more and better weapons for Ukraine",
      " Countries including the US, Germany and UK recently pledged to send main battle tanks to Ukraine",
      " What's your take on this? What role will the weapons provided by the West play in Ukraine?Berletic: Sophisticated heavy weapons like main battle tanks take years for a nation's military to integrate into their armed forces",
      " This is because these weapon systems require demanding logistical, training, and doctrinal inputs that take time, energy, and resources to put in place",
      " Ukraine has neither the time nor the infrastructure to practically or effectively use these tanks on the battlefield",
      "Main battle tanks are only one part of combined arms warfare which necessitates their use alongside mechanized infantry, artillery and air power",
      " Ukraine lacks sufficient numbers of both trained mechanized infantry and artillery and has little to no air power at all",
      "There is also the fact that the tanks pledged to Ukraine including Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 tanks, as well as Challenger 2 and M1A2 Abrams tanks, even with combined arms support, have already faced modern warfare and have proven to be no more effective than the modernized Soviet-era tanks Ukraine began with in late February of 2022",
      "Ukraine began the special military operation with around 1,000 tanks of their own",
      " Eastern European NATO members then transferred hundreds of their Soviet-legacy tanks to Ukraine, including those modernized since the end of the Cold War",
      " The majority of these tanks have been destroyed, including hundreds during the Kherson offensive",
      " What may be up to 300 additional tanks, a mix between Western and remaining Soviet-era tanks in NATO's inventory, will simply prolong the conflict, not change the outcome",
      "GT: US President Joe Biden has ruled out providing F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine",
      " To what extent will the US support Ukraine in its conflict with Russia?Berletic: US President Joe Biden has ruled out F-16 fighter jets",
      " But he had previously ruled out tanks, then decided to send them eventually anyway",
      " Russia should assume that eventually the US, and the rest of NATO will send all forms of weaponry, including long-range ATACMS missiles",
      "The likelihood of the West prevailing in Ukraine is negligible",
      " The objective is to make Russia's success as costly as possible",
      " The only prospect Ukraine has of \"winning,\" defined as taking back all territory Kiev considers Ukrainian, is if NATO itself intervenes directly",
      " Even then, it is questionable whether or not this maximalist objective can be achieved or some sort of stalemate arrived at instead",
      "GT: There is a view that the US is the biggest initiator of the war in Ukraine, and that the US will prevent the war from ending in order to profit from the protracted conflict",
      " What do you think of this?Berletic: The US most certainly triggered Ukraine's current war",
      " We have to remember that the war didn't begin in February 2022",
      " Russia was merely intervening in the middle of an ongoing war that began in 2014 when the US openly overthrew the elected government of Ukraine",
      " The US then began militarizing and even \"NATO-izing\" Ukraine, right on Russia's border",
      "Policy papers like the 2019 RAND Corporation document, \"Extending Russia,\" openly noted that such a policy would present Moscow with a sufficient threat to its national security which would compel it to act and thus \"extend\" Russia economically and militarily as it did so",
      " Policy papers and comments made by American leadership indicate that this was a premeditated provocation aimed at forcing Russia into a costly proxy war",
      "The US now seeks to extend this proxy war for as long as possible with a desire to raise the cost for Russia as much as possible",
      "GT: US mainstream media are propagating their own selective facts and myths, while censoring counterclaims when reporting on the Ukraine war",
      " Given your understanding of how US mainstream media function, is it in your expectation? One year on, how does it affect the American people's perception of the war? Will anti-war voices increase in the US in future?Berletic: The collective West has invested significantly in controlling public perception regarding the conflict in Ukraine",
      " The West has committed to censoring both Russian media and Western media presenting alternative perspectives",
      " In this controlled information space, the Western media has created an alternative reality where the Russian military is incompetent and on the retreat, and Ukraine is expertly fighting their way toward victory",
      "As this fantasy now collides head-on with reality, much of the Western public finds itself in shock which manifests itself in some cases through disillusionment, but to a greater extent, hysteria and desperation",
      " This desperation is also spreading across Western political circles and increasingly dangerous \"solutions\" are being explored to \"turn the tide\" and \"change the game\" we had been told all along was working in Ukraine's favor",
      "Anti-war voices (in the sense of being opposed to Washington's proxy war) are growing in number and reach, owed in part to the increasingly multipolar nature of geopolitics",
      "GT: To what extent do you think NATO will directly engage in the Russia-Ukraine war? Some say that NATO's full involvement will trigger World War III",
      " What do you think?Berletic: There are a variety of ways NATO can intervene more directly in Ukraine",
      "First, NATO could attempt to establish a buffer zone in western Ukraine similar to what the US and Turkey did in northern and eastern Syria",
      " Because the US was able to manage escalation with Russia in Syria, Washington may be tempted to try it again in Ukraine, preventing the entire collapse and defeat of Ukraine and freezing the conflict to a certain extent just as the US did in Syria",
      "Another possibility is for the US to encourage nations like Poland and the Baltic states to not only cross into Ukraine and establish control over western Ukraine, but send forces officially or unofficially to the front lines alongside what is left of Ukrainian forces",
      "In both scenarios the lines of communication between Poland where the vast majority of Ukrainian logistics originate and where most of its maintenance facilities are located, and the front line will be significantly shortened, but only if Russia were to refrain from targeting logistics and maintenance facilities established in any sort of buffer zone",
      "The entire prospect is incredibly risky in terms of escalation, but even if WWIII is avoided, there is no guarantee that such a risky move would improve Ukraine's prospects over the long term",
      " We see US forces in Syria under increasing pressure to withdraw and Turkey slowly but surely pivoting away from Washington and more willing to resolve the conflict in a mutually beneficial way between itself, Moscow, and Damascus",
      " A similar long-term chain of events may play out in Ukraine",
      "GT: NATO's chief hyped that China is closely watching the Ukraine war and learning lessons that may influence its future decision toward the Taiwan question",
      " US military generals have also been hyping that China and the US will go to war in 2025 over the Taiwan question",
      " Why have some Western political figures concocted the narrative \"today's Ukraine is tomorrow's Taiwan?\" Why does the US military keep hyping up the war over Taiwan?Berletic: The US is linking Ukraine to Taiwan not because Russia and China are both belligerent nations pursuing a similar, aggressive policy, but because both Ukraine and the Taiwan island play key roles in Washington's ambitions to encircle and contain both Russia and China in an attempt to eliminate them as peer or near-peer rivals",
      "Just as the US created a national security threat in Ukraine to provoke Moscow, the US is doing likewise in the Taiwan island to provoke Beijing",
      "Washington is well aware that within the current status quo peaceful reunification between Taiwan and the rest of China is inevitable",
      " While there is no prospect for Washington to create an \"independent\" Taiwan, the US seeks to make reunification as costly and as bitter as possible for China",
      " It is not that China is in any rush for conflict by 2025, but instead it is between 2025-2030 when the window of opportunity closes entirely on any prospect of the US waging war on China and achieving a favorable outcome",
      "The US must create the conditions for war over Taiwan now, while the economic and military disparity between China and the US is still narrowing, or accept a peaceful reunification of Taiwan with the rest of China as disparity begins to grow economically and militarily between China and the US in Beijing's favor",

      " Illustration: Liu Xidan/GTPresident Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasised since 2017 that the world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century",
      " In July 2022, then state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi noted that this perspective had been fully confirmed due to recent events",
      " And the trend is deepening",
      "The world today is simultaneously experiencing international economic slowdown, the aftermath of a global pandemic, a major war in Ukraine involving nuclear armed powers in NATO and Russia, and a path of climate change which, while some countries have achieved progress, actions by others currently means that the planet will not stay within boundaries of global warming",
      "As a result, in addition to military conflict, which is the \"traditional\" threat to global security, many \"non-traditional\" threats have also developed - the consequences of economic slowdown, pandemics, climate change, terrorism, risks to adequate water supply in some areas of the world, the threat of large-scale population movements attempting to escape consequences of these developments",
      "The key conclusion flowing from this situation is that the framework of \"a human community with a shared future,\" put forward by Xi, which forms the strategic basis of China's foreign policy, is fundamental for dealing with security challenges of both \"traditional\" and \"non-traditional\" types",
      " It is therefore crucial that this framework is as widely understood internationally as possible",
      " Opportunities to achieve this are increasing because a rising number of people and countries do not wish to participate in processes which worsen the global and their own situation - as recent events confirm",
      " They wish to pursue a collaborative course, of which Xi's concept is the most coherent expression and which, as will be seen, can be applied to countries with different political systems",
      "Because Xi's concept is so important and because I am an economist, I will concentrate on the economic basis of this",
      "The history of humanity's development is that of its increasing interaction",
      " Humanity started in families and small tribal groups, then formed states, empires and eventually the entire world",
      "The force driving this was pointed out by both Adam Smith, founder of Western economics, and Karl Marx, founder of socialist economics",
      " Division of labour, Smith's terminology, socialisation of labour, Marx's terminology for the same development, means that via social production humans produce far more, and achieve a vastly higher standard of life, than any individual",
      " Furthermore, different countries have different advantages in production, therefore by cooperating they can be far more productive than a single country",
      "But this has another implication",
      " The advantage comes from countries being different, not identical",
      " These differences inevitably give rise to different social and political systems",
      "But regardless of different social and political systems countries face numerous common global problems, including \"non-traditional\" ones that can best or only be solved by collective action",
      "This fact determines the forms of successful international cooperation",
      " As countries are necessarily different, they must co-exist on the basis of multilateralism, of accepting the inevitability of these differences, without one country attempting to impose its demands and system on the others - any attempt to do that will necessarily create damage",
      "To illustrate international organizations which implement these principles successfully, take developing Asian countries, and successful organizations they have created to deal with common problems",
      "ASEAN contains countries with diverse political systems - socialist in China, monarchy in Thailand, numerous republics",
      "Or take the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which contains a socialist country China, an Islamic republic Iran, and numerous non-religious republics",
      "What has made these organizations successful is that they do not attempt to impose political uniformity nor are they military alliances to deal with traditional security threats",
      " The majority of issues they face are \"non-traditional",
      "\" These include:Terrorism - one of the key threats to SCO countries was from jihadist terrorism that spread widely in Middle East after the US destabilized the region through the invasion of Iraq",
      " Cooperation in the SCO considerably aided the struggle against the spread of such terrorism",
      "Economic development - ASEAN is the world's most rapidly economically growing regional group of countries",
      " This in turn helped maintain stability in all countries in the region",
      "Climate change - many Asian developing countries are particularly at risk from this, as recent heat waves in China and devastating floods in Pakistan confirm",
      " Countries in the region are cooperating to face this common threat",
      "This very successful cooperation against numerous \"non-traditional\" security threats takes place with no attempt to impose a uniform political system or a single military alliance",
      "Contrast the instability the US approach has created not only in the Middle East but now in Europe",
      " Throughout most of Europe, the US has created a single military alliance - NATO",
      " It has supported a single political system, a secular parliamentary or presidential one",
      " What has accompanied this is the biggest chaos in Europe since World War II - the highest inflation for 40 years, declining living standards and a major war",
      "The conclusion for successful international cooperation is clear",
      " There should not be attempts to create a single model, countries should cooperate to meet common threats, whether \"traditional\" or \"non-traditional,\" accepting different national political systems and not attempting to interfere in these",

      "Wang revealed that China is developing a next-generation manned launch vehicle that will meet the long-term strategic need for manned lunar exploration",
      " It will be capable of sending payloads of 70 tons into near-Earth orbit, and is expected to make its maiden flight by 2027",
      "It will be used to send a lunar surface lander and lunar landing spacecraft to the Lunar Transfer Orbit (LTO) using liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen and kerosene propellants, capable of carrying payloads of no less than 27 tons to the LTO",
      "It will serve as an important strategic support to realize China's manned landing on the moon by 2030",
      "Rong disclosed that a new-generation manned spacecraft and a moon lander are being developed",
      " The spacecraft will be able to accommodate three astronauts to the LTO and return them to Earth, while the lander could allow two people to carry out scientific experiments on the lunar surface",
      "The Earth-Moon space has become a new territory of manned activities in space for its rich material resources and unique environmental resources, which could become a new pillar of the national economy in the future as well as the \"best sample\" for studying the origin and evolution of the Earth",

      " It really didn't take me long to understand much of it was wrong; probably about 24 hours",
      "What I was seeing in real life didn't matter at that time because my media consumption was telling me China was slowing, China was collapsing, China was a bad place to be and it must have been true because even the BBC, CNN and other western media platforms said so",

Go look it up, it's true",

      " Many Germans participate in a demonstration and rally for the peaceful settlement of the Russia-Ukraine conflict which called for \"negotiations with Russia instead of arms deliveries for Ukraine\" at the Brandenburg Gate, Berlin on February 25, 2023",
      " Photo: VCGWestern countries' latest round of isolation of and sanctions against Russia further dim the prospect of peace talks, and will only lead to more bloodshed, more sacrifice during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and more property loss worldwide, said Chinese experts after Western countries attempted to frame a statement condemning Moscow at the G20 gathering, and the EU slapped a new round of sanctions against Russia",
      " In order to provide a solution for the current deadlock, China on Friday unveiled a peace plan on solving the crisis",
      " The plan, although widely welcomed by relevant parties, was smeared by the US as \"not rational",
      "\" Experts believe the groundless accusations exposed the US' selfish desire of not wanting the conflict to end, and its attempt to dwarf China's influence on negotiating global affairs",
      " In a two-day gathering of G20 finance ministers in Bengaluru, India, which ended on Saturday, some members were plotting to sign a joint communiqu\u00e9 to denounce Russia on its conflict with Ukraine",
      " But the effort failed due to opposition from Russia and China, and India also shied away from making a clear point whether to join the condemnation, media reported",
      "Meanwhile, The EU and some Western countries, including the US and the UK, slapped a new round of sanctions against Russia in the nick of time on Friday, including further export bans worth more than $11",
      "6 billion, sanctions on about 120 Russian individuals and entities and a new reporting obligation on Russian Central Bank assets, according to a document published by the EU on Saturday",
      " The slew of sanctions are anticipated to have very limited impact on Russia",
      " \"They are just diplomatic and symbolic gestures from the Western countries to vent out their frustrations,\" said Li Ziguo, a senior research fellow with the China Institute of International Studies",
      " Western nations have already exhausted their repertoire of sanctions against Russia, including sanctions on Russia's crude oil and natural gas",
      " \"The decoupling of energy and trade between Russia and Europe and the US was long formed after the first rounds of sanctions,\" Li noted",
      " Russia, on the other hand, is also working out ways to offset the impact of West's sanctions, said Li",
      " Russia's economy contracted by 2",
      "1 percent in 2022, the federal statistics service said on Feburary 20, shrinking less than anticipated despite the sanctions",
      "Further isolating Russia on the international stage and slapping sanctions have only made prospects of peace talks or using political means to solve the conflict dim, Zhang Hong, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times",
      "\"Such impulse actions may help Western countries vent out their frustration and feel better for a minute, but it will cause more bloodshed, more sacrifice and bigger property loss as it further fuels the conflict,\" said Zhang",
      "Several hundred protesters gather for an anti-war demonstration to oppose US military aid to Ukraine in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC on February 19, 2023",
      " The rally's organizers and speakers also called for the Pentagon's budget to be slashed and NATO to be disbanded",

      " Russia welcomed on Friday China's 12-point proposal, and Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zakharova said in a statement that \"with regard to the Ukraine crisis, Russia is open to achieving the goals of the special military operation by political and diplomatic means",
      "\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was open to considering some aspects of the plan, US media Politico reported on Saturday",

      " He was quoted by AFP as saying that \"the fact that China is engaging in peace efforts is a good thing",
      "\"US President Joe Biden appeared to be one of the rare saboteurs of China's peace plan",
      " In an interview with ABC on Friday, the US president said that \"the idea that China is going to be negotiating the outcome of a war that's a totally unjust war for Ukraine is just not rational",
      "\"The Chinese plan advocates peace, while what the US wants is the conflict to be dragged on as it fits Washington's interest, so naturally Biden would throw mud at the Chinese plan, said Zhang",
      " Another reason, according to Zhang, is that the US wants to dwarf China's influence on negotiating important international affairs",
      "The Pentagon announced a new package of long-term security assistance for Ukraine on Friday, marking the first anniversary of conflict with a $2 billion commitment to send more rounds of ammunition and a variety of small, high-tech drones into the fight, the Associated Press reported",
      "According to a report published by CNN in January 2023, the US and its allies have already sent nearly $50 billion in aid and equipment to Ukraine's military over the past year, and that Ukraine is burning through ammunition faster than the US and NATO can produce it",
      "The arms aid from the West proved futile to change the status quo of the conflict during the past year, and on the contrary, only fueled the crisis, said Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University",
      " \"The current deadlock proved that China's plan of sitting relevant parties down for peace talk is a more feasible way of walking out of the quagmire,\" Li told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "China's rational, balanced and selfless plan, issued at a time when the US-led West is about to push the conflict to a more perilous situation, brings light of peace for the current deadlock, and injects much needed rationality for the deadlock, Li noted",

      "This report claims that it is \"based on a survey of journalists who belong to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China",
      "\" In fact, the FCCC is an illegal organization that China has never recognized",
      " The organization's members are made up of less than half of all foreign journalists stationed in China and are essentially a small circle of journalists from several European countries and the US with a bias against China",
      " What credibility can this so-called investigative report by such an organization have? All it does shows the strong ideological prejudice and malicious smearing from this illegal organization against China",
      "This is not the first time that the FCCC has issued statements or reports criticizing environment for reporting and press freedom in China",
      " The organization is used to distorting facts, and discrediting and smearing China's reporting environment, and has a notorious record in this regard",
      " Instead of talking about the massive help and convenience that China provides for foreign journalists in their work, or criticizing individual foreign media for inaccurate and distorted reporting, the organization indiscriminately blames the so-called working conditions in China, which is completely disregarding right and wrong and confusing black and white",
      "Any journalist who sets foot on Chinese territory should abide by Chinese laws",
      " This is a basic principle of international communication",
      " The FCCC's smearing of China is an illegal, impolite, and inappropriate act",

      " As a matter of fact, some illegal organizations and associations in the West are not independent, but tools and advance teams sent to contain China, in a bid to serve the diplomatic goals of the US and some Western countries",
      " In this regard, we need to be highly vigilant",
      "In fact, compared with the US and the West, China is quite tolerant of legal and compliant journalists in China",
      " Even some journalists who smear China are allowed to come to China to conduct interviews",
      " However, instead of being grateful, they always view China's development and reality in an arrogant manner",

      " Notably, in recent years, they have beefed up their attempts to suppress media, especially those from China and Russia",
      " For example, the US has treated some Chinese media as \"foreign agents\" or \"foreign missions,\" and in March 2020, the US government announced the expulsion of 60 Chinese journalists",
      " China's CGTN was unjustly suppressed politically in the UK, and had its broadcasting license revoked there",
      "The US and some Western countries are rude, arrogant, and value-oriented toward countries with different ideologies, especially China",
      " Washington is increasingly concerned about losing its hegemony and is becoming more hostile toward China",
      " Furthermore, the elites in the US and some Western countries are becoming more deceptive",
      " They are worried that their people will see the real China",
      " After all, China represents a force of progress that serves the people",
      "The practice of the US and some Western countries when it comes to Chinese and Russian media reveals their double standards and indicates the collapse of their so-called press freedom",
      "The West does not have absolute freedom of the press, only freedom of the press that represents the interests of the ruling class",
      " Those who oppose this principle will be banned",
      " Previously, Western governments could intervene in journalism in a more subtle manner",
      " But today, in the context of the relative decline of the West, they have begun to interfere more directly and rudely",
      " The goal is to maintain the interests of their ruling class, especially in terms of ideological domination",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in 2021, \"We [China] always welcome media and journalists from other countries to do their work in China in accordance with laws and regulations, and will continue to provide convenience and assistance",
      " What we oppose is ideological bias against China, fake news under the cover of freedom of the press, and violation of professional ethics",

      " Some Western media's false reporting has triggered dissatisfaction and indignation among the Chinese people",

      " A medical worker talks with the relatives of a patient at the emergency department of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University in Hefei, east China's Anhui Province, Jan",

      " (Xinhua/Zhou Mu)A number of Chinese localities, including Central China's Hubei, Southwest China's Sichuan and Northeast China's Heilongjiang, are implementing a reform of health insurance for urban employees and retirees, drawing widespread attention",
      "Industry observers said the reform, which reduces the amount deposited each month into personal accounts, doesn't mean the reduction or loss of health insurance benefits, nor is it a move to cover COVID-19-related expenses, as some Western media asserted",
      "The health insurance reform is a decision that has been made after years of discussion, planning and prudent consideration and places Chinese families in a better position to cope with medical risks, and elderly people who are more susceptible to illness and incur higher medical expenses will benefit the most from the reform, observers said",
      "Wang Chaoqun, associate professor from Department of Labor and Social Security at Central China Normal University, told the Global Times on Sunday that under the new plan, the reform can reimburse outpatient bills and alleviate the financial burdens of the insured, especially elderly people or those who often visit doctors and find it is not enough to pay for their expenses",
      "Previously, the money within personal accounts was far from sufficient in covering medical costs in hospitals and pharmacies",
      " Data showed that in a metropolis where about 5 million people had joined the medical insurance system, less than 5 percent of personal accounts had balances of more than 10,000 yuan ($1456), and fewer than 1 percent had balances of more than 20,000 yuan, Wang noted",
      "The threshold for the reimbursement percentage of outpatient medical bills is 50 percent, and in some cities such as Xiamen, a city in East China's Fujian Province, the level can reach as high as 98 percent, according to Wang",
      "For those who rarely see doctors and have tens of thousands of yuan sleeping in their accounts, the reform will feel like a loss in the short term, but when they get older or if they become sick and need to see doctors frequently, they will eventually find that they benefit from the reform, Wang said",
      "China's health insurance system for urban employees and retirees consists of two parts: mandatory personal accounts with contributions from both employees and their employers that mainly pay for ordinary outpatient services; and a pooled fund contributed by employers that is used to reimburse hospitalization bills, outpatient bills for serious diseases, and expenses for some chronic diseases, according to the Xinhua News Agency",
      "After the reform, money deposited by employers into employees' personal accounts will be directly paid to the pooled fund in order to support the reimbursement of ordinary outpatient medical bills",
      " The reform was officially rolled out by the State Council in April 2021",
      "Some Western media have deliberately linked the reform of the health insuranceto COVID-19 and asserted that the reform is trying to allocate money from personal accounts to make up the deficit of the medical insurance fund",
      "Their claims are made only to smear China and lack foundation, experts said",
      " The pooled fund has made ends meet over the years, Jin Weigang, a professor at Zhejiang University, told the Global Times",
      "The total revenue of China's basic medical insurance funds in 2021 reached 2",
      "8 trillion yuan (around $439",
      "7 billion) and the expenditure was 2",
      "4 trillion yuan, according to the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA)",
      "The reform is a decision that was made after years of discussion and in 2010, the Social Security Law laid a legal ground for the health reform, Wang noted, refuting any link between COVID-19 and the reform",
      "During the COVID-19 epidemic, fees for vaccines and nucleic acid testing were financed by the state, and some COVID-19 treatments and drugs were covered by the health insurance fund because it fit the reimbursement policy, Wang noted",
      "Compared with other countries, the benefits of China's health system are obvious",
      " China has built a national basic medical insurance system covering over 1",
      "36 billion people, accounting for over 95 percent of the entire population",
      " It is a mission hardly imagined for a developing country",
      "But in the US, before Obamacare, as much as about 30 or 40 million Americans were uninsured and numerous studies have shown that the first cause for people to go bankrupt in the US is the extreme high cost of medical care, observers noted",

      "The potential US arms sale to the island of Taiwan come at a time when the US has been hyping the possibility that China could send military aid to Russia, but in reality, it is the US and its NATO allies that have been sending military aid to Ukraine over the past year, while claiming today's Ukraine could be the island of Taiwan's tomorrow in a move to disrupt the security situation in the Asia-Pacific region",
      "China has not sent military aid to either Russia or Ukraine because the country has been adhering to promoting peace and political solutions through discussions",

      "The US wants to diversify its military deployment to facilitate its \"distributed warfare\" through partnerships with regional countries, but the Philippines, despite its willingness to enhance security ties with the US, is managing a fine line to avoid getting involved in the US-China confrontation, according to military analysts",

      " to open four more US military sites at Philippine bases under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA)",
      "One of the bases is located in Luzon Island close to China's island of Taiwan and another located in Palawan, which was visited by US Vice President Kamala Harris last November and is close to China's Nansha Islands",
      "The US Marine Corps on January 26 officially opened its first new base on island of Guam, and in early January, while Japan approved a new US Marine quick-reaction force on Okinawa",
      "The US is seeking to deploy more on the second island chain while maintaining capabilities on the first island chain, Zhang Xuefeng, a Chinese mainland military expert told the Global Times",
      " He explained that the US hopes that increasing accessible bases in Philippines can block the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) within the first island chain or at least thwart PLA operations",
      "The US wants to increase operational flexibility in the scenario of a war by expanding access to foreign bases, but the host country should be cautious of being used as a \"shield\" for Washington's belligerence, Zhang said",
      "Xu Liping, director of the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, saw the move as more symbolic than of practical significance, because US operations in those Philippine bases would be very limited",
      "An EDCA allows US access to Philippine bases for joint training, pre-positioning of equipment and building of facilities such as runways, fuel storage and military housing, but not a permanent presence",
      "Analysts also noted strong opposition among local civilian populations against increased US deployments",

      " The two countries also recently agreed to conduct more than 500 activities together throughout the year",
      "The Philippines looks forward to enhancing defense capabilities, Xu said, but the country also has a clear mind on how to manage relationship with China and US, and its priority lies in economic development, infrastructure and living standards, where China is playing a key role among all its regional partners",
      "The EDCA was revived after Marcos took office, but the president has also expressed great hope, confidence and determination to further develop bilateral relations to a higher level in a friendly atmosphere during his state visit to China in January",
      "During the visit, China and the Philippines signed a slate of cooperation agreements and announced the resumption of negotiation on joint oil and gas cooperation",
      "Should the US-Philippine agreement be finalized, Xu predicted the US will herald it as major progress in its Indo-Pacific Strategy targeting China, while the Philippines would be very careful in its use of rhetoric, being reluctant to impact China-Philippine relations",
      "It is difficult for the Philippines to satisfy all parties against the backdrop of escalating China-US confrontation, but Chinese analysts reminded the future of the Philippines lies in the Asia-Pacific region, not as Washington's cannon fodder",

      " Photo: AFPThe US' handling of an astray Chinese airship was \"hysterical, abused force\" and apparently violated international norms and conventions, senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi said on Saturday when taking questions at a session of the ongoing Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Germany",
      "On a trip to Europe, Wang, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, has visited France and Italy, and will depart for Hungary and Russia after attending the MSC",
      "Wang, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said the \"balloon\" was a civilian unmanned airship, which was blown into US airspace due to a strong westerly wind",
      " We requested the US to handle it calmly, professionally through communication with China",
      " \"Regretfully, the US disregarded those facts, deployed advanced fighter jets and shot down a 'balloon' with missiles,\" Wang said",
      "\"Such action is absurd, hysterical and pure abuse of military force",
      "\" It is an apparent violation of international norms, in particular the principle of the Chicago Convention, or the Convention on International Civil Aviation",
      "China definitely cannot accept that, and lodged strong protests to the US",
      "There are numerous balloons floating around the Earth, belonging to different countries",
      " Will the US shoot all of them down? Wang challenged",
      "The US action did not prove its strength, but achieved only the opposite, the senior diplomat stressed",
      "\"We advise the US to stop doing such ridiculous things out of domestic political calculation",
      " We also urge the US to show sincerity, correct its mistake, and face up to and address its damages to China-US relations,\" Wang said",
      "In response to how such an isolated, unexpected incident could trigger such a farce, Wang attributed it to the US' erroneous perception and strategic misjudgment of China",
      "China's US policy is clear and transparent, that is mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation",
      " On the back of these principles, China is willing to work with the US to jointly explore how major powers of different systems can coexist with each other",
      " However, the US response is China constitutes a severe \"geopolitical challenge,\" a \"long-term competitor\" and even a \"threat",
      "\"Built on an incorrect perception of China, the US is using all means to crack down on China and coerce other countries to follow suit, Wang continued",
      "The US claimed it is \"competing with China",
      "\" China never fears competition, but it must be fair and rule-based",
      " But what did the US do?Wang cited the US' CHIPS and Science Act, blasting it as pure protectionism, selfishness and unilateralism, which seriously breached the principle of free trade and the rules of the WTO",
      "It is an irony of history that the US stands opposed to the free trade it has long advocated",
      "",
      "",
      " The US has torn apart its disguise in attempt to blatantly plunder, Wang said",
      "The modernization of China as a country of 1",
      "4 billion population should be heralded as huge progress for mankind, why should the US seek to hinder it? Wang asked",
      "The senior Chinese diplomat said that China hopes the US will revert to a pragmatic China policy, and work with China to bring bilateral relations back on a normal track, which not only is in line with the interests of the two peoples but also meets the universal expectation of the international community",
      "During Wang's earlier meeting with Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on the sidelines of the MSC, the senior Chinese diplomat also referenced the balloon crisis, saying that the event shows the US' prejudice and ignorance of China has reached an absurd level",
      "In his speech, Wang also touched on the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " He revealed that China will soon release a document detailing its stance on a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis",
      "China does not seek to fuel the crisis, or to profit from the crisis",

      "1 million civilians were killed, according to Japan's Kyodo News agency",

      "\" The declaration reveals the bias and arrogance of the EU and NATO toward the perception of China, which China strongly opposes, a spokesperson for the Chinese mission to the EU said on the same day",
      "China is firmly opposed to the unreasonable accusations and cold war mentality against China in the joint declaration, said the Chinese spokesperson on Tuesday",
      "At present, the world is facing many serious challenges, and it is only right to put aside geopolitical and ideological obsessions and work together to address them",

      "Tuesday's declaration is the third joint declaration between the two sides after 2016 and 2018",

      "With the Russia-Ukraine conflict at a stalemate, the West seems to be strengthening NATO's influence in Europe by adopting such a joint declaration that would actually immobilize this relationship between NATO and the EU, he said",
      "Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times that NATO, as a military bloc left over from the Cold War, always holds a clear attitude toward Russia and China",
      "\"However, with the recent visit of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to China and the possible visit of French President Emmanuel Macron, NATO is worried about the change in the EU's attitude, so it hopes to regulate the EU's behavior through this joint declaration,\" he said",
      "The declaration clearly reflects the escalation of confrontational thinking in the West",
      " In Europe and the US, conservative forces believe that China and Russia are \"already allied,\" which is the basis for the further strengthening of their bloc, the scholars believe",
      "\"This is certainly not good news for global security, as NATO is trying to retain the 'legacy' of the Cold War and is trying to escalate the toxic trend,\" Cui said",
      "However, the joint declaration is believed to be mainly a political message, and its practical impact in the short term is more limited, observers say",
      " Such an escalation could further undermine Europe's security and even have a negative impact on Europe's global influence",
      "Against the backdrop of a tense regional situation, while the declaration will in a way help boost the West's diplomatic confidence, the international influence in global politics that Europe has accumulated in the past will gradually diminish as it relinquishes its diplomatic autonomy, Zhang said",
      "While NATO and the EU are attempting to build a pattern of bloc confrontation and want China to jump into the trap by following that line of thinking, China clearly recognizes that China and Europe have good prospects for cooperation rather than focusing on confrontation, Cui said",

      "\"However, the underlying anti-China color of the agreement is worryingly obvious, since it came just shortly after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made remarks last week that the US and Japan agree China is their \"greatest shared strategic challenge\" and they confirmed that an attack in space would trigger a mutual defense provision in the US-Japan security treaty, Chinese observers warned",
      "The signing of the space cooperation framework agreement is described by NASA as a highlight of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's visit to Washington, his first since taking office in 2021",
      "The crucial background to Kishida's visit is the Japanese Cabinet's passing of three key defense documents in December 2022, which include a substantial increase in defense expenditure and the determination to possess \"counterstrike\" capability",
      " This marks Japan's largest military reform since World War II, observers said",
      "Blinken and Japan's Minister for Foreign Affairs Yoshimasa Hayashi signed the agreement on behalf of the two countries",
      "\"I expect this agreement to vigorously promote Japan-US space cooperation and expand areas of cooperation for the Japan-US alliance, which is stronger than ever before,\" Kishida said",
      "Known as the \"Framework Agreement Between the Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of America for Cooperation in Space Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, For Peaceful Purposes,\" this pact recognizes a mutual interest in peaceful exploration, NASA claimed in a press release",
      "NASA said it and the Japanese government had finalized a previous agreement in November 2022 confirming Japan's contributions to the lunar Gateway orbiting outpost as part of a commitment to long-term lunar exploration cooperation with NASA under the Artemis program",
      "Japan was one of the earliest signatories of the US-proposed Artemis Accords, aiming to become the second country to land an astronaut on the moon as part of the project, which was widely criticized for its exclusiveness",
      " Media has reported that the pact proposed building safety zones \"surrounding future moon bases in a bid to prevent damage or interference from rival countries and companies",
      "\" And only \"like-minded space partners\" were welcomed in signing in the US-led pact",
      "Japan and the US will accelerate sending the first Japanese astronaut to the moon, Kyodo News said, and the move is \"intended to rival China, which is considering building a lunar research base",
      "\"\"Together, we have advanced the frontiers of human endeavor and scientific knowledge through our partnership - from the creation of the International Space Station to development of the lunar Gateway, a research outpost that will orbit the Moon and be used to prepare for future missions to Mars,\" the US state department said in a press release over the signing of the new US-Japan space cooperation agreement",
      "The Wall Street Journal wrote on Wednesday that the US and Japan had announced initiatives to expand the alliance's security umbrella to safeguard Japanese satellites from attack, and the report cited US officials as saying that such an undertaking was previously only given to NATO allies",
      "Blinken said that any attacks \"to, from and within space\" on Japanese satellites could prompt the invocation of Article V of the US-Japan Security Treaty, the WSJ wrote, while spelling out that political agenda behind is to \"counter China",
      "\"Song Zhongping, a space watcher and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday warned that what lies behind Japan's increasing closeness with the US in the space domain is not only the ambition of becoming a space power with US technology assistance, but also the vicious goals of developing military forces of an offensive nature in space in the name of protecting space assets and gradually breaking through its Pacifist Constitution",
      "The US also needs help from Japan in technology as well as for the money",
      " Experts noted that the Japan needs to understand that \"the satellite protection the US offered demands real cash and such extra money would serve to ease the budget pressure the US is facing on its own in the rivalry against China and Russia",
      "\"Japan should avoid becoming a US lackey in space, and it should abandon the idea of playing the role of a \"sharp spear\" in the alliance as the US has given strong support for, as it would go against the post-war promises and hurt the delicate trust of its Asian neighbors, creating chaos and turbulence in the Asia-Pacific region, analysts said",

      "During the fight against COVID-19, grassroots hospitals were at the forefront of the battle, but their shortcomings were also exposed, such as inadequate equipment to prevent the spread of the virus, lack of responsibility for preventing transmission, and inability to classify patients with different symptoms, Xiong Shuilong, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, told the Global Times",
      "To address these issues, Xiong plans to propose that provincial governments provide better medical equipment and medicines to grassroots hospitals and medical institutions in rural areas, as well as train medical staff in these hospitals on how to prevent communicable diseases",
      "He also emphasized the need to establish an information sharing channel between grassroots hospitals, city hospitals, and health bureaus so that outbreaks can be quickly identified and controlled through collaboration",
      "During China's fight against COVID-19, hospitals at all levels were encouraged to work together and establish triage treatment to ensure that patients with severe symptoms receive timely treatment",
      "Zhang Weibin, a doctor from Ruijin Hospital from Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and a CPPCC National Committee representative, believes that the model of cooperation and coordination between hospitals at all levels should continue in the future",
      " He proposes strengthening the triage treatment system to prevent big hospitals from becoming overwhelmed",
      "Improving the medical system has become a focal point for representatives at this year's two sessions",
      " Zhang Qicheng, a CPPCC representative and a professor from Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, plans to call for a higher-level medical insurance system that allows people to pay no more than 20 percent of medical fees",
      "Zhang believes that a free medical system will not increase the government's medical expenditure; rather, it will save expenses by preventing overspending on minor illnesses",
      "Zhang calls for the pioneering of a free medical system that combines current medical insurance and local government financial funds to avoid transferring financial pressure to hospitals or patients",
      "The pioneer project would be best expanded in grassroots hospitals and hospitals that feature Chinese medicine, enabling these hospitals to play a bigger role in treating patients, according to Zhang",
      "He suggests that the government should cover all medical fees if patients go to these hospitals",
      " However, supporting policies are needed for the free medical care system to prevent the abuse of public hospital resources",

      "Wu Bixia, member of the communist youth league and youth federation of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) , also professor of vocal music and opera department of China Conservatory of Music, suggested setting up pilot areas to speed up the development of a comprehensive system of early warning, detection, reporting and assistance for child sexual abuse in rural areas, bridge the gap between awareness and law in rural areas, effectively safeguard the rights and interests of rural children, and further alleviate the problem that child sexual abuse cases in rural areas are less likely to be detected and more difficult to enter the judicial process,China Youth Daily reported",
      "On March 1, the Supreme People's Procuratorate held a press conference on \"welcoming the two sessions and introducing the procuratorial work over the past five years",
      "\" According to the press conference, over the past five years, procuratorates have prosecuted 290,000 crimes against minors",
      " Among them 131,000 people were prosecuted for crimes of sexual assault against minors, including rape and child molestation, which have become the most prominent crimes against minors",

      "At the same time, the law education should be strengthened, and the \"compulsory reporting system of cases against minors\" and other relevant processesconcerning children's vital interests should be popularized among rural communities",
      "Education authorities should prioritize developinga national teaching plan and curriculum for children's sexual assault prevention designed for parents, Wu said",
      " In light of different age groups, the gap between urban and rural areas and other factors, education departments should reasonably determine the curriculum and curriculum content to ensure that the curriculum is scientific and effective",
      " At the same time, the authorities should give greater priority to education training in rural areas",

      " US Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks on China at Jack Morton Auditorium of George Washington University May 26, 2022 in Washington, DC",
      " Photo: AFPUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday postponed his reported trip to China in response to the flying of what Washington has labelled a \"spy balloon\" over the US, saying the flying of the balloon \"created the conditions that undermine the purpose of the trip",
      "\" This is a fresh signal demonstrating that Washington is lacking sincerity in boosting its relations with China",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry clarified on Friday that the so-called spy balloon or surveillance balloon is a civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes",
      " \"Affected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, the airship deviated far from its planned course",
      " The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace due to force majeure",
      "\"Even though the Pentagon said the so-called spy balloon \"does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground,\" or a significant intelligence gathering risk, many US politicians and media outlets have played up the \"China threat\" with ulterior motive, launching another round of smearing campaign against China",
      "\"Normally, in response to an accidental incident resulting from force majeure, the two sides will move on after expressing regrets",
      " Or they can set how to deal with such kind of incidents as a subject to negotiate",
      " Blinken's response in postponing the trip is not a proportionate response,\" L\u00fc Xiang, research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times",
      "Several causes can explain why Washington is so intent on hyping a civilian airship into a critical political incident",
      " First, the bilateral ties between China and the US are still tense, with rampant anti-China forces at home",
      " They intend to exploit the airship incident to further instigate domestic anti-China sentiment, twist China's global image into a power not abiding by international rules, a huge threat to other countries' security, so that the US can easily solidify its allies to contain China at the international stage",
      " This mirrors how radical and perilous the US' policy toward China is",
      "Furthermore, the heated discussion and exaggeration of the civilian airship suggests that as political polarization intensifies, any incident will become the topic to intensify partisan contest",
      " The so-called spy balloon has become an incident from which ambitious politicians from different political parties can gain political capital and enhance political rights",
      " The GOP has used it as another weapon to attack the Biden administration",
      "And in response, branches of the US government, including the secretary of state, have to take a hawkish position, in a bid to satisfy domestic opposition forces",
      "L\u00fc noted that the US government needs to remain sober and that diplomacy and internal affairs are two separated matters, and it is not wise for the US government to do nothing when the internal conflicts between two parties affect its foreign affairs",
      "Additionally, the timing of the hype is also delicate - ahead of a reported trip although China has not confirmed his visit",
      " Some observers said it does not rule out that Washington deliberately select the timing, in order to add more bargaining chips in negotiating with China after putting more pressure on the latter",
      " Such practice has become a routine of US diplomacy",
      "Given that a senior state department official said the US' \"channels of communication will remain as important as ever",
      " And those channels do remain open,\" Blinken is anticipated to complete the visit to China at a rescheduled date, said L\u00fc",
      "If the US government is willing to fix China-US relations, it is capable of achieving it, including managing the sentiment toward China in Congress and the US society",
      " The key is whether Biden team have the determination and will to improve Washington's bilateral ties with Beijing",
      "But judging from the US government's response to the airship incident, including Blinken postponing a reported China trip, it is short of sincerity in this regard",
      "A souring China-US relationship is not only detrimental to the whole world, but will backfire on Washington itself",
      " It is hoped that Americans with insight will be alert and will not let the bilateral ties further deteriorate",

      " A senior Chinese diplomat on Saturday urged the United States to show sincerity, correct its mistakes, acknowledge and repair the damage it has done to the China-US relations over the Chinese civilian unmanned airship incident",
      " Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remarks when answering questions on China-US relations at a China session of the ongoing 59th Munich Security Conference (MSC)",
      " Calling the incident a political farce created by the US, Wang said China had clearly told the US that the Chinese civilian unmanned airship, affected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, deviated from its planned course and entered the US airspace, and China had urged the US to jointly handle the issue in a rational and professional manner",
      " \"Unfortunately, the US ignored the basic facts and brazenly sent a fighter jet to shoot down the non-threatening airship with a missile,\" he said",
      " \"Such an unthinkable and hysterical action is, without doubt, excessive use of force, and clearly violates common practice and relevant international law",
      "\" China firmly opposes and has strongly protested against the US over its action, said Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee",
      " \"A lot of balloons are flying over the Earth every day",
      " Does the US want to shoot them all down?\" he questioned",
      " \"Such an action is no proof of the American power, but the exact opposite",
      "\" He urged the US to stop doing such absurd things out of domestic political needs and to correct its mistakes",
      " The senior Chinese diplomat said the underlying reason why the unexpected incident has caused such a stir in bilateral relations is the United States' wrong perception and strategic misjudgment of China",
      " Wang said China's policy toward the US, based on the clear and transparent principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, encourages exploring the right way for two major countries with different social systems, histories and cultures to get along",
      " On the contrary, the US sees China as the gravest geopolitical challenge and strategic competitor in its China policy, and it is using all means possible to block and suppress China with such an erroneous view of China, Wang noted",
      " He said that China has never been afraid of competition despite all the US talking about competing with China, but the competition should be fair and rules-based",
      " The Chinese diplomat denounced the United States' CHIPS and Science Act as unilateral and self-serving, saying that the act uses state power to suppress Chinese companies, violates the rules of the World Trade Organization and seriously disrupts the stability of the global industrial and supply chains",
      " The act shows that the US is standing against the free trade that it advocates, Wang said, adding that it will not only undermine the legitimate rights and interests of all other countries, but also compromise the credibility and interests of the US itself",
      " \"A virtuous man acquires wealth in an upright and just way,\" Wang cited an ancient Chinese saying, noting that the US has torn apart its disguise in an attempt to blatantly plunder",
      " Wang urged the US to view China's development in a fair and objective way, pursue a positive and pragmatic China policy, and work together with China to bring China-US relations back to the track of sound and stable development",
      " This serves the interests of the two countries and peoples and also meets the common expectation of the international community, he added",
      " Some 150 senior officials, including over 40 heads of state and government, and leaders of international organizations joined this year's MSC to discuss pressing global security challenges and concerns",

      " Illustration: Liu Xidan/GTWith China's sustained development, the country's comprehensive national strength and international influence continue to ramp up, while Washington's sense of strategic anxiety has also waxed",
      " Overall, the Joe Biden administration has continued its predecessor's negative perception and strategy toward China, identifying China as \"America's most consequential geopolitical challenge\" and suppressing China mainly in the fields of security, economy and technology",
      "The Biden administration's technology policy toward China is similar to that of Trump's team, but with different specific tactics",
      " Biden's team focuses more on semiconductors and chips, abiding by the idea of a \"small yard, high fence\" to promote \"technological decoupling\" from China and intensify internal and external linkages",
      " By spreading anxiety and piling on political and security pressure, Washington is forcing allies and partners to remain the same stance with the US, restricting the export of high-end chips to China through technology export controls and long-arm jurisdiction",
      "In this vein, the Biden administration signed a range of bills and executive orders related to semiconductors and chips, and established the Semiconductors in America Coalition, a cross-sector alliance of companies that make and use semiconductors, as well as the Chip 4 Alliance and try to further expand its membership, and prohibit the US and its allies and partners from providing high-end chips to Chinese companies",
      "However, the US technological blockade against China has not produced the desired effect",
      " Chinese high-tech companies such as Huawei have not gone bankrupt",
      " Instead, China's high-end chip research and development has constantly made breakthroughs, and technological progress in various fields has rapidly advanced",
      "US \"technical decoupling\" from China essentially aims to work as a preventive blockade or sanction",
      " In theory, at least three conditions must be met for such policies to be successful",
      " One is that the country trying to block another has absolute technological superiority and capabilities",
      " Another is that the country targeted by the blockade lacks the ability to independently develop such technologies",
      " Furthermore, the country being targeted by the embargo cannot obtain such technical resources from other countries",
      " In reality, Washington has not fully met these three conditions",
      "First, the US has solid semiconductor and chip technology strength, but it is not an \"all-round champion\" or has absolute technological advantages",
      " In this context, the US cannot blockade China on its own in the field of technology",
      "Second, China has an enormous talent pool, considerable investment in research and development, as well as a strong capacity for independent innovation",
      " That is to say that China has the capability and conditions to realize independent scientific and technological innovation in any field",
      "Third, there are interest differences between the US and its allies as well as its partners, and their science and technology policies toward China are contradictory and counterproductive",
      "In terms of science and technology policies toward China, Washington hopes to solidify its allies and partners to try to limit China's technological progress and strength growth through the \"chip embargo",
      "\" Most of the US' allies and partners tend to follow suit at the instigation and pressure of the Washington, but do not want to harm the economic interests of their own companies, and are reluctant to completely deteriorate their relations with China",
      " Since China is an important consumer and importer of high-end chips, restricting the export of high-end chips to China will impair the interests of the companies from the US, as well as its allies and partners",
      "Furthermore, in order to secure its own superiority in the semiconductor sector, the US requires the chip companies of its allies and partners to invest and produce in the United States",
      " For example, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in 2020 committed at least $12 billion to build its first facility in Arizona, and in November 2022, the chip giant said it planned to bring its most advanced technology in Arizona",
      "The \"oppressive\" cooperation of the US with its allies and partners has led to the accumulation of dissatisfaction among the latter",
      " The US government restricts the export of high-end chips to China on the grounds of national security, which not only damages the interests of the US' domestic companies, but also strengthens China's determination to take the path of independent innovation",
      "In short, although the US policy of restricting the export of high-end chips to China has triggered Chinese companies to face losses and difficulties for a certain period of time, it cannot stop China's technological progress",
      " As related companies of the US and its allies and partners have suffered huge losses as a result, Washington cannot form a consistent policy toward China with these countries",
      " The US' capability to restrict technology and its influence on China will also be further weakened",

      "cn/Photo by Liu Jian)A recent war game scenario run by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) is not worthy of reference, as it was designed to hype the \"China threat\" theory, and to suggest the US should fully arm the island of Taiwan preemptively, and instigate the US military to immediately intervene if a conflict breaks out, Chinese mainland experts said on Tuesday",
      "The US think tank said the simulations indicate the US, Japan and the island of Taiwan would suffer huge losses in defeating the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) if a conflict breaks out in the Taiwan Straits in 2026",
      "From a technical point of view, the simulations are biased and set under a scenario of wishful thinking, as they underestimated the PLA's capabilities and overestimated US and Japanese forces, analysts said",
      "If the Chinese mainland launches a reunification-by-force operation on the island of Taiwan in 2026, it would result in thousands of casualties among Chinese mainland, US, Japanese and Taiwan island forces in a likely defeat of the PLA, which will also leave the US in a crippled state, the CSIS said after running this war game 24 times, CNN reported on Monday",
      "In the simulations, the US and Japan lost dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft and thousands of service members, which would damage the US' global position for many years, according to the CSIS report, which also predicted losses of two US nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in most scenarios and the devastation of the island of Taiwan",
      "The Chinese mainland would also suffer heavily, losing about 10,000 troops, 155 combat aircraft and 138 vessels, the report claimed",
      "Such war game simulations are by no means professional, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times on Tuesday",
      "It is impossible for the US think tank to gain access to the PLA's force deployment and equipment specifications in detail, so the data it used in the simulations are obviously biased and mere wishful thinking, Wei said",
      "\"For example, the think tank predicted the sinking of two US nuclear-powered aircraft carriers",
      " That is too small a number,\" Wei said, citing the PLA's missile strike capabilities working in tandem with naval and air forces",
      "The PLA operates DF-21D and DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles capable of striking moving maritime targets like aircraft carriers at hypersonic speeds against which there is no defense, observers said",
      "On Sunday, the PLA Eastern Theater Command organized cross-service joint alert patrol and realistic combat-oriented exercises in sea and aerial areas around the island of Taiwan, countering collusion between and provocations by external and \"Taiwan independence\" forces",
      " Some 57 aircraft and four vessels of the PLA were detected around the island of Taiwan on the day, with 28 of the detected aircraft including fighters, bombers and drones crossing the so-called median line of the Taiwan Straits and entering the island's self-proclaimed southwest air defense identification zone, according to a press release by the defense authority on Monday",
      "It marked the first time the PLA Eastern Theater Command has announced a joint drill around the island of Taiwan in 2023, but such drills have become routine since at least 2020, and have grown with the increasing provocations by Taiwan secessionists and external interference forces",
      "In 2022, the PLA sent 1,727 planes into the island of Taiwan's self-proclaimed air defense identification zone, compared with about 960 incursions in 2021 and 380 in 2020, AFP reported, citing releases by the defense authority on the island",
      "The PLA's exercises have demonstrated that the Chinese mainland has the confidence, the will and the capability to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, another Chinese mainland military expert told the Global Times on Tuesday, requesting anonymity",
      "If the US and Japan interfere in the Taiwan question militarily, not only will the US lose its nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, it will lose all of its footholds in the Asia-Pacific region, including military bases in Japan, Guam and even Australia, the expert said",
      "One thing is right about the CSIS' war game predictions, and that is that the US and Japan will definitely be left crippled if they interfere in the Taiwan question, the expert said",
      "The PLA Navy's Liaoning aircraft carrier group approached Guam and conducted fighter jet sortie drills there in December 2022",
      "Citing the CSIS report, CNN said that for US troops to prevent the Chinese mainland from ultimately taking control of the island of Taiwan, some constants emerged among the 24 war game iterations it ran, including that the US must be able to use its bases in Japan for combat operations and that the US needs to fully arm Taiwan before shooting starts and jump into any conflict with its own forces immediately, as it is impossible to get troops and supplies onto the island of Taiwan once the conflict starts",
      "This is intentionally instigating the US and Japan to militarily interfere in the Taiwan question and encourage \"Taiwan independence\" forces in their secessionist moves, analysts said",
      "The ill-intended war game will only give the \"Taiwan independence\" secessionist and external interference forces a false vision that will lead them to their doom",
      " On the contrary, they should refrain from any military moves, fully understand that Taiwan is a part of China, realize the deterrent in the form of the PLA, and not overestimate their capabilities, experts said",

      " Illustration: Liu Rui/GTIn recent weeks, the Western media's coverage of China has been dominated by news of it refining its COVID-19 policies",
      " Expectedly, it turned into a China-bashing carnival",
      " Some said the country has lost its fight against the pandemic, others said it's a failure of China's political system, while boasting of the superiority of \"democracy\"",
      " How do we make sense of China's efforts and sacrifices over the past three years? Let us investigate some of the prevailing false narratives",
      "False narrative one: Died from disease control instead of the disease?Some say that China's COVID-19 death toll does not include those who died as a result of delayed or denied medical treatment because of strict COVID-19 control measures",
      " A plausible way to test the validity of such speculation is to compare the country's total deaths during the pandemic and estimated deaths had there been no pandemic",
      " The difference between the two would be the country's excess mortality",
      " According to WHO, between Jan 1, 2020, and Dec 31, 2021, excess mortality in the United States and India was 930,000 and 4",
      "74 million respectively",
      " But China's excess mortality during the pandemic was a negative number, which means China's COVID-19 policy didn't result in excess deaths",
      " On the contrary, fewer Chinese people died because strict disease control measures slowed the spread of the pandemic and also reduced deaths from traffic accidents, alcohol abuse",
      "Because of China's large and aging population, it is inevitable that the virus will lead to more deaths",
      " However, the prevailing Omicron variant is significantly less lethal than the original virus and its Delta variant",
      " More than 90 percent of the Chinese population has been vaccinated, thus putting in place an immunity barrier against the virus",
      " The variety of drugs and rich therapeutic experience now available have significantly reduced the risk of deaths from COVID-19",
      " Therefore, the fact that China is adjusting its COVID-19 policy now instead of one or two years ago is what helped save millions of lives",
      "False narrative two: Fighting COVID at the expense of economy?In the short term, China's COVID-19 prevention and control measures did impact economic growth in some localities",
      " But thanks to its committed policy, China has delivered a way better economic performance than those countries that were swinging between COVID-19 control and laissez-faire",
      " Because China brought the pandemic under control early on, the country was the first major economy in the world to register positive economic growth in 2020, and realize a GDP growth of 8",
      "4 percent year-on-year in 2021, contributing to a quarter of global economic growth and a fifth of world trade",
      " In the first quarter of 2022, China's economy lodged a 4",
      "8 percent year-on-year growth, faster than the global average",
      " With refined COVID-19 measures, according to Morgan Stanley and Nomura Securities, China's economy is expected to grow by more than 5 percent in 2023, which means that China will remain a major force supporting global economic growth and the stability of the capital market",
      "False narrative three: Three-year long quarantine?When talking about people's lives during the pandemic, some paint a bleak picture as if the Chinese people have been forced to stay indoors or quarantined for the entire past three years",
      " But the truth is, Chinese people were able to travel around the country freely most of the time - 2",
      "88 billion domestic trips were made in 2020, 3",
      "25 billion in 2021 and 2",
      "09 billion in the first three quarters of 2022",
      " In 2020 and 2021, very few COVID-19 nucleic acid tests were administered in China",
      " It was not until 2022 when the highly infectious Omicron variant sneaked into the country, that the Chinese government began to conduct regular testing and require negative testing results for those entering public places",
      "These are not novel measures, as many other countries including the US also introduced compulsory measures such as curfews, quarantining, nucleic acid testing, travel restrictions, etc",
      " when the infections were peaking",
      "False narrative four: Policy adjustment as a result of failure?In recent years, some Western media outlets and politicians have taken to criticizing China's dynamic zero-COVID policy",
      " However, now that China has refined some of the measures, the criticism has made way for conspiracy theories",
      " Some are now saying that the fact that cases surged in China after the new measures were brought in indicates that there had been many unreported cases earlier and China lifted the restrictions because it was finding it difficult to implement its dynamic zero-COVID policy",
      "However, the fact remains that prior to the \"10 new measures\" (a major COVID policy adjustment), China had already begun to refine COVID-19 control and prevention measures step by step",
      " For instance, the \"20 new measures\" introduced in November lifted many restrictions, and the consequent rise in infection cases was within expectation",
      " The gradual lifting of COVID-control measures is a vivid demonstration of the fact that China's policy adjustment is planned and proactive, based on facts and science",
      "Some countries never made any effort to stop community transmission of COVID-19 and lifted all restrictive measures when the virus was still very lethal, resulting in the loss of millions of lives",
      " In contrast, the Chinese government chose to lift the restrictions in an orderly manner, and with good reason",
      " We are now fully aware of Omicron's high infection but low mortality rate, and protecting people's health and promoting socioeconomic development are our priorities",
      " In fact, the government has shifted its focus from disease control to medical treatment to respond to the new realities",
      "The fight against COVID-19 is now part of the Chinese people's collective memory, and a valuable one",
      " No one can change it",
      " Over the past three years, the Chinese government put people and people's lives first, and refined COVID-19 control measures in light of the evolving situation",
      " By taking strong initiatives in the fight against the virus, people's lives and health, social and economic development, and people's freedom were protected to the maximum extent possible",
      " China's COVID-19 policy adjustment is essentially and consequentially different from other places where beyond a point the authorities were forced to \"let it go\"",
      " It is an undeniable fact that China has achieved the best result at the least cost",

      "The backlash from US tech companies signals the standoff between Indian and US tech companies will intensify in 2023, with New Delhi stepping up regulation for the world's second most populous internet market, the Wall Street Journal reported last week",
      "It must be pointed out that there already is a growing trend of tightening regulations for the digital sector in many major economies",
      " And dominant positions of US technological giants globally have also prompted concerns in many countries",
      "While making the recommendation for a digital competition law, the Indian parliamentary panel cited the EU's proposed Digital Markets Act and the US' American Innovation and Choice Online Act and the Open App Market Act",
      " Western countries are also broadly making revisions to their regulation on big tech companies to close loopholes for the fast-developing sector",
      "For instance, in November 2022, the UK's Big Tech regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, announced a market investigation on Apple and Google for effective duopoly on mobile ecosystems",
      " In the same month, Germany's antitrust watchdog, Federal Cartel Office, widened antitrust probes of Amazon",
      "In the digital era, digital and internet technologies have increasingly become a critical driver for economic growth in many countries across the world",
      " However, the broad application and commercialization of the technologies have led to negative impacts, including monopoly and violation of data privacy, and in some cases, have even challenged sovereignty and security of other countries",
      "Moreover, it is an indisputable fact that US technology giants such as Google, Amazon, and Meta are constantly eroding away international market share and harvesting global data dividends, while promoting the rapid development of the US digital economy and maintain the US' digital hegemony",
      "Amid growing risks, it is understandable that countries seek to step up their market regulation to secure national security, economic interests and consumer privacy in trans-border data transactions",

      " Photo taken on May 5, 2020 shows Jimmy Lai Chee-ying appearing in court on unauthorized assembly charge in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), China",
      " (Xinhua/Lui Siu Wai)The Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Wednesday expressed strong dissatisfaction with and firm opposition to the British Foreign Office officials' meeting with Jimmy Lai Chee-ying's \"international legal team\" and their comments for interfering in Hong Kong affairs",
      "The actions of the British side slandered Hong Kong's law-based governance, blatantly undermined the rule of law and judicial independence in Hong Kong and violated the principles of international law and the basic norms of international relations, said the spokesperson of Commissioner's Office",
      "Jailed Hong Kong secessionist Jimmy Lai's \"international legal team\" have asked UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for an urgent meeting ahead of his trial on national security charges later this year, according to a report from the BBC",
      "Lai, a dual Hong Kong and British citizen, is awaiting trial on national security charges in one of the most high-profile cases brought by Hong Kong authorities against the so-called pro-democracy movement",
      " If convicted he could face life in prison, the Guardian reported",
      "The UK government has been clear that the Hong Kong authorities must end their targeting of \"pro-democracy voices,\" including Jimmy Lai, according to Sunak's official spokesperson on Tuesday, adding that the British government will always support rights and freedoms and the rule of law, and the Foreign Office has provided support to Jimmy Lai for some time, and the minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan has met his legal team today",
      "Apple Daily, a secessionist tabloid in Hong Kong, issued its final hard copy in late June, 2021",
      " This was seen as a significant event that put an end to an era when foreign proxies and secessionist forces could recklessly meddle in China's internal affairs by cultivating agents, like the paper's founder Jimmy Lai and his media group, who instigated the Hong Kong riots in 2019",
      "The HKSAR Government on Tuesday expressed its strong opposition to the interference of foreign governments in Jimmy Lai's case and the false accusations and criticism against the Hong Kong government",
      " It stressed that no foreign forces or persons should be allowed to interfere in the judicial process and internal affairs of Hong Kong",
      "Moreover, the Hong Kong government opposes and condemns any attempt by the \"international legal team\" and the British government to undermine the rule of law and interfere with the independence of the judiciary in Hong Kong",
      " \"We strongly urge relevant parties to respect the spirit of rule of law and immediately stop interfering in the internal affairs of Hong Kong,\" the government's statement read",
      "Both the Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong and the HKSAR government have stressed that Hong Kong is a society governed by the rule of law",
      " The Basic Law of Hong Kong and the National Security Law clearly guarantee the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong citizens, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press",
      "However, rights and freedoms are not a \"shield\" for crimes, nor a \"talisman\" for undermining national security",
      " No one has the privilege of being above the law, let alone praying for external forces to intervene in the territory's judicial independence, officials said",

      " Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi makes a speech at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, Germany, on Feb",
      " 15, 2020",
      "(Xinhua/Lu Yang)Chinese top diplomat Wang Yi started his Russia visit on Tuesday after his trip to France, Italy, Hungary and a series of meetings with diplomats from countries including the US and Ukraine in Germany on the sideline of the Munich Security Conference, with analysts saying China is making efforts for mediation by engaging with all relevant parties involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, while the US keeps on adding fuel to the flame and exploiting the conflict to make a political show",
      "Wang held talks with Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation in Moscow on Tuesday, Russian media Sputnik reported",
      "US President Joe Biden made a surprise visit to Kiev on Monday and announced a new military aid worth $500 million",
      " Experts said besides bolstering morale in Ukraine's battlefield, the trip is more about a \"political show\" made by Biden for his domestic audiences in the America, and has nothing to do with conflict mediation and peace promotion",
      " \"It's pathetic that the US president can only offer $500 million as a 'meaningful support,' because such money will be spent in probably just one or two weeks,\" said experts",
      "Some Western media are trying to make comparison between the US and China on the two countries' latest diplomatic activities and try to make it look like the two biggest economies are picking sides between the two warring sides of an ongoing war, but Chinese analysts said these Western media outlets deliberately ignored China's engagements and communications with other relevant parties ahead of Wang's visit to Russia, and try to downplay or misinterpret China's efforts for mediation",
      "Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that Washington and some Western media outlets are trying to make the current situation look like \"the US and China are having bloc-to-bloc confrontation, with the US backing Ukraine while China supporting Russia, and this is why US State Secretary Antony Blinken and some other Western diplomats are making nonsense \"warnings\" to China about not to supply Russia with weapons",
      "China and Russia have made very clear many times that the strategic relations between them will not target any third party, and China has the right to have cooperation with Russia based on their own interests, and the US and its followers have no right to point their fingers to the China-Russia relations, Cui noted",
      "Before his trip to Moscow, Wang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, also met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on the margins of the Munich Security Conference",
      "Kuleba said, \"Ukraine and China have kept contact all along the past year,\" and \"Ukraine values China's status and important influence on international arena, as well as China's stance on a political settlement to the crisis",
      " Ukraine expects China to continue its constructive role,\" according to the website of the Chinese foreign ministry",
      "\"This has once again proved that China is paying efforts to mediate, not playing the game of 'bloc-to-bloc' confrontation with Russia,\" Cui said",
      "Zhang Hong, associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that Wang's trip to Russia is not solely focusing on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but eyes on the comprehensive China-Russia strategic ties",
      "\"The main purpose for Wang's trip is to push forward bilateral cooperation in light of the current challenges facing world economy, and make preparation for higher level official exchanges for the two countries",
      " As two major powers that have significant influence in the world, the two sides must maintain a stable and healthy relationship and maintain a smooth communication in fields including trade, energy, global governance and climate change,\" he said",
      "The US and its followers have been using \"colored glasses\" to view issues related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " \"It seems like anyone who talks with Russia will be seen as siding with Moscow in Russia-Ukraine conflict,\" Zhang said",
      "The Munich Security Conference last week should be a platform for mediation when the situation is facing new danger of escalation, but the US and the West cut almost all contacts with Russia, only being interested in how to increase more weapon supplies to escalate the war, which is totally opposite to the mediation effort and peace promotion, experts said",
      "Biden's show in KievBiden announced a half-billion dollars in new assistance, saying the package would include more military equipment, such as artillery ammunition, more javelins and Howitzers",
      " And he said new sanctions would be imposed on Moscow later this week",
      " \"One year later, Kyiv stands",
      " And Ukraine stands",
      " Democracy stands,\" Biden said, CNN reported",
      "A Beijing-based expert on international relations who asked for anonymity told the Global Times on Tuesday that \"such slogans sound weak, boring and useless, when heavy casualties and huge cost of ammunitions and other expenditures are troubling Ukrainian forces in the battle fields while the Russian side is still able to prepare for another major offensive",
      "\"Based on the cost of the war under current intensity, $500 million will soon be exhausted in the battle fields in one or two weeks, so such announcement by Biden and his visit to Kiev is actually a show to shape his image as a \"champion of democracy and freedom,\" and has nothing to do with the life and death of Ukrainian people, the expert said",
      "\"Russia cannot be defeated on the battlefield,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a message to the Federal Assembly on Tuesday, TASS reported",
      "Putin's message shows that Russia is going to follow through the military operation, and is prepared to fight against NATO, said Li Yonghui, a senior research fellow in the Institute of Russia, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences",
      " Li predicted there will be a big spring offensive in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the crisis is likely to escalate",
      "Putin's speech is a response to the anti-Russia narratives in the Munich Security Conference, Russian political scientist Vladimir Pavlenko told Global Times on Tuesday",
      "A responsible and feasible act at the moment is to help the two warring sides to realize negotiation for ceasefire, rather than encourage one side to completely defeat the other side even this could cause further escalation, and this attempt is \"costly, dangerous and unrealistic,\" but this is also what the US and its allies love to do at this moment, the Beijing-based expert noted",
      " \"This is the main reason why we are still yet to see the dawn of peace",

      " At a critical juncture of history, human society must not repeat the old path of antagonism, division and confrontation, and must not fall into the trap of zero-sum game, wars and conflicts, he warned",

      " He told the Global Times that despite many changes in the international landscape, Russia and China have a high degree of mutual trust and anyone who tries to \"drive a wedge\" between the two countries' friendship will not succeed",
      " As for the Ukraine crisis, he said that Russia has never refused to engage in dialogue with Kiev and the West",
      " And of course, this can only happen when they \"take Russia's fundamental interests and concerns into account",

      "Russian Ambassador to China Igor Morgulov Photo: Courtesy of Russian Embassy in BeijingGT: What are your priorities as Russian Ambassador to China?Morgulov: My top priority as Russian Ambassador to China is very simple - to serve my country and to safeguard the national interests of Russia within the scope of my mandate during the time I have the honor of representing the Russian Federation in China, which includes the all-round development of friendly and cooperative relations between our nations",
      "GT: The Russia-Ukraine conflict, the China-US geopolitical game, and many other factors ha ve brought about significant changes in the international landscape",
      " How do you assess current China-Russia relations? What are your expectations for China-Russia relations in the next few years?Morgulov: Under the strategic guidance of leaders of our two countries, Russia-China relations have reached the highest level in history and have the nature of a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination",
      " The two sides have a high degree of mutual trust, respect each other's interests, and carry out mutually beneficial and close cooperation in all fields",
      " We are good neighbors",
      " There is a Chinese proverb that goes well: A distant relative is not as good as a close neighbor",
      "At the same time, Russia and China are not building a military-political alliance resembling that of the Cold War times",
      " Our relationship, in many ways, transcends this outdated form of cooperation and allows us to act flexibly and effectively to protect the national interests of both countries, instead of establishing a \"hard hook\" in a \"dominant and subordinate\" way",
      " Relations between Russia and China are not aimed at third countries",
      " But in a complex geopolitical environment, we cooperate closely - and this cooperation helps to maintain stability in the international arena",
      "No matter what the circumstances, whether it's the pandemic or the crisis in Ukraine, our mutual trust will only grow stronger",
      " Living evidence of this is the record trade volume between the two countries in 2022, which increased by 29 percent to $190 billion",
      " There is still a vast new world ahead of us",
      " Obviously, if the current speed is maintained, the goal of increasing bilateral trade volume to $200 billion proposed by the two heads of state can be achieved this year",
      "Now that China has optimized its COVID-19 response measures, we hope to resume face-to-face contact and mutual visits between our citizens as soon as possible, and spark a new wave of people-to-people exchanges",
      "I believe that the prospects for the future of Russia-China relations are bright and the road is straight and broad",
      " Anyone who has ill intentions against us and tries to \"drive a wedge\" between our friendship will not succeed",
      "GT: How does Russia view the stance that China has adopted in the Ukraine crisis?Morgulov: Since the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, China has taken a balanced position, stressing the need to resolve the crisis through political and diplomatic channels and to respect the territorial integrity and legitimate security interests of all parties concerned",
      " We respect that position",
      "Chinese leader proposed \"four shoulds\" and \"four commons",
      "\" Chinese friends also put forward a \"six-point proposal\" to prevent a large-scale humanitarian crisis in Ukraine",
      "In addition, China has repeatedly stated that it understands the root causes of the conflict",
      " With regard to their intention to push NATO's military infrastructure toward our borders, China is aware of what this means for Russia and always assesses the situation objectively",
      " China knows the causes and consequences of the 2014 Ukraine crisis",
      " China opposes the revival of the Cold War mentality, bloc confrontation, and unilateral sanctions that have no basis in international law",
      "I would like to note in particular that we highly appreciate China's principled stance and spirit of perseverance in pursuing its independent foreign policy, including the further development of comprehensive cooperation with the Russian Federation",
      "GT: In the future, will Russia seek more energy cooperation with China? Does it also mean that Russia will increasingly \"turn to the East\" diplomatically?Morgulov: Russia-China cooperation in the field of energy is strategic and mutually beneficial, which is a practical embodiment of China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era",
      " Our two countries have set up a special intergovernmental committee on energy cooperation",
      " Trade in energy has been increasing for a long time",
      "Our cooperation in the field of energy is not affected by current geopolitical factors, and it has its own history and future",
      " Projects jointly implemented by enterprises in our two countries will further contribute significantly to the growth of bilateral trade volume and help ensure the energy security of Russia and China",
      "As for the notion of energy-related \"turning East\" diplomacy, I would like to stress that Russia will not, in principle, politicize questions of practical cooperation in this field",
      " Russia is a reliable supplier of hydrocarbons and our cooperation with China is based on mutual respect and mutual benefit",
      " However, the West keeps making baseless accusations that Russia is using energy exports as a weapon and has completely changed the mechanism for importing hydrocarbons",
      " The result of this is that European industrialists and ordinary people have ultimately had to pay the price",
      "GT: Based on the current situation, do you think the Ukraine crisis will become more intense in 2023? Is it still possible for Russia and Ukraine to reach a ceasefire? If this possibility still exists, under what conditions does the Russian side think a ceasefire agreement can be reached?Morgulov: A ceasefire and an end to the conflict is what we have consistently called for, but only if the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation and its legitimate security interests are respected",
      " We have never refused to negotiate with Kiev and are open to dialogue with its Western patrons",
      " And of course, this can only happen when they are able to adopt an attitude of mutual respect and genuine interest, acknowledge current realities, and show a willingness to take our fundamental interests and concerns into account",
      "In the spring of 2022, we almost agreed upon the basic terms for a ceasefire",
      " But the West was reluctant to end the conflict",
      " The actions of the US and its NATO client states so far indicated that they intend to further escalate the situation",
      " They not only provided Kiev with heavy weapons, including American and German-made tanks, but also discussed the possibility of sending fighter jets",
      "These decisions are not made overnight",
      " Effective management and technical maintenance and repair of such complex weapons would not have been possible without the participation of NATO military experts",
      " In fact, they have waged a hybrid war against our country",
      " We have not seen any sign that the opponents want to stop this war",
      "GT: The US, Germany, and the UK are scaling up their military aid to Ukraine, including sending Leopard II and M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine",
      " How will Russia respond to this latest move?Morgulov: German tanks had once appeared on Russian soil",
      " I hope that Berlin does not forget how it ended that time",
      " I firmly believe that this time, our people will still stand the test",
      "The decision by the US, Germany, and other NATO countries to supply Ukraine with tanks, as I have already said, led to a further escalation of the Ukrainian crisis and became irrefutable evidence of the direct involvement of Western countries in the conflict, which they provoked",
      "The White House is waging a \"fight Russia to the last Ukrainian\" war with Russia while trying to tackle several issues at once",
      " The issues included diverting the attention of their own citizens from serious domestic problems, which have become more acute during the pandemic under the guise of aiding Kiev",
      " Washington has continuously poured new funds into the country's military-industrial complex, thereby stimulating the growth of related industries",
      "The US also disposed of obsolete weapons by handing them over to Ukraine, and used the conflict zones as testing grounds for new weapons",
      " Meanwhile, financial and economic sanctions have forced Europeans to buy expensive LNG and shale oil from the US and Canada, thereby reducing the competitiveness of the EU industry compared to the US industry and impoverishing the population",
      " Just like when the financial crisis broke out in 2008-2009, the US is using the dollar's monopoly and its coercive policies in the financial market to force other countries to pay for it",
      "The main goals of the US are to maintain hegemony, strengthen control over Europe, and weaken and subvert regimes in countries that pursue foreign and domestic policies independent of the US",
      " Now, Russia has become the first target set by the US among world powers",
      " But this political and economic war, known as \"containment,\" is also being used against a vibrant and peacefully developing China",
      " China has never threatened anyone and seeks to create a favorable external environment for itself through dialogue, cooperation, and friendship",
      "The supply of tanks showed that Washington has no \"bottom lines",
      "\" If Washington and NATO countries provide Kiev with weapons including tanks in order to strike deep inside our country and attempt to seize our constitutional territory, it will force us to take severe retaliatory action",
      "I should like to remind people that the Leopard 2 tank is equipped with a sub-caliber armor-piercing projectile with a uranium core, the use of which will contaminate the area, as happened in Yugoslavia and Iraq",
      " If they hand over such shells to Ukraine, we will consider it a \"dirty bomb\" against Russia, with serious consequences to follow",

      " Indonesian President Joko Widodo greets Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang during their meeting at Merdeka Palace in Jakarta, Indonesia on February 22, 2023",
      " Photo: VCGChinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang on Wednesday stressed that a Cold War or big power competition should not emerge in the Indo-Pacific region, and ASEAN members should not be forced to take sides, after meeting with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi",
      "Observers believe Qin's remarks not only deliver China's message to regional members to retain their strategic independence, but express China's hope that ASEAN remains wary of being used by external forces to counter China",
      "Qin made the comments at a press conference held with Retno, during which he said he believes ASEAN members can make independent judgments and choices based on the region's interests",
      " China supports ASEAN members' strategic independence and unity and opposes confrontation and bloc politics, according to a readout published by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday",
      "Indonesia is committed to regional peace and prosperity and ASEAN should not become a proxy for any power, said Retno",
      " She stressed that as Indonesia takes up the bloc's rotating chairmanship, it will strengthen cooperation with China",
      "On Wednesday morning, Qin also visited President Joko Widodo at the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, where the president \"conveyed the importance of Indonesia and China being the engine of peace and stability in the region, as economic development cannot be carried out without peace and stability,\" according to a statement from the palace",
      "The trip marks Qin's first overseas visit since he took office as China's Foreign Minister in the New Year, which experts believe showcases the special importance China attaches to its ties with Indonesia, as well as ASEAN",
      "Chen Xiangmiao, director of the world navy research center at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, said the statement from Qin signals not only China's hope that the ASEAN can remain independent from big power competition, but also remind it to avoid being used by external forces, namely the US, to counter China",
      "Washington has upped the frequency of its activities in the region to sow discord between China and the bloc in recent years",
      " The most recent case is the US trying to hype the friction of the \"laser incident\" between China and the Philippines to sabotage bilateral relations",
      "Luckily, from Retno's statement, it is clear that the bloc adheres to its independent strategy, and will not fall into becoming a pawn for certain forces, according to Chen",
      "In Jakarta, Qin chaired the fourth iteration of both nations' Joint Commission on Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC), which was last held in Beijing in 2018",
      " The consensus said that both sides, along with other ASEAN members, will seek full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and expedite the South China Sea Code of Conduct (COC)",
      "The negotiation of the COC has made certain progress during the years, while it was shadowed by the COVID-19 to certain degree during the past three years",
      " Chen, however, is positive that negotiations on the code will continue this year",
      "\"First of all, face to face negotiations will resume as countries have entered the post-pandemic era",
      " More importantly, competition over the South China Sea has intensified over the past years as external forces, such as the US, UK and Australia, try to make waves in this region, thus the bloc believes a COC is needed to give this area an institutional safeguard,\" Chen said",
      "The consensus includes deepening cooperation on all fronts, be it political, economic and people exchanges",
      " The two ministers discussed how to ensure the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Railway (HSR) in Indonesia would open to passengers on time, so that China will import more staple commodities, agricultural and fishery products from Indonesia and the two countries will expand cooperation on green development, digital economy and healthcare",
      "China is Indonesia's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade surpassing $100 billion in 2021, up by 58",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/Global TimesAn active duty US four-star general recently expressed his belief that the US will go to war against China over Taiwan island in 2025 in a memo sent to the officers he commands",
      " The memo predictably found its way into the public domain",
      "That prediction is only the latest of many by senior US military officials in recent years",
      " They are all similar in content, but each one in succession has a nearer time horizon",
      " Their prophesies consistently omit the fact that China steadfastly expresses its preference for reunification by peaceful means",
      "The permissibility of such public warmongering by uniformed US generals and admirals calls into question civilian control of the military firewalling officers from foreign policy development",
      " The typical outcome is that such sensational media reports of military concern alarm the White House and Congress alike",
      " In the case of Taiwan island, this leads to the increased production of advanced weapons and their accelerated delivery",
      " The knee-jerk policy responses to military coercion are things observed in the foreign countries the US has condemned and fought in wars against in the past",
      "Given that all evidence points to a role reversal in US national security policy-making, there must be a rational explanation for an otherwise unconstitutional evolution",
      "Beginning with the spectacular victory of the all-volunteer US military in the first Gulf War, the negativity of the Vietnam war was finally overcome",
      " In the years and decades that have followed the military has rightfully emerged as an exemplary, though less representative class, that showcases the best in American character",
      "At the same time members of Congress are unencumbered by conscription, and far fewer have elected to serve in the military",
      " This gave rise to two phenomena",
      " The civilian political class today lacks military insight and expertise, increasing its dependence on active duty and retired military leaders in policy development",
      " Additionally, Congress' reduced service credentials have cowed many elected officials from challenging military perspectives and resource requests out of fear of being characterized as unpatriotic",
      "As a consequence, new generations of general officers and admirals have emerged as celebrated and largely untouchable public figures",
      " In particular, four-star flag officers now constitute an elite special class that is considered above reproach by default, roughly corresponding to a form of American royalty",
      " Four-star flag officers in particular, are fawned over by the media, Congress, and throughout the Executive Branch, and coveted for employment in the defense industry and media as retirees",
      "The recent public senior leader comments presume an ever more immanent conflict with China, and imply support for an increase in US Indo-Pacific Command military capabilities and arms sales for and to Taiwan island",
      " In a fashion that is indistinguishable from civilian obedience to the military, an uncritical US president and Congress reflexively concur",
      "General officers and admirals are anything but irrational",
      " Knowing from precedent that the impact of warmongering words could have on policy in the current climate, what caused an active-duty leader to depart from our tradition of military subordination to civilian leadership? Public messaging is as impactful as issuing orders",
      "Despite their rightfully celebrated status, like all human beings, senior generals and admirals are fallible and are not immune to conflicts of interest",
      " They are not insulated from powerful factors that have little to do with the best interests of their Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines or even American society",
      " Instead, they find themselves torn and politicized within a network comprised of competing interests",
      "These often include their future ambitions as four-star flag officers are at the peak and nearing the end of their military careers",
      " They also could include personal loyalties to and friendships with retired senior mentors under whom they once served and who are now working in defense industries with revenue and profit agendas",
      " Finally, they might want to preserve their forward leaning legacies, all the while with a subconscious awareness that advocating a bigger stronger military in the nearer term improves their odds of being coveted by the largest defense contractors in retirement",
      "Mind reading is impossible, and some out-lying officers may indeed be immune to such forces",
      " But past precedent is informative in the case of future retired military four-star employment",
      "For example, Lockheed Martin Corporation, BAE Systems Inc",
      ", Raytheon Technologies, and Huntington Ingalls Shipbuilding all employ four-star flag officers",
      " These do not count the many dozens of retired three, two and one-star generals and admirals that are employed on boards throughout the defense industry",
      "A number of retired four-star generals and admirals spread across just eight of the US' largest defense contractors is noteworthy",
      " Together, these eight companies are overwhelmingly responsible for and benefiting from the arming of Taiwan island and US preparedness to fight China",
      "Returning to the issue of any rational active duty flag officer's public comments having a predictably out-sized influence on American foreign policy, a permissive US government culture is suspect",
      " Any suggestion that Chinese mainland will likely invade Taiwan island in 2025 when that comment does not reflect China's history or preference for peaceful reunification fails to promote a One China policy",
      " Instead, it could be interpreted as an incitement to fight influenced by a network of competing material interests",

      " As a major world economy with high political certainty as well as great economic resilience and potential, China will maintain a stable environment for people and capital around the globe who are seeking stability and certainty in a turbulent world",
      "Some Western media claimed the Government Work Report indicates that China set \"cautious\" growth targets after the \"collapse of its stringent Zero-COVID policy,\" but analysts stressed such bad-mouthing cannot check China's potential for development but only expose certain countries' own incompetence and failure to contribute to and benefit from global recovery",
      "Stability and developmentThe world in 2023 could still face many uncertainties",
      " Apart from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict that could further worsen the security and economic situation of not only Europe but also the world, experts said the potential sovereign default of the US is also a huge risk for global recovery, encouraging China to be more pragmatic on setting targets",
      "But in Chinese culture, a crisis always consists of danger and opportunity, analysts said, adding the Government Work Report shows that China has confidence to seize opportunities in a turbulent world to realize its own goals and inject hope and momentum into the global recovery",
      "China set its annual GDP growth target at around 5 percent for 2023, as the country embarked on a rapid economic recovery after a decisive victory against COVID-19, with emphasis on ensuring economic stability and high-quality growth, sustainable development amid global economic volatility and geopolitical uncertainty",

      " \"Due to the US' irresponsible strategy and selfish financial and economic policies, the potential sovereign default of the US has become a huge, systemic risk for the fragile world economy, and Washington keeps fueling the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, putting China's development under increasing challenges",
      "\"According to the Financial Times on February 16, the US government risks an unprecedented default as soon as July if the debt ceiling is not raised, the Congressional Budget Office warned amid a growing war of words between the White House and congressional Republicans over lifting the borrowing limit",
      "Meanwhile, the US' worrisome domestic governance and partisan struggles are putting the world economy at risk since the US economy is so intertwined with all other major economies",

      "\"In the future, China will firmly push the peaceful reunification process based on its overall policy for the new era on resolving the Taiwan question,\" so the cross-Straits situation will remain changeable, and the Chinese government will put efforts into making it change in the way that serves the common will and interests of all Chinese people, Tian said",

      " This will elevate China's capacity in independent innovation in the rare earths industry and help fend off the impact of restrictions on imports of the critical minerals imposed by the US and its allies",
      "China's rare earth industry, although it has made great strides in the past decade, still lacks sufficient research and innovation",
      " It faces mounting challenges from developed countries, including the US, Japan and some European countries, Yan Hongwei, deputy head of the Baotou Research Institute of Rare Earth's Hangzhou branch, who is also a deputy to the 14th NPC, told the Global Times on Monday",
      "In order to tackle those problems, Yan submitted a motion to this year's NPC, China's top legislature, proposing to establish a national-level innovation center of rare earth in Baotou",
      " According to Yan, the center can gather talents and resources in the rare earth mining industry from all over the world and make quick breakthroughs in strangleholds, which will help reduce costs and maintain China's leading position in global industry",
      "Competition surrounding rare earth, which ais used to make components in a wide range of products, including smartphones, electric vehicles and precision-guided weapons, has grown fiercer in recent years",
      " China is the world's leading reserve, producer and exporter of this critical mineral",
      "Baotou is dubbed the \"capital of rare earth mining\" as it is China's largest raw material supplier of rare earth",
      " The city accommodates 10 national-level innovation research platforms for rare earth technology",

      " Emerging rare earth suppliers in Southeast Asia are keeping pace with China by upgrading their industries",
      "The Biden administration in February announced actions taken by the federal government and private industry in the country to boost the supply chain for rare earth and other critical minerals, in a bid to reduce reliance on China",
      "The measures include a US$35 million contract from the US Department of Defense to MP Materials, the only integrated rare earth mining and processing site in the US, to process heavy rare earth elements at the company's California production site - the first processing and separation facility of its kind in the US",

      " At that time, both sides said in a joint statement that they would strengthen exchanges at high and various levels",
      " Lukashenko's visit to China will help the two sides further implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state",
      " Belarusian media predicts that the key areas the two sides will discuss include political, economic, investment, and humanitarian cooperation, as well as the joint response to severe challenges in the current international situation",
      "China has another \"iron brother\" besides Pakistan, that is, Belarus",
      " Over the past 31 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China and Belarus have supported each other and cooperated for mutual benefits",
      " China is one of the first countries to recognize Belarus' independence, and Belarus is also among the first countries to respond to and participate in the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative",
      " The China-Belarus industrial park, jointly built by the two countries, is known as a \"pearl\" along the Silk Road Economic Belt",
      " The economies of China and Belarus are highly complementary, and the potential to further strengthen cooperation is vast",
      " The two countries will use more concrete practices to enrich and define their all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership, and the high-level political mutual trust between the two sides has made all of this full of hope",
      "Prior to this visit to China, President Lukashenko recalled his first trip to China decades ago and how he was touched by China's rapid development over the years",
      " He said compared to the past, today's China has made enormous achievements in development and played an important role in international affairs",
      " Lukashenko said that no problem in the world today can be resolved without China, adding that Belarus' development also cannot be achieved without drawing on China's experience",
      " As a witness, President Lukashenko's profound understanding and recognition of China's path to Chinese modernization has added weight to the relationship between China and Belarus",
      "At the same time, this visit has also received special attention from the international community due to the Ukraine crisis",
      " Just before President Lukashenko's visit to China, China released its Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis, which has met wide expectations from the international community",
      " Belarus has clearly expressed its support for and approval of China's position",
      " Both China and Belarus support to peacefully dissolve conflicts through diplomatic means",
      " If the two countries strengthen communication on the Ukraine issue, it will obviously be helpful to resolve the crisis, rather than adding fuel to it like some major powers have done",
      "We have also noticed that some Western media outlets still view this visit through a biased lens, describing Belarus as Russia's \"little ally\" and suggesting that China's \"expanding influence\" should be a cause for concern",

      "cnWhat are the intentions behind the US in spreading false information about China \"providing weapons\" for the Russia-Ukraine conflict? Where is the conscience of the US, the world's largest arms provider, when its military industry is making a fortune from the battlefield in Ukraine? The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday in response to recent remarks of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken about China considering arming Russia with lethal support",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Blinken said the US was \"very concerned that China is considering providing lethal support to Russia\" and that he has made clear to the Chinese side that \"would have serious consequences in our relationship,\" reported Reuters",
      "Blinken was reportedly to have warned top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi of \"consequences\" should China provide material support to Russia, the report said",
      "Commenting on Blinken's claims, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that the US, who is the largest arms provider for Ukraine, has just promised another $500 million worth of military aid a day before",
      " \"Now, they are spreading false information about China supplying weapons [for the Russia-Ukraine conflict], what are their intentions? The US claims, as always, that it wants to maintain peace, but in reality it's making big money from the war,\" Wang noted",

      "\"The reality has long torn apart the US' fake mask of a 'peace keeper,' and exposed its real face that it's eager to see the world in chaos,\" Wang added",
      "Regarding China's ties with Russia, Wang said that as comprehensive strategic partners, the relations between the two sides are based on non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting of any third party",
      " It is a matter within the sovereignty of two independent countries",
      " China will never allow the US to give orders or even exert pressure on handling its ties with Russia",
      "He urged the US to reflect on its own deeds and stop making profit from others' misfortune",

      " Photo: Sina Weibo of PLA Eastern Theater CommandThe joint drills by the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) around the island of Taiwan on Sunday in response to the recent escalation in the US-Taiwan collusion were record-breaking, surpassing even the peak number observed in the large-scale PLA drills held in August following US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative visit to Taiwan, as the PLA again demonstrated its capabilities in blockading the island and shutting down all external interference attempts, experts said on Monday",
      "After announcing the cross-service joint combat alert patrols and joint fire strike exercises in maritime and aerial areas around the island of Taiwan on Sunday, the PLA Eastern Theater Command on Monday released a video documenting the operation",
      "Fighter jets, bombers and warships took part in the drills, and the warplanes were close enough to the island of Taiwan to see the island's Central Mountain Range with the naked eye, according to the video",
      "\"Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and our operation aims to safeguard peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits",
      " We will take any necessary countermeasure,\" a naval officer said in a radio broadcast on board a warship, the video shows",
      "The armed forces on the island of Taiwan were able to detect 71 PLA warplanes, and seven PLA warships were observed around the island from 6 am on Sunday to 6 am on Monday, according to a press release on Monday by the island's defense authority",
      "Some 47 of the detected aircraft crossed the so-called median line of the Taiwan Straits and entered the island's self-proclaimed \"southwest air defense identification zone,\" including 12 J-11 fighter jets, six Su-30 fighter jets, a CH-4 armed reconnaissance drone, six J-10 fighter jets, 18 J-16 fighter jets, a Y-8 electronic warfare aircraft, a Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft, a KJ-500 and a WZ-7 reconnaissance drone, the press release said",
      "This marked a record-breaking number in terms of PLA aircraft detected in the region, media on the island said",
      "The intensity of the drills surpassed, or was at least comparable with the peak number during the PLA drills in August in response to Pelosi's provocative visit on August 2, if taking vessels into account, observers said",
      "On August 5, Taiwan's defense authority reported sighting 68 PLA aircraft and 13 PLA vessels, and on August 7, it reported 66 PLA aircraft and 14 PLA vessels",
      "This showed that the PLA can organize such large-scale exercises repeatedly and at any time, and turn them into real actions when necessary, analysts said",
      "The drills came after US President Joe Biden on Friday signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, which marked the first time the US government will finance weapons for the island of Taiwan",
      "A large number of warplanes and warships were deployed in the drills right after the signing of the US National Defense Authorization Act, indicating that the PLA is ready to deal with emergencies at any time, Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times on Monday",
      "The US' financing of weapons to Taiwan island is a serious provocation that has crossed the bottom line, and the PLA's drills were a response that showed its strong will and capability, Fu said",
      "Taiwan is an island close to the Chinese mainland, and through these drills, the PLA has displayed its capabilities in preventing external forces from coming in and Taiwan secessionists from going out, another Chinese mainland military expert told the Global Times, requesting anonymity",
      "The latest drills also coincided with several other ongoing major PLA activities, including the Liaoning aircraft carrier group's drills in the West Pacific and the China-Russia joint naval exercise in the East China Sea",
      "The Liaoning aircraft carrier group has been conducting exercises in the West Pacific east of the island of Taiwan and south of Japan since December 16, having hosted about 180 carrier-based fighter jet and helicopter takeoff and landing exercises by Thursday, according to a press release by Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff on Friday",
      "From last Wednesday to this Tuesday, China and Russia are holding the Joint Sea 2022 naval drill in the East China Sea in a move to display the two sides' determination and capability in strengthening efforts to jointly deal with maritime security threats, as well as safeguard international and regional peace and stability",
      "It shows that the PLA is capable of simultaneously conducting multiple major military activities in multiple regions, as well as surrounding the island of Taiwan from multiple directions, analysts said",

      " Photo: AFPThe death toll from the devastating earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria is continuing to climb",
      " In an exclusive interview with the Global Times, Mohammed Hasanein Khaddam, Syrian Ambassador to China, said that the roots of Syria's suffering - the US' long-arm jurisdiction - are further exacerbated by the disaster",
      "The US long-arm jurisdiction wears political glasses, and targets \"non-malleable\" countries",
      " Even in this shocking humanitarian calamity they failed to depoliticize their attitude, Khaddam said",
      "The US sanctions \"tightened the noose\" around the Syrian economy, and split the Syrian banks from the international financial system, so that you cannot trade with other countries and are even unable to buy medication and survival equipment, Khaddam told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "Syria has faced US sanctions since 1979, which have got worse since then",
      " This has been their convoluted diplomacy in the Middle East that \"succeeded\" in keeping the crisis alive for decades, the envoy said",
      " \"No wonder it has lost its credibility in the region even with its friends there",
      "\"Unfortunately, the situation is really difficult and painful amid the earthquake, and the Syrian government mobilized all available resources for the afflicted areas, but the catastrophe is widespread, Khaddam said",
      "\"Many people are still under the rubble,\" he said",
      " Buildings and infrastructure have been hit hard",
      " Tens of thousands became homeless because large numbers of buildings are dilapidated and uninhabitable due to the first quake and the aftershocks, so the number of deaths is in the thousands and on the rise, with hospitals and medical centers overstretched",
      "The Syrian government issued on the first day of the catastrophe an appeal calling on all countries, international organizations and funds, and governmental and non-governmental organizations to extend emergency assistance, especially search and rescue machinery and equipment, the ambassador said",
      " \"The first priority is saving, then curing, sheltering and providing survivability means",
      " Of course we feel deeply touched and grateful to all countries that sent condolences and provided or offered assistance",
      "\"Fresh snowfall in Syria on Wednesday has compounded the already desperate situation faced by millions of people whose lives have been affected by the earthquake disaster, said the UN's top humanitarian official in the country",
      "On Wednesday, China urged the US to put aside its geopolitical obsession and immediately lift unilateral sanctions on Syria since Washington's long-term involvement in the Syrian crisis with military intervention and economic sanctions has resulted in a large number of civilian casualties and difficulties in economic development and the reconstruction process in the country",
      "The US should open the door to humanitarian aid in face of the catastrophe, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said",
      "Throughout the Syrian war, the US nourished and fostered terrorist groups and used them as tools to destroy Syria",
      " The US has also been stealing Syrian oil and agricultural products, which incurred losses totaling more than $110 billion, in addition to imposing a blockade to suffocate the economy, the envoy said",
      "\"This, no doubt, shows the roots of our suffering which is further exacerbated by the earthquake",
      " These sanctions are deadly under the 'rule-based order',\" he said",
      "In terms of the quick response, many aid agencies in China, both governmental and nongovernmental, announced their intention to provide Syria generously with much-needed aid, the envoy said",
      "\"There are now rescue teams from China on the ground",
      " We also received many heartily compassionate messages and calls of support from the Chinese people, which are deeply overwhelming,\" he said",
      " \"Many Chinese friends answered our call of appeal; many even came to the embassy to offer their compassion, which was truly touching",
      "\"The Red Cross Society of China sent the first batch of medical supplies, which will meet the needs of 5,000 people, to the earthquake-stricken area in Syria from Beijing on Thursday morning, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Thursday",
      "Besides the cash and material assistance already announced, China is also speeding up the implementation of food aid programs to Syria, with 220 tons of wheat on the way to Syria and the remaining 3,000 tons of rice and wheat to be shipped in two batches in the near future, the ministry said",
      "\"We feel inundated with compassion, and cannot thank enough these feelings and prompt responses at the official level and from the people, which mirrors the humane soul of the Chinese civilization,\" Khaddam said",

      " A picture released by the Danish Defence Command shows the gas leak at the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline seen from the Danish F-16 interceptor on Bornholm, Denmark on September 27, 2022",
      " The two Nord Stream gas pipelines linking Russia and Europe have been hit by unexplained leaks, raising suspicions of sabotage",
      " Photo: AFPMore than four months after the explosion of Nord Stream pipelines, a shocking report by US investigative journalist Seymour Hersh released on Wednesday has once again ignited international public opinion",
      " The report provides details of how the US intelligence agencies planned the sabotage under the order of US President Joe Biden and how the US Navy carried out the bombing with the cooperation of the Norwegian forces",
      " After the report was published, Washington quickly denied it",
      " But simply using the phrase \"fake news\" is obviously not convincing",
      " The international community needs to keep asking Washington until it gives a convincing explanation",
      "The 85-year-old Hersh is a famous Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist",
      " More than 50 years ago, his report that exposed the US military's massacre of Vietnamese civilians significantly pushed the anti-war movement in the US",
      " He was also behind the investigation of the notorious incident of Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse in 2003 and contributed to revealing the Watergate scandal, one of the most disgraceful political scandals in Washington's history",
      " Hersh's latest report is not comparable to conspiracy theories in public opinion, nor are they something Washington can just gloss over",
      "To be honest, the suspicions about the US are not baseless, but the details that got exposed still send chills down one's spine",
      " For example, the report claims that Washington had been secretly planning the sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines since the end of 2021, long before the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " And in more than nine months of debate, Washington focused not on whether to blow up the pipelines, but on how to leave no evidence behind",
      " Therefore, the execution forces, time, place, and the way the explosion was carried out were all carefully planned",
      " Even the most imaginative screenwriter in Hollywood would not dare to write such a plot",
      " If what is reported in Hersh's article is true, then the world will probably have to reassess the US' capability to disrupt peace",
      "The explosion of the Nord Stream pipelines, one of the world's most important transnational energy supply infrastructures, was an extreme event in international politics",
      " Under the fragile political mutual trust, the Nord Stream pipelines were once a main artery of energy connecting Western Europe and Russia, stabilizing the security situation by expanding common interests",
      " Because of this, it has always been a \"thorn in the eye\" of Washington",
      "With the blast of the Nord Stream pipelines, the only remaining bridge to build common security in Europe was destroyed, which means that Western European countries have to choose to be deeply bound with the US at the crossroads of the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " Hersh also mentioned in his latest report that \"Germany and the rest of Western Europe would become addicted to low-cost natural gas supplied by Russia - while diminishing European reliance on America",
      "\" This is one of the main reasons Washington decided to blow up the Nord Stream pipelines",
      "Attacking and destroying major civil infrastructure is a highly egregious act of terrorist nature and must not be tolerated",
      " The international community has no dispute over this",
      " After the explosion, many countries publicly condemned it, and the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also declared that sabotage on the Nord Stream gas pipelines would be \"in no-one's interest",
      "\"The Global Times then published an editorial, calling for relevant international agencies to set up a joint investigation team to restore the truth as soon as possible, find out the perpetrators, and let them be punished",
      " But as expected, some countries are blocking such an international investigation, and more than four months have passed, with little progress made",
      " Hersh's report now at least provides an important clue to the international investigation",
      "It is worth noting that the US mainstream media, which has always claimed to be \"professional\" and \"independent,\" was selectively blind to Hersh's revelations or simply reported denials by the US government",
      " Compared with their unanimously pointing their fingers at Russia after the explosion, this abnormal silence shows that American media agencies are very clear about when to be high-profile or low-key",
      "A large number of facts show that the US is the well-deserved leader in the \"double standard arena",
      "\" It is obsessed with and good at fabricating rumors or making groundless accusations against others",
      " But it will never admit its own mistakes or even crimes, even if the evidence is solid",
      " It will instead try to blame others",
      " Public opinion predicts that the US government will most likely respond to Hersh's revelations in this way, which will leave another stain on its international credibility",
      "It is likely to become an event with the Rashomon effect in the 21st century for how the Nord Stream pipeline incident happened",
      " But it does not mean that we should give up the pursuit of the truth, because it is not only about morality, responsibility, and conscience, but also about what kind of footnotes human beings will write for war and peace when looking back at this period of history in the future",
      " This is very important",

      " The talk at the Spring Festival dinner table was either about whose salary had increased or who was preparing to buy a house or a car, the younger generation was planning to change to a more suitable job, and what the old people talked most was \"you still have to work hard",
      "\"Conversations at the family dinner table often reflect the most realistic public sentiment in China",
      "Before this year's Spring Festival, I thought the conversations would be about the epidemic, but what I didn't expect was that with the current wave of COVID-19 infections coming to an end, conversations among family and friends returned to an atmosphere of anticipation",
      "Just like 20 years ago, the theme always revolved around the future - how to have more stable jobs, more income and give the next generation a better education",
      "",
      "",
      " There were complaints, concerns and arguments at the dinner table, but the talk was more about opportunities, opportunities for economic growth unleashed after the epidemic",
      " 20 years later, the younger generation in the family has grown up, and in their pursuit of life, the deep imprint of the traditional Chinese view of the family can still be seen",
      "The family is the cell of society, and what each family expects is what the whole society expects",
      "China is still a developing country, with thousands of families in the development stage",
      " We no longer expect sudden progress, but are pursuing a steady march forward",
      " To live a richer, more stable life, the generation that has taken on family responsibilities knows that they must work harder and hold on to the opportunities of a fast-moving economy, just like their fathers and mothers did",
      "The family has been central to China's development",
      " As people strive for a better life, they are also driving the economic transformation that has irreversibly changed people's expectations for the country's development and their individual futures",
      "Why do Western experts who predict that China's economy will decline and collapse always miss the mark? Because they often underestimate or simply do not have a deep understanding of Chinese values and family values",
      "Predicting the future of China's economy is not only about the system and the companies, but also about the aspirations and expectations of hundreds of millions of ordinary Chinese people and their willingness to make more efforts for a better life for their families",
      "For more than 40 years, it is these ordinary Chinese people who have created today's Chinese economy through hard work and struggle",

      "The Chinese New Year is not only about red lanterns, lion dances, firecrackers and fireworks, but also about family reunions as well as the expectation of a blossoming spring and a bountiful harvest",
      "In today's world, the scarcest thing is certainty, and experts are struggling to find it, but I see from this year's Spring Festival family reunions that certainty is actually in every family",

      "Observers said on Thursday that the US' intentions behind the \"open secret\" are crystal clear, including but not limited to justifying US sanctions and other anti-China deeds, undermining China's peaceful stance on the conflict to stain China's international image, as well as hijacking allies for a bloc confrontation taking shape",
      "Reuters, citing four anonymous US officials and other sources, reported on Wednesday that the US is sounding out close allies about the possibility of imposing new sanctions on China if the latter provides military support to Russia",
      "The consultations, which are still at a preliminary stage, are intended to drum up support from a range of countries, especially those in the wealthy Group of Seven, to coordinate support for any possible restrictions, Reuters said",
      "Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow at the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, interpreted the move as the US actively roping in allies in preparation for a bloc confrontation",
      "To court is also to hijack, Cui told the Global Times on Thursday, adding that the US wants to ensure coordinated actions not only on Russia, but also on China, and Washington is the last in the world that is willing to see Europe act with autonomy",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel may visit China in the first half of 2023 and the two sides are expected to usher in frequent high-level mutual visits, China's envoy to the EU revealed recently in an exclusive interview with the Global Times",
      " French President Emmanuel Macron said he is about to visit China in April",
      "The US' groundless accusations also reflected its anxiety over the battlefield of Russia-Ukraine crisis and changes in the balance of strength, Cui said",
      "The consultations come at a time when the US, from senior officials to unidentified sources, hyped China's mulling of sending weapons and ammunition to aid Russia",
      "Besides the Reuters report, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday said China cannot put forward peace proposals while feeding the flames of the fire, and threatened to target Chinese firms and people",
      "It is the US that has been supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine, fanning the flames and spreading false information, to which China is firmly opposed",
      " The US should reflect on itself and stop misleading people rather than lecturing others, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at Thursday's press briefing",
      "Cui saw the unwarranted accusation of giving military aid to Russia as part of the US' public opinion war against China and an \"open secret",
      "\"The US knows this doesn't exist, but through all those \"warnings\" based on a hypothesis, the US can justify its ongoing and future sanctions on Chinese firms and accelerate the militarization of the island of Taiwan, the expert said",
      "The Biden administration has approved an estimated $619 million potential arms sale to Taiwan island, including hundreds of missiles for F-16 fighter jets, after a US House of Representatives committee on Tuesday advanced a raft of China-related sanction bills, according to media reports",
      "In response to the arms sale, China will continue to take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard its sovereignty and security, Mao said at the briefing",
      "Some 29 PLA aircraft and four PLA vessels were detected around the island of Taiwan between Wednesday and Thursday, with 21 of the aircraft entering the island's self-proclaimed southwest air defense identification zone, said the island's defense authority in a press release on Thursday",
      "The US' second purpose of \"aiding Russia\" smears is to undermine China's stance of calling for peace and a political solution to the Ukraine crisis, and to smear China's international image as a responsible, peace-loving major power, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times",
      "It has also attempted to use this smear campaign as a preface for more toxic and harmful moves in the future, Li said",

      "Faced with a volatile international situation, the central government has repeatedly reiterated the importance of boosting high-quality development, accelerating the establishment of a new development pattern and advancing Chinese modernization at a series of key meetings from the 20th CPC National Congress to the Central Economic Work Conference held in mid-December 2022",
      "\"In order to promote high-quality economic development, more efforts should be made to improve the added-value of our products, while industrial upgrading should also be promoted to create new consumption patterns and spark new demand,\" Yu said, noting that China is also advancing a broader agenda of opening up across more areas and in greater depth to further stimulate the country's advantage of having a massive market and benefit the global economy as a whole",

      " Photo: AFPUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who is on a visiting tour to South Korea met with his South Korean counterpart on Tuesday",
      " A senior US official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, targeted China again, claiming a \"a sharp uptick in destabilizing PRC [People's Republic of China] operational behavior,\" including what was described as \"dangerous air-to-air intercepts\" and use of \"swarms of maritime militia vessels\" in the South China Sea",
      "Austin will leave South Korea for a visit to the Philippines",
      " The official probably said what Austin is going to say in the Philippines in advance",
      " This set of platitudes that hype the so-called China threat must have bored people",
      "Before Austin arrives in the Philippines, the US media have already begun to hype a \"big news,\" saying that Austin would reach an agreement with Philippine President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr",
      " to open four US military sites at Philippine bases, one of which is located in Luzon Island and another located in Palawan, which was visited by US Vice President Kamala Harris last November",
      " The two places are close to China's Taiwan island the Nansha Islands respectively",
      " The intention of targeting China could not be more obvious",
      " At present, the US military already has five bases in the Philippines on a rotating basis",
      " Adding four more will mean that US-Philippines military cooperation has taken another step forward",
      " This is exactly what the US is striving for",
      "After Marcos was elected president, the Philippines became Washington's key target to woo",
      " Joe Biden was the first foreign leader to call to congratulate Marcos, and senior Washington officials visited the Philippines intensively",
      " If this agreement is reached, it can be regarded as a result of the several months' efforts",
      " With so many diplomatic and political resources invested, the US State Department and the Pentagon truly need to hand over some decent \"political achievements\" to comfort domestic voters, and it looks better when written in PPT",
      "The main significance of this agreement that the US is pushing hard may be that it can be viewed as a \"diplomatic and military achievement project\" for Washington",
      " In order to deal with China, the US is running around the world, especially around China",
      " It is very busy and also exhausting",
      " If Washington's China strategy is compared to a listed company, then it is wasting investors' money in a wrong way",
      " It is a bottomless pit that consumes much but produces little value, let alone making any profit",
      " If it doesn't change course, it will go bankrupt sooner or later",
      "The US and the Philippines are military allies",
      " Whether and how to strengthen military relations is supposed to be a matter between the two countries",
      " But the problem now is that the Philippines wants to ensure its own security, while Washington has tried every means to \"set a trap\" for the Philippines, deliberately linking the cooperation between the two to the \"China threat\" and trying to push the Philippines to the front line of confrontation with China",
      " The difference between the two is obvious",
      " US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's high-profile visit to the Philippines last year reaffirmed the US' \"security commitment,\" while Manila said it could not afford \"any further escalation of tensions in the region",
      "\" Over the past few years, Manila has always maintained strategic sobriety",
      " It knows clearly where its national interests lie",
      "The Philippines emphasizes that its military cooperation with the US \"does not target any specific third party",
      "\" Americans also know that this is because the Philippines is unwilling to \"choose sides\" between China and the US",
      " This attitude is both clear and firm",
      " But if it does not aim at China as a \"third party,\" the US would not have such a great interest in wooing the Philippines",
      " In other words, there are fundamental differences in the stances and interests of the US and the Philippines, which not only requires the Philippines to carefully balance, but also adds Washington's diplomatic costs and weakens its diplomatic effectiveness",
      "Now senior officials in Washington are becoming keener to talk about the \"Taiwan Straits crisis\" with the Philippines",
      " American public opinion has also followed suit, often declaring out of context that the Philippines is highly concerned about the situation in the Taiwan Straits, implying that Manila may get involved",
      " However, the Taiwan question has nothing to do with the Philippines",
      " In a recent exclusive interview with the Financial Times, Marcos reiterated the \"one China\" policy and mentioned \"peace\" many times",
      " This shows that regarding the Taiwan Straits, the Philippines doesn't want war and chaos, so that it will not suffer from the spillover effect",
      " For Manila, it is especially important to see clearly who the real instigator in the Taiwan Straits situation is",
      "How to prudently balance its relationship with major powers is a huge test for Manila, but the scale it can advance should be drawn around the center of its own national interests",
      " The Philippines was once a colony of the US, and it is still a military ally of the US in the Asia-Pacific region",
      " The largest overseas base of the US military was once in the Philippines, but the Philippines took back the sovereignty of the base from the US in 1992",
      " In front of the US, unlike some other countries, the Philippines has generally demonstrated the independence of a sovereign state",

      "Located in Tin Shui Wai, the school is about 20 minutes of drive from the neighboring city Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong Province, which provides more choices for families from the mainland to Hong Kong for work or investment, Troy Lui, chief education officer of Yew Chung Yew Wah Education, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview",

      "From the first to three years of the establishment of the school, it will offer primary and secondary curriculum, and from the four to six years, it will offer senior secondary curriculum and from seven to 10 years, the school is expected to offer curriculum covering 12 years of primary and secondary mainland curriculum education, Lui told the Global Times",
      "\"Our goal is to become an excellent school for racticing the mainland curriculum, and the school will also set up an internal review mechanism, taking reference from the mainland education authorities' annual inspection standards and international school certificate standards,\" he said",
      "The chief education officer said that 900 school places in the initial stage will meet the current and future demand for mainland curriculum",
      " The school, which mainly recruits mainland students from Hong Kong, will also serve Hong Kong local students who intend to study on the mainland",
      "With the integrated development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and Hong Kong attraction to mainland talent, the demand from mainland families in Hong Kong for mainland curriculum will increase, according to local media reports",
      "The school's mainland curriculum with elements of international curriculum implemented will help students, no matter which stage of study they are in, can seamlessly integrate with mainland courses, Lui said",
      "\"On the other hand, it also allows students to have sufficient advantages in terms of bilingual, academic abilities and learning methods whether they choose mainland or oversea universities",

      " They either hype up a China-Russia \"alliance,\" or try to drive a wedge between Beijing and Moscow, saying their friendship won't last long",
      " US Secretary of State Antony Blinken even baselessly claimed that China is considering providing \"lethal material support to Russia,\" including weapons as well as ammunition",
      " The goal of shaping the narrative is to deliberately create an atmosphere that normal interaction between China and Russia is a mistake and to put pressure on every normal interaction between China and Russia",
      "The US has been wearing thick tinted glasses to view China-Russia friendly ties from the very beginning, and has become even more aggressive in this regard after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as if it has found a \"moral\" excuse",
      " However, it is neither qualified nor credible to do so",
      " In fact, regardless of whether there is a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the US, from the bottom of its heart, has never wanted to see the development of China-Russia relations",
      " The suspicions, provocation, and sabotage from Washington toward China-Russia ties have never stopped, and now they have reached a peak because of the conflict",
      " The US strategic community once seriously discussed the possibility of containing China with Russia's help a few years ago",
      " Former president Donald Trump had made relevant attempts during his term in office, which shows that Washington's thoughts on China-Russia relations have never been pure, and always mixed with dark geopolitical calculations, which can hardly be hidden even if Washington puts up a hypocritical mask now",
      "Due to similar geopolitical calculations, the US has repeatedly added fuel to the fire and instigated confrontation in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which is the root cause of the continuous bloodshed on the European continent",
      " However, the development of China's relations with other countries has always been frank and open",
      " Just as Wang mentioned during a recent meeting with Blinken, the\u2002China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era is built on the basis of non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting of third countries, which is within the sovereign right of any\u2002two independent states",
      " We do\u2002not accept the US' finger-pointing or even coercion targeting China-Russia relations",
      "Before visiting Russia, Wang met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on the sidelines of the MSC",
      " According to media reports, Kuleba shook hands tightly with Wang upon meeting",
      " The Ukrainian side values China's position on political solutions to the crisis, said Kuleba during the meeting, emphasizing that he hopes China can continue to play a constructive role",
      "While Blinken made irresponsible accusations against China, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated in an interview that \"Kiev does not have any evidence that China provides military support to Russia",
      "\" But it seems that Ukraine's attitude and ideas only become important to some in the West when they are deemed \"useful",
      "\"China does not want tosee the outbreak of the conflict, nor does it want to see the Ukrainian crisis being escalated and protracted",
      " This is a very sincere attitude",
      " Shortly after the outbreak of the conflict, the Chinese side raised four propositions: the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected, the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be upheld, the legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously, and all efforts conducive to a peaceful resolution of the crisis should be supported",
      " China has repeatedly emphasized that there are no winners in conflict and war, there are no simple solutions to complex problems, and that great power confrontation must be avoided",
      " Looking back now, the value of China's position is becoming increasingly prominent",
      " It is not difficult to distinguish who is really calling for dialogue and striving for peace, compared to some countries that are adding fuel to the fire",
      "Many historical experiences have proven having no contact and dialogue does not help in solving regional and even global problems, but instead often makes the situation more intractable",
      " China and Russia have always maintained an independent and autonomous bilateral relationship, which is a valuable positive asset for both countries and for the stability of international relations",
      " It should also provide more inspiration for international relations, especially against the backdrop of the current complex and difficult situation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict",

      " The neoBay Global Innovation and Entrepreneurship Community, the innovative and sustainable industrial incubator and the prototype of the Grand neoBay, was launched near Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in Minhang district in 2015",
      "With continuous development, the incubator has expanded to a 17-square-kilometer Grand neoBay rim with SJTU and East China Normal University centered, becoming a scientific and innovation cluster with a complete entrepreneurial service platform and ecosystem for growth and cultivation for sci-tech companies, Liu Duo, vice mayor of Shanghai Municipality, said at a press conference on Monday",
      "At present, the Grand neoBay has completed 18 high-level scientific innovation platforms with the settlement of over 3,000 companies that possess the key technologies concerning the national strategic security and the improvement of comprehensive national strength, expected to drive the economic and social changes, Liu said",

      "Based on early-stage full researches and argumentation as well as repeated solicitation of public opinions, the plan stresses to improve original innovation capacities with biomedicine, artificial intelligence, high-end equipment industries to be focused",
      "Also, the plan emphasized to deepen the integration of industry, education, research and application to give priority to trials and implementation of policies such as promoting the commercialization of sci-tech achievements to foster incubators for technology businesses with global influence",
      "The plan also proposes a series of key tasks and measures including three phased goals, five action plans, and four security measures",

      " Cyber security",
      " Photo: ICWhat has happened in the Russia-Ukraine conflict has shown that the internet battlefield is closely related to the battlefield of a hot war, as cyberattacks could lead to power outage and cutoff of energy and food supplies, a Chinese political advisor told the Global Times, whose proposal to this year's two sessions also focuses on enhancing cybersecurity capabilities and considering replacing some technologies with domestic products",
      "Qi Xiangdong, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee and chairman of a leading security provider Qi An Xin Group, said that an important national security challenge that China is currently facing is the theft of state secrets and sabotage of the state facilities by third countries or hostile individuals both domestic and foreign",
      "The damage of those cyberattacks has been rising from \"small troubles\" to \"national affairs",
      "\" In the digital age, cyberattacks could lead to power outage, supply cut-off of meat and oil as daily food necessities and broadcast interruption, having an incalculable impact on people's lives, enterprise production and social stability, Qi said",
      "In recent years, traditional security threats and non-traditional security threats have been intertwined, and the cyberspace has become one of the main battlefields of the game between great powers",
      " China is also facing a more complex national security situation, in which network and data security has become one of the most complex and severe non-traditional security issues that it faces, according to analysts",
      "\"We have seen that in the cyber warfare of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, critical infrastructure has become a key target of attack, and the cybersecurity crisis has actually occurred, and it may be staged in real life at any time in the future,\" said the Chinese political advisor",
      "From the perspective of attack level, the attackers are also changing into professional groups with certain background, Qi said",
      " \"In the past, it was viruses like Panda Burning Incense that threatened us, which did not cause any substantial harm except for minor incoviniences",
      " Now, cyber attackers are often high-level, professional and nationally-backed attack organizations",
      "\"\"Their attack is like a hand in the shadows, always ready for a surprise attack, which must be defended with systematic, practical, and normalized network security capabilities,\" Qi said",
      "Chinese cybersecurity experts recently exposed a hacker group, with its core members coming from Europe and North America, which has been launching sustained cyberattacks against China, posing a serious threat to the country's cybersecurity and data security",
      "On whether China's cybersecurity also faces a technological \"bottleneck,\" Qi said the key to solving this problem is to tackle the major issues in key core technologies",
      "\"The first is threat detection and situation awareness technology",
      " The core of network protection is to perceive and predict, detect attacks, block attacks, and force crimes to stop,\" he said",
      " In recent years, with the continuous upgrading of network attack and defense confrontation, network attack methods have continued to innovate with attacks becoming more unpredictable, it requires threat detection and situational awareness technologies to innovate at a faster pace so that we can outperform cybercriminals, Qi said",
      "The second is vulnerability mining and detection technology",
      " Network attacks originate from vulnerabilities",
      " Vulnerabilities are the natural enemies of protection systems, and vulnerabilities are also the core content of threat intelligence, the political advisor said",
      "At present, most of the mainstream IT software and hardware are from foreign manufacturers",
      " Manufacturers can easily discover and collect vulnerability information on target systems, and the US and Western countries have advantages in this regard, he said",
      "In terms of core software and hardware, network security products still rely on high-end chips and core software",
      " If the supply of these products is cut off, it will affect the shipment of high-performance network security products, Qi noted",
      "If China wants to become a cyber great power, it must have its own excellent technology",
      " For example, according to the requirements of the country's technology innovation planning, the foreign network security system, technology and products should be replaced by domestic products",
      " Especially for the most important and advanced information systems, the foreign network security systems, technologies and products that they originally adopted must be fully replaced, Qi said",
      "China should also increase investment in network security construction",
      " \"Currently, many administrative institutions and enterprises are in a passive position while facing strong cyberattacks,\" he said",
      "The budget for network security construction in administrative institutions and enterprise in China is still far behind that of developed countries",
      " For example, according to the fiscal year 2023 budget proposal announced by the White House, the cybersecurity budget of non-defense federal agencies accounted for 16",
      "57 percent of the IT budget, while the cybersecurity investment of government and enterprise agencies in China accounted for only about 3 percent, Qi said",
      "In 2023, China's cybersecurity industry will grow rapidly as the further application of technologies such as big data, 5G and cloud computing will bring various security challenges to different industries, making the network security protection more complicated",
      "If a breach occurs, the risk will spread rapidly, causing impact to people's lives, business operations and national security at different level",
      " \"With the digitalization accelerating, the role of cybersecurity as a foundation will be further highlighted,\" Qi said",

      "Remarks such as \"striking down Russia and turning it into a second-rate country\" or \"seeking regime change in Russia\" are extremely dangerous, as they escalate the conflict and signal that the possibility of peaceful talks is ruled out, Fu warned",
      "Wang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, visited Russia from Tuesday to Wednesday",
      " On the other hand, Biden made an unannounced visit to Ukraine on Monday",
      "On the eve of the one-year anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, senior officials from China and the US visited Russia and Ukraine respectively, attracting the world's attention",
      "\"The nature of the two visits is completely different",
      " Biden suddenly showed up in Kiev, but Wang's planned visit to Russia was announced earlier",
      " These two visits should not be brought up together in terms of timing,\" Fu told the Global Times",
      "China and the US also take very different positions, as Biden's visit to Ukraine, focused on the Ukraine crisis, aimed to support the continuation of the conflict, but Wang's visit to Russia not only focused on the Ukraine issue but also on other aspects of China-Russia relations, he said",
      "\"When talking about the Ukraine issue, we always take a more fair and reasonable position",
      " We will not take sides but only promote peace,\" the Chinese envoy said",
      "Days ahead of the one-year anniversary of the Ukraine conflict, some media reported that Russia has launched a new counteroffensive while Ukraine has been stocking up bombshells, waiting for tanks and artillery supplied by the West to launch a counterattack",
      "Fu said during the interview that he is pessimistic about the prospect that parties concerned would launch peaceful talks in a short period of time, as it seems that all parties have no desire for talks now",
      " \"But I believe that after a period of twists and turns, they will eventually come to the table for negotiation,\" he said",
      "Instead of waiting until a large number of soldiers die in battle to realize that the war cannot be won, it is better to sit down and talk now, Fu told the Global Times",
      " The US is the biggest obstacle in ending the conflict and it's also the biggest beneficiary of the war",
      "If the US-led West set the goal of defeating Russia, it would be a very cruel and protracted war that will bring great risks to the world",
      " In particular, claims such as \"Russia will be beaten back into a 'second-rate country'\" and \"seeking regime change in Russia\" are even more dangerous and rule out the possibility of peace talks, which can only cause continuous escalation of war and greater damage, Fu warned",

      " Illustration: Xia Qing/Global TimesOn February 3, a train in the US town of East Palestine in Ohio carrying chemicals derailed and exploded",
      " The smoke cloud was huge and could be seen for miles",
      " The environmental damage caused by the spill has been extensive, polluting the wider Ohio River basin area and killing thousands of fish and farm animals",
      " Despite this, authorities have been quite relaxed about its outcome, and insisted it is \"safe\" for residents to return home",
      " Government agencies, like the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), have been outright dismissive at best",
      "Although US national media outlets have reported on the incident, notably absent from such reports have been the widespread alarm and panic that have dictated the tone of stories over the so-called \"spy balloon\" and unidentified objects over the past few days",
      " Despite the incident in Ohio being an environmental disaster, it certainly hasn't been depicted or approached like one",
      "But had such an event occurred in China, would the US mainstream media's response been the same? Would coverage have been moderate and calm, and would attempts to play it down or retain calm been accepted by major US news outlets? The answer is no",
      " Instead, the story would have received wall-to-wall international coverage for the space of weeks which would seek to whip up paranoia, suspicion, fear, resentment, anger and score political points against the Chinese government, who would be branded as culpable",
      "Western media reporting of China is subject to surreal levels of sensationalism, outright bias and political agenda pushing",
      " In particular, every small thing which can be interpreted as a mistake, a sign of things going wrong, or an opportunity to attack or undermine the government, is whipped up wholesale and approached by the Western media with the worst possible conclusions, with no objective balance or concern for the other side of the story",
      " In conclusion, no matter what the event is, it is always China's leadership and political system which are ultimately to blame",
      "The way the Western media presented China's response to the COVID outbreak, from day one, offers a case study into how the Western media and governments would respond had such a chemical disaster occurred in China",
      " First of all, the spill would be given wall-to-wall coverage by Western media outlets, it wouldn't be muted, but it would be expressed as were the first cases in Wuhan, as a total disaster which is caused by some aspect of inferiority in China's governance system",
      " The logic that such things \"could not happen here\" would be applied",
      "Next, the coverage would subsequently accuse China of waging a \"cover up",
      "\" While US government agencies such as EPA can downplay the chemical spill without any scrutiny, the Western mainstream media would actively accuse China of suppressing and downplaying information",
      " China would be accused of \"hiding the true extent\" in terms of environmental damage and death tolls, and would cite a number of unfounded rumors, gossip and speculation as \"evidence\" of this",
      " To match this, government bodies such as the US State Department would also publicly call for investigations, and use phrases such as \"China lacks transparency",
      "\"Following that, the US, both in terms of media and officials, would then use the disaster to try and undermine China's relationships with other countries",
      " They would claim that the impact has affected other countries too, in a similar way they weaponized COVID, and of course the weather balloons",
      " These narratives would also be matched by many op-eds appearing in Western media outlets which would directly attack and implicate China's political system to blame, making arguments which of course are ideological",
      "However, because this happened in the US, one can see that the media narrative is very different",
      " There is no induced mass panic, there is no call for accountability and no political attacks drawn from it, although we should be open to the fact it may become a partisan line of attack if the aftermath continues to escalate",
      " Likewise, in a similar vain to COVID, while the media attacked China relentlessly across every stage of the pandemic, seemingly there was little interest in the 1 million plus death toll brought about by government negligence in the US",
      "This creates an irony that while the US calls for accountability, democracy and freedom in China, they have little appetite in taking the concerns of their own people seriously, this raises in question the actual effectiveness and nature of American democracy, whereby the government can harm its own people with absolute impunity",
      " There is one rule for the US, and another for China",

      " During the Spring Festival, Xichang received more than 100,000 tourists a day during the peak period",
      " Photo: VCGThe current COVID-19 epidemic wave in China is nearing its end, and the virus did not rebound significantly during the Spring Festival holidays, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Chinese CDC) said recently",
      "This is to say that in the aftermath of the infection surge in December, China has achieved a breakthrough",
      "The Chinese Lunar New Year that has just passed created a new market boom, with tourism and box office revenues outshining those of last year",
      " The Spring Festival holidays have always been an important window for the outside world to observe the tendency of China's domestic consumer market, and this year is even more special",
      " As the first Spring Festival holidays after China optimized and adjusted its COVID policy, international organizations, observers from all walks of life, and market traders are eager to get a feel of the strength of China's economy from various data",
      "Over the last three years, China's COVID death rate has undoubtedly been much lower than its counterparts in the US and Europe",
      " China has successfully avoided the fiercest period of the epidemic and achieved a smooth transition",
      "Since China optimized its COVID-19 policy in December, some of the US and Western media outlets have waged a public opinion offensive against China",
      " Even until two weeks ago, pieces of this kind could be widely seen",
      " Yet in recent days, such articles have remarkably waned and their arguments have become much weaker",
      "Facts speak louder than speculations",
      " The fresh attempts by some US and Western media outlets to badmouth China by virtue of the latter's optimization of COVID response have already backfired",
      " The recent changes in these US and Western media's reports demonstrate that China has achieved a smooth transition, and their recent smears don't hold water",
      "The whole world has witnessed a surge in population flow during the Spring Festival holidays, as well as a boom in tourism consumption",
      " And another COVID surge after the Lunar New Year travel rush which some US and Western media predicted did not take place",
      " On Sunday, when most Chinese returned to work after the holidays, The Guardian published an article repeating the clich\u00e9 that \"After three years of lockdowns, the country was ill prepared for its abrupt 'freedom",
      "'\"The US and Western media have a consistent bias against China, which determines that their interpretation of all China-related topics, including the epidemic, cannot be objective and impartial",
      "As Washington has long regarded China as a top adversary, some of its media outlets, as well as the media of the US' Western allies, have to coordinate with their governments' political warfare against China, in a bid to create momentum in public opinion and impair China's international image, notably in the field of handling the epidemic",
      " These media are short of basic conscience and professionalism",
      "\"China's official data lacks transparency\" has been an old trick and rhetoric these media accustomed to play",
      " When claiming that the current COVID-19 epidemic wave in China is nearing its end, the Chinese CDC cited a load of statistics",
      " It cannot be ruled out that these media will once again accuse these data of not being true",
      "\"China's response to the COVID-19 has still been the best across the world, but this is something these media are reluctant to see",
      " As a response, they rack their brains to cover up their governments' incompetence, or rationalize their incapacity",
      " Claiming that China's data lacks transparency is just one of such bids,\" said L\u00fc Xiang, an expert on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences",
      "In the past three years, the Chinese government has adopted responsible policies and measures, done its upmost and made crucial contributions to protect the lives and health of the Chinese people, promote global solidarity to fight the pandemic, and push for the recovery of the global economy",
      " In terms of fighting against the epidemic, China has delivered a satisfactory answer sheet",
      "China has achieved a smooth transition in the current COVID-19 epidemic",
      " Both the dynamic zero-COVID policy and China's rapid pass of the infection peak in just more than one month can be seen as triumph",
      "Whatever the US and Western media slander, China's achievements in fighting the epidemic cannot be erased",
      " Rhetoric that ignores China's three-year anti-epidemic achievements and its contribution to the world and badmouthing China by discrediting its anti-epidemic efforts will not change the confidence of the international community in China",
      " It is believed that the year 2023 will usher in economic recovery and that the prosperity prior to the COVID-19 epidemic will soon return to China",

      " The US continued its passive and conservative stance over rule-making on light weapons and ammunition, opposed those proposals",

      "cn/Photo by Qin Qianjiang)Multiple major Chinese military aircraft manufacturers have announced completion of their annually scheduled production plans by the end of December, which will lay a solid foundation for the aviation forces of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) next year",
      "With an aircraft completing its last test flight objective and delivered to its user on Tuesday, Shaanxi Aircraft Industry (Group) Corp wrapped up its production and test flight mission for 2022, read a release the company published on its social media platform on Tuesday",
      "Compared with 2021, the company delivered twice as many aircraft, setting a new record, the company said",
      "The Shaanxi-based company is known as the manufacturer of China's special mission aircraft, including the KJ-500 early warning aircraft, the Y-8 anti-submarine patrol aircraft and the Y-8 electronic warfare aircraft",
      "With its last newly produced aircraft of the year completing test flights on Monday, Shenyang Aircraft Co also announced the completion of its annual production and test flight mission on its social media platform on Monday",
      "Honored as the cradle of Chinese fighter jets, the Shenyang Aircraft Co produces China's main combat aircraft including the J-15 carrier-based fighter jet, the J-16 multirole fighter jet and the FC-31 stealth fighter jet",
      "Other aircraft makers, including the Xi'an Aircraft Industry Group Co, which builds the Y-20 large transport aircraft and H-6 series bombers, the Harbin Aircraft Industry Group Co, which builds the Z-9 and Z-20 utility helicopters, as well as the Changhe Aircraft Industry (Group) Corp, which builds the Z-8 transport helicopter and the Z-10 attack helicopter, announced that they had wrapped up annual production on their social media accounts in late December",
      "The Chengdu Aircraft Industrial (Group) Co, which builds the J-20 stealth fighter jet, had yet to make a similar announcement as of press time, possibly due to heavy demand, but it is expected to make it in the last days of the year, observers said",
      "The Chinese aviation industry has been playing a vital role in supporting the modernization of the PLA, and as the PLA is expected to continue its rapid development in the coming year, deliveries of new aircraft are crucial, a Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Wednesday",
      "New aircraft will replace old ones and expand the whole modernized fleet, the expert said",

      " Illustration: Liu Rui/GTThe US and Japan have once again released a \"sounding balloon\" on the deployment of medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) to US forces in Japan",
      " Japanese media recently quoted sources saying that Washington has proposed to deploy such missiles in Japan as part of a plan to strengthen \"defense against China",
      "\" The report also noted that the deployment could include long-range hypersonic weapons and Tomahawk cruise missiles",
      " It then claimed that Tokyo is poised to start serious discussions about accepting the deployment and considering the island of Kyushu, which is near the island of Taiwan, as a possible location",
      " Obviously, this news is not just baseless rumors, but an attempt from Washington and Tokyo to explore the way ahead for such a significant military escalation",
      "Just over 10 days ago, the White House vowed no plans to deploy MRBMs in Japan",
      " This is not because the US does not want to do so, but precisely because the resistance is so great that it has to be scrupulous",
      " In recent years, Washington has been eager to build a missile network against China along the first island chain",
      " But Washington has been struggling to find the \"dupe\" willing to accept its MRBMs, because such an action is equivalent to covering oneself with detonators, becoming a \"body shield\" for the US military",
      " As a result, the US continues to test the reaction of other countries by giving out relevant information",
      " For instance, there was a piece of news before claiming that the deployment might be in Japan, South Korea, Australia, or the Philippines",
      " However, Seoul, Canberra, and Manila have flatly rejected it, leaving no room for such a possibility",
      " Clearly, it is not difficult to weigh the possible gains and losses",
      "Tokyo has not made a public statement on this matter, but its posture of utterly complying with Washington has given the US an opportunity to increase pressure on Japan",
      " Back in 2020, some US officials called Japan one of the potential sites for the deployment of MRBMs, and Japan was the only country publicly named by the US",
      " It is easy to see that Washington simply does not care, despite the strong opposition from the Japanese society to this news",
      " In other words, Tokyo basically has little say in front of the powerful US",
      " What is even more unbelievable is that many Japanese right-wing politicians have become lobbyists for Washington, persuading their own people that the deployment of the missiles is \"absolutely necessary\" and even said they want to \"actively request the US to do so",
      "\" Such a type of self-denigration is almost unprecedented in today's world",
      "If Tokyo insists on deploying the US military's MRBMs on Japanese soil, it will undoubtedly burn its own country's future into flames",
      " This means that once an armed conflict occurs in relevant waters, these bases will be the first main targets",
      " Due to Japan's terrain and the characteristics of land-based intermediate missiles, they can be quickly located and have a high probability of being destroyed in the first round of strikes",
      " Deploying medium-range missiles at several points cannot enhance Japan's so-called \"deterrence capability,\" but will instead make it feel the intense pain of burning itself in the first place",
      " As for the US, since it is Japan that is being beaten anyway, and the mainland of the US is hundreds of thousands of miles away, this is simply a lucrative business",
      "Now American and Japanese politicians are frequently talking about the Taiwan question, trying to hype up the \"China threat\" to trick the Japanese society into accepting this dirty political deal",
      " But history has repeatedly proved that where the US medium-range missiles are deployed, the fuses of the detonators are placed",
      "During the Cold War, the US and the Soviet Union competed to intensively deploy medium-range missiles on the European continent, which aroused strong concerns and opposition from European countries",
      " In particular, due to the short flight time of MRBMs, they are generally regarded as the trigger of a nuclear war",
      " It was under the suffocating shadow of the nuclear war that the US and the Soviet Union finally signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty)",
      " After the Trump administration announced its withdrawal from the INF Treaty in 2019, European countries reacted most strongly",
      " It is no longer the era of bipolar hegemony, but some Japanese politicians want to repeat the same mistakes in East Asia",
      " This is short-sighted and stupid",
      "In recent years, the US and Japan have released information on the deployment of medium-range missiles several times",
      " The relevant news, true or false, has been circulating for several years",
      " It's hard not to be suspicious that it is the exhaustion tactics of the US and Japan in attempt to make the region gradually acquiesce to the \"fact\" of the deployment of MRBMs, so as to reduce the impact when they are really deployed one day",
      "But the attitude of countries in the region, including China, is very firm and clear, and there is no need for Washington and Tokyo to try to test it out",
      " On this issue, no matter how many \"sounding balloons\" the US and Japan send out, it will not help",
      " Japan should particularly be cautious and not tie the US military's \"detonators\" to itself",

      " Photo: Ministry of Foreign AffairsWang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, will visit France, Italy, Hungary and Russia from February 14 to 22",
      " He will also attend the 59th Munich Security Conference (MSC) and deliver a speech at the China session",
      " During his trip, Wang will hold meetings with leaders of multiple countries",
      " He is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit Europe since the 20th CPC National Congress",
      " The outside world and international public opinion are paying close attention to this trip",
      "The MSC focuses on Europe, themed on regional security",
      " Traditionally, the MSC's agenda focuses on transatlantic partnership, and it is often regarded as an important platform to demonstrate Western solidarity, therefore it is also called the \"transatlantic family meeting",
      "\" A special feature of this year's MSC is that it is being held right before the first anniversary of the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " When the MSC concluded last year, there had been no gunshots at the Ukraine-Russia border, and most Europeans did not believe military conflicts would return to Europe",
      " For them, the world has changed a lot in the past year",
      "In order to avoid becoming a forum for internal exchanges between Europe and the US, the MSC this year has invited more delegations from emerging economies to participate in the conference",
      " The report before the meeting revealed that MSC aims to \"contribute to the peaceful resolution of conflicts",
      "\" This should be the real thinking of the organizers",
      " At the same time, it also conveyed the voice of hoping to be an occasion for China-US dialogue rather than confrontation",
      " It should be said that this is in line with China's consistent position",
      " China participates in the MSC with goodwill of peace and sincerity of cooperation, which reflects the mission and open-mindedness driven by the sense of responsibility of a major country",
      "Leaders of more than 40 countries and more than 90 ministerial officials will attend MSC this year",
      " The international mainstream media set up their cameras early and waited for them",
      " They pay special attention to two things: First, what views will the Chinese delegation expresses on major security issues of general international concern",
      " Second, which countries will Chinese side interact with and will they meet with delegates of the US? To some extent, the expectation for a meeting between Chinese and American delegates in Munich is also a projection of European uncertainty about the security situation on China-US relations, and behind it is the expectation that China-US relations will stabilize",
      "The question is, will the US act as what Europe wants? As MSC's long-time spoiler, the US is increasingly showing a tendency to overwhelm the host",
      " The outside world has noticed that the US and NATO want to turn the MSC into a self-talking, self-fulfilling internal meeting of the Western world",
      " Different from an ideological preaching and hegemonic intimidation against non-Western countries, Europe has its own views and position on MSC, as well as the international security situation and governance system",
      "Judging from past experience, Chinese delegate's expression on China's position on major international issues at the MSC were widely heard and often received a lot of understanding and support",
      " The sharp decline in the security situation in Europe over the past year has further proved the great value of Global Security Initiative proposed by China",
      " Insisting on the security concept that is common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable is a fundamental solution to solving the security dilemma in Europe",
      " It believes Europeans can see this as long as they are not biased",
      " It is conceivable that, against this special background, China's voice at the MSC this year will receive more attention",
      " Such direct communication and exchange will help to enhance trust and dispel misgivings between China and the West",
      "The Russia-Ukraine conflict has lasted for a year, and to be honest, all parties are exhausted as Europeans are yearning for peace",
      " While the US continues to fuel the flames, China has always held high the banner of promoting peace and facilitating talks",
      " China and Europe share common interests and language in this regard",
      " Against the background of US' continuous pressure piled on Europe, for the Chinese delegation, what awaits them may not necessarily be all flowers and red carpets, to which we have a clear understanding",
      " But China still sent senior diplomats to visit Europe and participate in the conference, which is enough to show our strategic courage and strategic steadiness, as well as the determination to advance cooperation through talks",
      " No matter how the US sow discord, China and Europe have broad convergence of interests",
      " It is an objective reality that cannot be changed or avoided",
      "If Europe really wants to turn the MSC to an event that promotes peace and solve conflict, then they must pay real attention to the voices of Chinese delegation and pragmatically conduct dialogue with Chinese side",
      " China and Europe share many similar views on international order, and there is no fundamental conflict of interest",
      " Empowering China-Europe relations the maximum lasting strength to resist external interference is particularly important to both China-Europe ties and the whole world",

      " A picture released by the Danish Defence Command shows the gas leak at the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline seen from the Danish F-16 interceptor on Bornholm, Denmark on September 27, 2022",
      " The two Nord Stream gas pipelines linking Russia and Europe have been hit by unexplained leaks, raising suspicions of sabotage",
      " Photo: AFPAbout five months after the explosion of the Nord Stream gas pipelines which shocked the world, an article by veteran US investigative journalist Seymour Hersh has accused the US of being the culprit of the blasts",
      "Washington has denied the accusations without further explanation, but the article immediately prompted a fierce verbal confrontation between the US and Russia and making waves in geopolitics",
      "Given previous US behaviors, Chinese experts believe that the Hersh report is highly credible and Washington's denial cannot hinder Russia's determination to dig out more evidence from the report's value as a clue",
      "Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday urged the US to give an explanation over its role in 2022 explosion of the Nord Stream gas pipelines",
      " \"The White House must now comment on all these facts,\" Zakharova said in a post on her Telegram page",
      "In response, White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said on Wednesday that the investigative article was \"utterly false and complete fiction,\" and the CIA and Pentagon also dismissed the allegation with similar rhetoric, according to media reports",
      "Hersh, an 85-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner, published the article on his personal website on Wednesday, stating the US military involvement of sabotaging the Nord Stream gas pipelines after senior White House officials' nine-month long plot inside the national security community",
      "Citing sources with direct knowledge of the plot, the article revealed many details of the operation: Explosives were planted by US Navy divers under the cover of the NATO maritime exercise; and a surveillance plane of NATO member Norway triggered the explosives on September 26, 2022 after US President Joe Biden greenlighted the operation",
      "Although there's no final verdict on who was responsible, the US, NATO, as well as investigators from Sweden and Denmark agreed it was \"a result of sabotage",
      "\"Finding smoking gunSome US media had blamed Russia as the likely culprit soon after the Nord Stream explosion in September 2022, but Hersh wrote that political elites from his country has more incentives to destroy the pipeline regarding their words prior to the incident",
      "On February 7, 2022, US President Joe Biden threatened that \"if Russian tanks or troops cross the border of Ukraine, there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2",
      "\"At a press conference in September 2022 about the consequences of the worsening energy crisis in Western Europe, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested halting Nord Stream is a \"tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy\" and stop Russia from \"weaponizing energy\" for political purposes",
      "If Biden were an ordinary citizen, and a tube explosion had happened somewhere in the US after Biden made those threats, his words would have been interpreted by the US procurator as a strong motive, and Biden would bear legal liability,L\u00fc Xiang, an expert on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "Hersh proved his credibility in his investigations on the 1969 massacre of Vietnamese civilians by US forces and US troops brutalizing Iraqi prisoners after the US invasion in 2003, which prompted L\u00fc to believe in his latest investigation of the North Stream pipeline explosion",
      "\"Even if it's not 100 percent accurate - exposure of such shady activity can hardly be 100 percent accurate - it's definitely not made up out of nowhere,\" L\u00fc noted",
      "As of press time, US mainstream media including The New York Times and The Washington Post maintained silence on the matter, which is qualified to be top on a US newspaper's front page",
      "L\u00fc suspected the consistent silence was a sound coordination between the US media and the US government, and the strategy is to deny it and wipe it from news portals even if their smoking gun was caught",
      "Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday that as the US had used washing powder to accuse Iraq of possessing weapons of mass destruction, it's a genius of playing dirty",
      "Hersh's courage should be praised, yet analysts expressed concerns about his safety",
      "It is obvious that the US benefited most from the destroyed pipelines",
      " \"If the US was behind the sabotage, definitely the Americans would have carefully planned how to destroy or hide the evidence and mislead the public,\" Li said",
      "L\u00fc said that without an entity in legal sense to be in charge of such international disputes, it is almost impossible to establish a legal fact even if more evidence further support the point that the US was the culprit",
      " But this investigative report will strengthen Russia's determination to dig out more evidence, he said",
      "Reactions to the blasts by some Western leaders also added to suspicion of US, including then British Prime Minister Liz Truss' texting \"it's done\" to Blinken and former Polish foreign minister's tweet \"Thank you, USA",
      "\"In January 2023, Russia blamed that Sweden and Denmark, who were investigating holes in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, \"have something to hide\" and blocked Russia from engaging in the joint investigation",

      " It is also tragic that as the Russia-Ukraine conflict intensifies, Europe has less and less room to bargain with US on security issues,\" Li said",

      "The US ambition to dominate Europe is strong, as it is not willing to make any compromise on European security issues, which means that it will be difficult for the MSC to achieve an ideal result, namely a constructive solution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a rational view of the current international security situation, Li said",

      "At the same time, analysts do not rule out the possibility that the US will bind China and Russia together and link the Ukraine crisis with the situation across the Taiwan Straits during the conference and put pressure on China",
      "The MSC is actually an opportunity for China to refute and correct the US narrative, Cui Hongjian said",
      "China and Russia have different diplomatic cultures and political principles when looking at and dealing with changes in the international landscape and regional hotspot issues",

      " It is totally different in nature from the Ukraine crisis and cannot be compared, Cui said",

      " US Ukraine crisis Illustration: Liu Rui/GTAs the Russia-Ukraine conflict is about to enter a second year, prospects of a truce or peace are still gloomy, Chinese analysts commented on Tuesday",
      " They said that the conflict is in fact a hybrid war staged by the US aiming to ultimately weaken and dismember Russia, with Ukraine, the unfortunate proxy and the direct victim, hardly having any say about its own fate",
      "Addressing the General Assembly in New York on Monday, United Nation (UN) Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said that he fears the likelihood of further escalation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict means the world is heading toward a \"wider war",
      "\"\"The prospects for peace keep diminishing",
      " The chances of further escalation and bloodshed keep growing,\" Guterres said",
      "China's Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Dai Bing remarked at the UN Security Council briefing on Monday that conflicts on the ground show no signs of easing up, the logic of military solution still prevails, and a large number of heavy weapons keep pouring into the battlefields",
      " The international community deplores the humanitarian cost of the conflict",
      " But the parties concerned lack the sincerity to promote peace talks and the determination to resolve the issue politically",
      "Despite the international community crying for peace, the US has revealed plans to reinforce Ukraine's defense in the long-term perspective, media cited US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Monday",
      "\"We are thinking not just about today's fight, but about the future capacity for Ukraine to defend itself and deter Russian aggression down the road,\" Sullivan said at a virtual conference on Monday",
      " He effectively confirmed that the US is considering shipment of F-16 planes and other complex weapons to Kiev at some point",
      "\"It is not surprising the US is playing the long game and it will not call a truce until it achieves its goal of weakening and dismembering Russia",
      " However, in the process, Ukraine will inevitably become the biggest victim, and Europe, abducted by the US strategy driven by Cold War mentality, is paying the second worst price,\" Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday",
      "Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the US has benefited from the conflict - weakening Russia while strengthening its control over Europe - and also made quite awesome gains by selling energy, weapons and grains",
      " No wonder the US wants the conflict to continue",
      "As the conflict prolongs, European assets would be forced to flee to the US, helping the US to rein in inflation and secure the dollar hegemony; while in the political terms, the conflict has become US President Joe Biden's political assets and would be a useful part of his campaign for the 2024 elections, Cui said",
      "The US, despite gaining short-term profits from energy and arms trade, will eventually lose, as the international community has increasingly noticed the untrustworthy nature of the US hegemony",
      " De-dollarization and de-hegemony have become more and more a global consensus, Song said",
      "More political showBiden, claiming to show support for Ukraine, is scheduled to visit Poland, which neighbors Ukraine, at the end of February to mark the anniversary of the conflict which broke out on February 24, 2022, NBC News reported on Tuesday",
      "The first anniversary will be a perfect timing for shrewd politicians like Biden to put on a political show, Chinese analysts said",
      " But taking sides between Ukraine and Russia won't help solve the problem, as the nature of the conflict is a US-staged hybrid war targeting Russia with Ukraine as the proxy",
      "The European Council has also invited Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to attend an EU summit in Brussels on February 9-10",
      "Inviting Zelensky to the summit is clearly to further appease Ukraine after previous fruitless talks dashed Ukraine's hope for a quick EU membership, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday",
      "Zelensky will no doubt take the February summit as a stage for his political show and reiterate his sincerity of joining the EU",
      " However, the old Europe such as France and Germany would unlikely play along, for fear of irritating Russia and losing a wiggle room, Cui Heng said",
      "Turkey, which has been making efforts to join the EU since 1987, would also be upset if Ukraine, a country far from meeting the Copenhagen criteria for membership, could join the EU so soon, Cui Heng explained",
      "Cui Hongjian warned that if the US-led West keeps providing military aid to Ukraine, there would be no foundation for diplomatic negotiations",
      "Overall military support from the EU to Ukraine is estimated at around 12 billion euros ($13",
      "1 billion)",
      " Overall assistance to Ukraine pledged by the EU and individual member state amounts to nearly 50 billion euros ($54",
      "5 billion) so far, according to data from the EU website",
      "What China can do is to push forward the direct dialogues between the US and Russia in a bilateral or multilateral framework, which could provide key ground for peace talks to resolve the conflict, Cui Hongjian said",

      " A black plume rises over East Palestine, Ohio, as a result of a controlled detonation of a portion of the derailed Norfolk and Southern trains Monday, Feb",
      " 6, 2023",
      "Photo: VCGOn February 3, a freight train carrying hazardous chemicals, including vinyl chloride, crashed and exploded in East Palestine, Ohio, USA",
      " This sparked a fire that lasted for several days and could not be safely put out by authorities, so they resorted to a controlled burn that released toxic chemicals into the air",
      " This issue has received virtually no national media attention despite the high stakes",
      "However, the derailment has spurred fear among nearby residents, even after the area was declared safe, over long-term exposure risks to these chemicals",
      " Local media reports pointed to sick children and animals dying in the surrounding region",
      " And experts have expressed concern over dioxins, which are persistent and do not dissipate in the air",
      "There are also concerns that chemicals could have gotten into the nearby Ohio River, which could affect people in a vast swath of the country, including my hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio",
      " For me, this issue is a bit personal because it could put my friends and family in danger of rare forms of cancer, or other illnesses",
      "The disaster has spawned a flurry of anger toward local and federal officials",
      " For instance, blame has been put on Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg because his department, as The Lever reports, \"has not moved to reinstate an Obama-era rail safety rule aimed at expanding the use of better braking technology",
      "\" That is in spite of the fact that a former federal safety official recently warned Congress that without better brakes, \"there will be more derailments [and] more releases of hazardous materials",
      "\"Instead of this, federal regulators have mulled a proposal backed by the rail lobby that would weaken existing brake safety rules",
      " Notably, Buttigieg does not have any expertise in transportation and was essentially a vanity political appointee by the administration of President Joe Biden to help boost his political score",
      " The secretary faced scrutiny recently over mass flight cancellations during the holiday season, as well, with many pointing to his lack of relevant experience",
      "As well, local officials have also been criticized for their handling of the event",
      " A NewsNation correspondent named Evan Lambert was actually arrested at a press conference held by Ohio state authorities about the crash, raising concerns about freedom of speech and a lack of accountability",
      "Andy Boreham, a New Zealand journalist based in China, pointed out that the transportation of vinyl chloride in general is an anomaly that indicates a lack of essential regulations",
      " He notes that in China, for example, this disaster could not have happened",
      " According to him, the chemical is not transported at all \"because China has implemented a system whereby vinyl chloride is made LOCALLY from calcium carbide, which is much safer to transport",
      "\"\"That means that in China, vinyl chloride - the substance which has caused the massive environmental disaster in Ohio, USA - is not transported",
      " It has been known for many years that vinyl chloride is extremely dangerous, not just to humans and animals, but also the wider environment,\" he concluded",
      "The entire issue surrounding the train derailment appears to be a massive corruption scandal, whereby corporations are dictating policies that impact the lives of millions of people - and put them at significant risk",
      " As stated before, relevant officials have stated to Congress that there will be more trail derailments without regulation",
      " Instead, we have a politically convenient, unqualified appointment sat in the highest position on this issue, who refuses to regulate the rail lobby",
      "We have actually already seen the power of this industry",
      " At the end of last year, workers from some of the most extensive freight lines threatened a national strike that would have crippled the economy",
      " But their demands were extraordinarily basic: paid sick leave, not being on call 24/7, not being forced to conduct trains alone and a decent wage",
      " Instead, the Biden administration forced a skinny deal on workers on behalf of the rail lobby",
      "That Americans are essentially controlled by such interests is fundamentally unjust and inherently anti-democratic",
      " It means that our basic livelihoods and safety are controlled by large cartels with no public accountability",
      " And they own all our elected officials, meaning there is no way to impose regulations on them at even a basic level",
      " This is not simply limited to the rail industry, but extends to the entire economy, as Americans enjoy far fewer consumer and environmental protections than peer countries",

      " China-US Photo: GTAt the request of the US side, China's top diplomat Wang Yi held an unofficial engagement with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday local time on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Germany, where the Chinese official urged the US side to rectify its wrong approach as Washington's handling of the recent airship incident has damaged China-US relations",
      "Chinese observers believe that from the readout of the US state department, Washington has barely displayed any sincerity in fixing the US-China relations, which have been further damaged by its hysterical overreaction and abuse of force in handling the recent Chinese balloon incident",
      " It also reflects that the Biden administration has little flexibility in its China policy amid a toxic domestic political environment in the US",
      "Such an unofficial, short engagement is a sign of the tough situation the two countries are facing now, observers said, who predict that tensions in the bilateral relations are unlikely to ease in the short term, especially when the US is entering an election cycle",
      "Wang, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, stated China's solemn position on the airship incident, and told Blinken that the US should face up to and resolve the damage inflicted on bilateral relations after the US abused its force and shot down a Chinese unmanned civilian airship that strayed into US airspace due to force majeure, according to a statement on the website of the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Sunday",
      "On Saturday, Wang blasted Washington's reaction to the balloon incident, calling its handling of the matter \"hysterical,\" and an apparent violation of international norms and conventions",
      "It is the US who is in fact the number one country in terms of surveillance and reconnaissance, whose high-altitude balloons illegally flew over China multiple times",
      " The US is in no position to smear China, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Sunday in a comment on the Wang-Blinken interaction",
      "What the US needs to do is demonstrate sincerity and face up to and resolve the damage that its abuse of force has done to China-US relations",
      " If the US continues to dramatize, hype up or escalate the situation, China will surely respond by doing what is necessary",
      " All consequences arising thereof shall be borne by the US side, the spokesperson said",
      "Christoph Heusgen, Chairman of the Munich Security Conference, delivers his closing statement at the Security Conference on February 19, 2023 in Munich, Germany",
      " The 59th Munich Security Conference (MSC) took place from February 17 to 19, 2023",
      " Photo:VCGNo sincerityIn a summary of the meeting in Munich, Ned Price, a spokesperson for the US State Department, said Blinken \"directly spoke to the unacceptable violation of US sovereignty and international law by the [People's Republic of China] high-altitude surveillance balloon in US territorial airspace, underscoring that this irresponsible act must never again occur",
      "\"\"The US appears to have been proactive in seeking dialogue with China, but it has not showed any sincerity, nor reflection on the solutions to deal with the issue,\" L\u00fc Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times, on Sunday",
      "Following the balloon incident, Blinken announced to postpone his first official trip to China, US media reported in early February",
      " The Chinese side had not confirmed this visit",
      " Despite China repeatedly explained to the US that the Chinese civilian airship flew into the US airspace due to force majeure, Blinkensaid in an interview with NBC scheduled to be aired on Sunday that the US had not overreacted in shooting it down, adding that \"there was no doubt that the device's aim was to carry out surveillance activities,\" Reuters said",
      "\"Previously, China and the US could expect to 'sit down and talk,' but under the current atmosphere of China-US relations, they could 'only stand and talk,'\" L\u00fc said, noting that Washington still shows no good will to promote a proper settlement of the issue",
      "The balloon incident was mentioned in at least three public occasions during the MSC, including when Wang met Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto, when he responded to questions about China-US relations following his keynote speech, and when he met Blinken informally",
      " The Chinese diplomat stated China's solemn position on the matter, and even asked, \"there are many balloons floating above the Earth every day, is the US going to shoot them all down?\" From the information released and the readouts of the two sides, some Chinese observers said although holding the conversation is better than no dialogue at all, as it will help reduce concerns over instability rising globally, it is hard to believe the two sides would reach any consensus",
      "\"China has made clear that it wants the US side to change course, which reveals that unless the US changes its provocative policy toward China, China-US relations are unlikely to get back on track,\" Sun Chenghao, a research fellow from the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "Dim prospects?Besides the balloon incident, the US Secretary of State also pointed the finger at China-Russia relations",
      " Blinken told the US media that China is \"considering providing lethal support to Russia\" while warning the Chinese diplomat that \"there would be consequences if China provides material support to Russia or assistance with systemic sanctions evasion",
      "\"On the Ukraine issue, China adheres to principles and stays committed to promoting peace talks, and has been playing a constructive role",
      " The China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination is built on the basis of non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting of third countries, and is within the sovereign rights of two independent countries, Wang told Blinken, according to readout of Chinese foreign ministry",
      "\"We never accept the US' finger-pointing or even coercion targeting China-Russia relations",
      " The US, as a major country, is supposed to work for a political settlement of the crisis instead of fanning the flames or profiteering from the situation,\" Wang said",
      "\"The so-called warning to China is unreasonable, reckless and meaningless, which won't play any constructive role on the matter,\" L\u00fc said",
      "During the unofficial engagement, Wang urged the US side to respect history and the facts on the Taiwan question, abide by political commitments, and act upon the statement of \"not supporting Taiwan independence",
      "\"Some observers believe that Blinken's visit to China, if goes ahead, is expected to slightly ease the US-China relations, which have been further worsening in recent years, but the postponement of Blinken's visit announced by the US following the balloon incident makes the prospects of recovery in bilateral relations dim",
      "\"Although Washington has not announced to cancel Blinken's reported visit, it will be difficult for China-US relations to stabilize in the coming months,\" Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "In a few months, the US will enter the election cycle",

      " Illustration:Liu Rui/GTThe EU is planning to hit back at the US' Inflation Reduction Act by easing restrictions to allow a wave of tax credits for green investment, reports show",
      " EU members have been vigilant toward the Inflation Reduction Act ever since it was unveiled",
      " The next question is, where will the EU's own version of the Act go?There are three obvious characteristics of the EU's counter proposal",
      " First, it is a direct hit back against the US",
      " Second, it is a passive countermove by the EU",
      " Third, it can be expected to be resilient",
      "EU's plan to relax state-aid rules to support investment in green sectors is similar to that of the US",
      " On the surface, it looks like an approach to cut inflation, but it is in fact a competition in new-energy sector between the EU and the US",
      " At first, the US' act was aimed at China",
      " However, the EU soon realized its interests in new-energy vehicles would be severely hurt",
      " So before other countries were able to react, it stood up to confront the US",
      " Yet, the move is still passive",
      "Although being a passive reaction, the EU's version of Inflation Reduction Act can still have strong resilience after it is introduced",
      "The EU has a huge market size and cultural traditions for new-energy vehicles and green industries",
      " In addition, the purchasing power of the EU, including Western Europe, the Nordic countries, Southern European countries and some Central European countries, is not weak compared to American consumers",
      "The EU's green and environmental protection industry market is far ahead of that of the North American region",
      " People in European countries have adhered to the concept of green development and environmental protection for decades and put it into practice in a pragmatic manner",
      " Although North America has made progress in the field of green and environmental protection in recent years, there is still a certain gap with the EU",
      "The EU also has three shortcomings",
      " First, the technology of the EU new-energy automobile industry is still far behind and catching up with that of the US and China; second, in terms of investment in new-energy automobile and green industry, the EU has not yet been able to match the US and China; third, the EU is still a partnership among sovereign states, with a relatively loose structure and low negotiation efficiency",
      "However, if these three shortcomings are handled properly and coupled with structural reform measures, the EU has an opportunity to find a new and effective path",
      " Although the EU does not have the technological advantage of new energy, this can be hedged by its huge market size and purchasing power",
      " The political structure of the EU is also moving forward step by step, slowly but steadily, and evolving toward a more close and effective structure, or \"ever greater union",
      "\"However, the EU is in a passive state not only when it comes to the Inflation Reduction Act, but also in many other areas, the infrastructure in particular",
      " Be it the 70 overseas infrastructure projects that the EU plans to launch in the near future, or the EU's plan to invest more than \u20ac280 million in grants in South Africa, under the Global Gateway initiative, they all have shown EU's passive state in global development",
      " The problem is rooted in its own political structure and decision-making mechanisms",
      "In short, in the face of the US' Inflation Reduction Act, it's possible that the EU will make more active counterattacks in the future",
      " Facing a strong offensive by the US; China and the EU, the two major economies, could join hands in new-energy vehicle and green environmental protection industries, so as to jointly lead the world's green and environmental protection trends",

      " Two Sessions Photo:XinhuaThe National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, on Sunday started to deliberate a draft amendment to the Legislation Law, eight years after the law was first amended in 2015",
      " The new changes highlight the implementation and oversight of the Constitution as well as promoting whole-process people's democracy to better protect human rights and social fairness and justice",
      "Summarizing the practical experience of legislative work in the new era, the proposed amendment has taken into consideration the new work methods and demand for legislation in recent years, and is expected to further improve the legislative system and mechanism, and enhance the quality and efficiency of legislation, said Wang Chen, vice chairman of the 13th NPC Standing Committee on Sunday",
      "The 37-article draft amendment covers mainly seven sectors",
      " The highlights include enhancing the implementation and oversight of the Constitution, and specifying the constitutional compliance review requirements in legislation and the record and review system for normative documents",
      "\"In the Report to the 20th National Congress of the CPC, it asked the country's legal system to step up legislation in key, emerging and foreign-related fields, and advance the rule of law in domestic and foreign-related affairs in a coordinated manner",
      " The amendment has made clearer and more specific what our tasks are in light of these requirements outlined in the report,\" Feng Yujun, a Professor of Law School at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times",
      "\"Now we have entered the \"deep-water\" stage of reform and opening-up, where a variety of challenges and risks have emerged",
      " It is impossible to follow the old rules and logics",
      " It is a reflection of the changes in concept of legal works from subject-oriented approach to problem-solving approach based on actual practices,\" Feng said",
      "Another focus of the amendment is the emphasis on whole-process people's democracy, which \"should be upheld and developed during the legislative process,\" according to the Xinhua News Agency",
      " It also proposes to codify the requirement of respecting and protecting human rights in the legislative work",
      "Ahead of the opening of the session, Wang Chao, spokesperson for the first session of the 14th NPC, noted that efforts have been made during the revision of the law to make sure that every link in the legislative process reflects the people's voices and reality at the grassroots level",
      "To better hear the voices of the people, the draft stipulates that the working bodies of the Standing Committee should set up local legislative outreach offices in light of actual needs to solicit opinions from the grassroots and people from all walks of life",

      "Tang, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the chief designer of the aircraft at the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China, made the remarks when answering a question on China's large aircraft development at a press conference on Saturday",
      "2023 marks the 10th anniversary on the Y-20's maiden flight, and from its scientific research test flights to its commissioning, the large transport aircraft has achieved a number of records and has proven itself in a series of tests including several special missions, said Tang",
      "The Y-20 has flown across China, and its contrails have also reached Asia, Europe, Africa and Oceania in anti-pandemic, disaster relief and international humanitarian aid missions, attracting attentions from the international community, boosted morale of Chinese nationals and demonstrated Chinese strength, Tang said",

      " At the Airshow China 2022, the AG600 large amphibious emergency rescue aircraft and the aerial tanker variant of the Y-20 also made flight performances, and China's family of large aircraft is getting bigger, said the political advisor",
      "The development of large aircraft reflects a country's comprehensive capability, and when foreigners once asked Tang how China achieved the miracle of taking only five years to conduct the Y-20's first flight and only eight years to deliver for service, Tang replied, \"The key is self-reliance and innovation",
      "\"With the spirit of integration, innovation and dedication, China made many technological breakthroughs including digitalized design, digitalized manufacturing, simulations and coordinated network management, which also reflected technological advancements through time and high-quality development, Tang said",

      "Chinese observers believed that the US \"politics of veto\" is further decaying into a \"politics of retaliation\", where mutual attacks go beyond political views and become increasingly personal",
      " The latest round of witch-hunting, which is dragging the US Department of Justice (DOJ) into the mud, just adds to proliferating evidence that lays bare a dysfunctional US' political system",
      "A farceGarland appointed Robert Hur on Thursday to investigate Biden, who admitted that a second set of classified government documents from the Obama administration, during which Biden served as vice president, were found in a storage space in the garage of Biden's Delaware home, CNBC reported on Thursday",
      "The latest disclosure comes three days after Biden's special counsel, Richard Sauber, confirmed media reports that attorneys for the president found a first batch of classified documents from the Biden administration on November 2, 2022 in an office at a Washington think tank that Biden had used as a private citizen, according to the CNBC report",
      "The documents reportedly include intelligence involving Iran, Ukraine and the UK",
      "Garland in November 2022 appointed a special counsel to oversee the criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at former president Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort and parts of the Capitol riots on January 6, 2021",
      "CNN reported on Thursday that the special counsel investigation of Biden, along with the aggressive new Republican-led House of Representatives, means the incumbent president may be on the defensive for the next two years",
      "Republican Mike Turner of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, wrote to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines on Tuesday to ask her to conduct an immediate review and damage assessment on the first batch of Biden documents, the CNBC reported",
      "On Thursday, Republican Kevin McCarthy, who was just elected House Speaker after an embarrassing 15-round vote not seen in a century, said, \"I think Congress has to investigate this",

      " \"Even a criminal suspect can be a presidential candidate\" and it is too difficult to successfully impeach a president, the expert said",
      "Trump's situation was clearer, as he faced criminal charges and has left the post of president, while Biden's case was a bit more complicated as he is incumbent president and the documents date back to his time as vice president",
      "The DOJ has no right to question Biden, and it remains to be seen how the two \"classified documents\" cases will unfold, L\u00fc said, predicting that the investigations may \"end up nowhere",
      "\"According to Diao, there is a possibility that Democrats and Republicans will achieve a dangerous balance in this round of witch-hunting",
      "But if Republicans can dig out more, they will not let go of the opportunity to attack Biden and his administration, which will generate more uncertainty over power struggles in Washington and the 2024 presidential election, analysts said",
      "Republicans had previously outlined a broad range of investigative targets focused on President Joe Biden and his family's business dealings",
      "Comer said that in the 118th Congress, his House Oversight Committee will evaluate the status of Biden's relationship with his family's foreign partners and whether he is a President who is compromised or swayed by foreign dollars and influence, the CNN reported",

      "Diao noted that future politics in the US will not just be the \"politics of veto,\" but the \"politics of retaliation,\" which will focus on attacking each other's sense of character and ethics",
      " It's not only about political dysfunction, but also a state of utter hostility between people, Diao added",
      "Citing the recent deadlock before McCarthy's election as House Speaker, L\u00fc said that the two parties' fights are not only prolonged, but the internal divisions within each party are growing wider and wider, jointly contributing to the political polarization and radicalization",
      "Going against the greater good of the whole party, a minority of politicians prefer to maximize their own political power",

      "As chemicals fill the air and seep into the ground, food producers and consumers are asking questions about the impact of the release of these chemicals on food safety and on crops and livestock, Food Safety News reported",
      "A local farmer, Pam Mibuck, said her white turkeys have been put on antibiotics due to respiratory problems, and her chickens have laid eggs with an unsettling purple hue, the New York Times reported",
      "While Mibuck did not feel like moving from her hometown, she conceded that she does not feel safe living there anymore, as she is concerned about eating the fruit from her trees and letting her horses drink from the nearby creek",
      "Ohio has about 75,000 farms, and ranks first in the country in the production of Swiss cheese, second in egg production, and third in tomatoes and pumpkins, according to media reports",
      "Contaminated water is another major concern for food safety, as trace amounts of chemicals spilled from the train derailment have been found in the Ohio River",
      " Its basin runs into the Mississippi River, the second-longest river and chief river of the second-largest drainage system in North America",
      "Although the local environmental protection agency reiterated that water in Ohio is safe, residents say they have found dead fish near waterways in recent days",
      "Regions near the Ohio River are shutting down intakes as a \"precautionary measure for the time being,\" local news reports said",
      "\"The incident has caused great concern in China's domestic animal husbandry circles, especially when it come to the potential impact on animal feed, because the source of corn in our livestock and poultry feed is mainly from the US,\" Wang said",
      "However, the impact to the feed supply in China is controllable",
      " \"Given the fact that Ohio's corn accounts for a limited amount of corn production in the country, coupled with China's ability to detect harmful chemicals, we are not particularly worried that it will affect the domestic supply of agricultural products,\" the expert noted",
      "Moreover, China has diversified its sources of corn and soybean to include South American countries such as Argentina and Brazil in recent years",
      "Still, Wang was surprised at the way such dangerous chemicals are disposed of in the US",
      "Incineration is a very unprofessional way to deal with chemicals, since the incineration of vinyl chloride produces a large amount of dioxins, which will have a great impact on the surrounding environment, the expert said",
      "\"The harm can reach 10-20 years",
      " Such effects include its high carcinogenicity and it may cause fetal malformations,\" Wang said, adding that the excess proportion of new cancers may be difficult to measure in the short term",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/Global TimesThe UK had plenty to say when China was dealing with riots in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region more than three years ago",
      " It blamed Chinese central government for the civil unrest which caused destruction",
      "It is ironic then that while accusing China of suppressing protestors in Hong Kong, the UK itself is now being accused of repressive behavior with a slew of new laws which threaten indiscriminate persecution and prosecution for anyone who speaks out against the government there",
      "It is doubly ironic that some of the voices raised against these draconian measures are the Hong Kongers who moved to the UK after the upheaval, and who are now finding to their horror the double standards of the former imperialist autocrats",
      "The mass protests of 2019 were characterized in the West as \"pro-democracy\" gatherings ruthlessly put down by Hong Kong police",
      " British politicians attacked China and lauded the protesters - even when peaceful demonstrations descended into violence",
      "The colonial-minded legislators from the UK were indignantly critical, accusing China of stifling legitimate right to protest",
      " They even created a special visa scheme to move Hong Kongers to the UK",
      " Many have accepted, even though their status as a British National (overseas) is not the same as full British citizenship",
      " It allows the UK to appear welcoming, but without giving the right of permanent residence",
      " It is a kind of second class citizenship",
      "How strange then that some of the loudest opposition to the British government's efforts to restrict the right to protest has come from the Hong Kong diaspora in the UK",
      " The Conservative government of Rishi Sunak is proposing astonishingly harsh measures",
      " New laws could suffocate legitimate criticism of the government",
      " Crucially, the protests do not have to be violent",
      " If a demonstration becomes violent in the UK, there are already plenty of laws on the statute book to deal with it",
      " The new laws are something more sinister",
      " They can not only stop protests in progress, they permit action against anyone even suspected of planning to protest",
      " It is both Orwellian and Kafkaesque, and demonstrates the British government's double standards",
      "One law currently passing through the British parliament is the repressive Public Order Bill which would allow politicians, almost at their own whim, to issue orders preventing individuals from protesting, even if they have committed no crime",
      " The state would be able to stop them associating with certain individuals and even restrict their access to the internet",
      " The state could make them subject to reporting restrictions and electronic tagging",
      " All of this without having committed a crime",
      "Extended stop and search powers would give police arbitrary authority to waylay almost anyone they wished",
      " The government claims this is to let \"law-abiding\" people go about their daily business without interference by protesters",
      " This overlooks the fact that, having committed no crimes, the protestors themselves are \"law-abiding\" people",
      " This would have a chilling effect on protest",
      "The government has already increased its repressive anti-protest powers with the recent Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act, which allows people to be prosecuted for being too noisy",
      " For example, if someone tied their dog to a lamppost outside a shop and the animal barked until its owner returned, the pet owner could be liable",
      " Workers going on strike to protect their pay, conditions or services could be accused of law breaking",
      " The government has also changed election law to ban citizens from voting unless they have access to very limited forms of identity",
      " Laws have changed to criminalize asylum seekers, against an international treaty, and send them to Rwanda for processing",
      "The Public Order Bill is opposed not only by scores of civil rights groups, the police, fire and rescue services, and members of parliament's upper chamber, the House of Lords, who all say the measures are extreme and incompatible with defending human rights",
      " Even the international campaigning group Human Rights Watch has warned that the United Kingdom is perilously close to being listed as a \"human rights abuser\" due to its flagrant and hypocritical disregard for the protections and rights of its own citizens",
      " It makes Britain's stance on Hong Kong look a bit rich",
      "This bill and the other laws are not about preserving the peace or protecting the public from disruption",
      " They are about exercising and protecting power",
      " It is the government's disreputable response to its own overwhelming unpopularity",
      " By passing such laws, ministers hope to convey an impression of being in control when faced crises like mass discontent or the current widespread strikes",
      " It also gives politicians a legal smokescreen to persecute legitimate protestors when those protestors are speaking out against the government",
      " It is less about protecting the public and more about protecting the politicians",

      " Illustration: Chen Xian/Global TimesThere are still no indications that the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has lasted for nearly a year, is about to cease or ease",
      " Despite various appeals from the outside world, at present, the two sides lack the necessary conditions to resume substantive peace talks",
      " Furthermore, the essence of the ongoing conflict is the crisis of the European security architecture",
      " No matter how the conflict develops or when the negotiation resumes, in addition to urging the Moscow and Kiev to remain restraint and avoid further escalation, it is also necessary to explore the manner of coexistence in the future, and cogitate a new European security architecture",
      "First, any new European security architecture cannot exclude Russia",
      " The Ukraine crisis has significantly exacerbated the irreconcilability between Russia and the West in terms of strategic orientation, ideology, and development models",
      " The fact - Russia geographically belongs to Europe - is unable help it become a part of Europe in politics",
      " Yet, security issues differ from abstract political identity, as they are highly realistic and may result in irreversible consequences",
      "Looking back at history, the European continent has been devastated by war",
      " Ultimately, the symbiotic and interconnected nature of security issues determines that only when the legitimate concerns of stakeholders are responded to, can peace be realized",
      " Thus, excluding Russia, an unmovable neighbor, or blindly intensifying containment and confrontation under the rhetoric of \"Russian threat,\" is an \"ostrich effect\" that covers up the root of contradictions, which makes it difficult to resolve the crux of security dilemma",
      "Furthermore, the new European security architecture must abandon the notion of exclusivity",
      " Throughout the important documents that constitute the post-war European security architecture, the principle of \"indivisible security\" runs through it",
      " Russia once hoped to strengthen the leading position of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe",
      " However, out of the need to maintain the rationality of its own existence, NATO has continuously strengthened its awareness of exclusive security, which has led to the constant erosion of the strategic comfort level between itself and Russia",
      "Putting aside subjective political or military decisions, differences in cognition of the principle of \"indivisible security\" and the failure to integrate Russia into the European security architecture on an equal footing are the causes of this round of the Ukraine crisis, and the parties have fallen into the interactive trap of maintaining security through confrontation",
      " Hence, it is necessary to redefine the principle of \"indivisible security,\" abandon the system design based on the position of power, increase the cost of resolving security claims by force, and achieve the relative balance of the security architecture in an inclusive and cooperative manner to avoid wider conflicts caused by exclusivity of security",
      "Moreover, a new European security architecture cannot be achieved without cognitive reshaping",
      " Russia believes that it should be allowed to participate in the regional and global security architecture as an equal",
      " However, the US and Europe insist on the cognitive logic of the \"winning side\" versus the \"losing side\" of the Cold War and prioritize the weakening and containment of Russia as the direction of institution-building",
      "Be it the binary narrative of \"democracy VS authoritarianism,\" or the theory of institutional superiority, or the \"Missionary Spirit,\" none will help resolve cognitive bias between Europe and Russia",
      " Only by discarding the simple \"friend or foe\" thinking based on new geopolitical realities, comprehensively adjusting mutual cognition on each other, and showing mutual respect for core interests and concerns, can it be possible to build effective European security architecture",
      "Finally, the new European security architecture requires a long-term vision",
      " Europe is still in the phase of \"traumatic stress response\" brought about by the Ukraine crisis",
      " With Finland and Sweden starting the process of joining NATO, NATO's \"northern expansion\" will constitute the offensive and defensive frontier against Russia from the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea to the Arctic Ocean",
      " In response, Russia has accelerated the military integration of the Union State, or Union State of Russia and Belarus",
      " With the Ukraine crisis expanding and becoming protracted and complicated, the fight in the battlefield has intensified and there has been zero mutual trust between NATO and Russia",
      "But in the long run, a sustainable regional security architecture is the only way to solve the European security dilemma, and the key lies in the mutual trust building measures",
      " It is necessary to orderly rebuild multi-level security mutual trust measures and dialogue mechanisms, enhance the transparency of security policies between Europe and Russia, maintain the predictability and standardization of competition, and prevent strategic misjudgments causing the crisis to spiral out of control or sparking new conflicts",
      " Only by reaching a consensus on a new European security architecture can it be possible to break through the security dilemma caused by the Ukraine crisis",

      "With signs of a possible end to the military conflict still appearing distant, experts called to deescalate the situation before more spillovers emerge",
      " At the upcoming Munich Security Conference which will convene on February 17, China is expected to mediate and play a constructive role in promoting peace talks, experts noted",
      "At a NATO defense minister meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that Russia has already started its new \"spring offensive,\" with \"more troops, more weapons, more capabilities",
      "\"The NATO chief was referring to the intense military conflict in Bakhmut in the Donetsk region",

      "In terms of the advanced fighter jets and tanks that Kiev wants, 11 countries have agreed to send tanks to Ukraine, 22 countries have committed to send infantry fighting vehicles, while 16 nations have pledged \"artillery and munitions,\" according to US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley at Tuesday's meeting",
      "However, US officials had no announcement on providing fighter jets to Ukraine, a continuation of the White House position of refusing to send military fighters, along with UK, Germany and other allies",
      "Zhao Huirong, an Eastern European studies expert from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that the US and NATO, by hyping a Russian \"spring offensive\" and Ukraine's counterattack, are preparing for an escalation of the military conflict and rallying allies",

      "Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that in a state of stalemate and attrition, the \"spring offensive\" and \"counterattack\" may be more of a psychological contest",

      "Unlike the US, China has always stood in a neutral position, calling for all parties to resolve disputes through political negotiations, and hoping that the situation will cool down and the military conflict will end as soon as possible, Yang noted",
      "Analysts believe that the escalation and continuation of the military conflict would have a significant negative impact on Europe, Russia, Ukraine, international energy supplies, and even China's Belt and Road Initiative",
      " By contrast, the US, which has set obstacles to a peaceful political solution, is clearly the one that gains the most",

      " Photo: AFPThe recent strikes in the United Kingdom are a wake-up call for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who on Thursday marks 100 days in office",
      " It's hard to say how long he and his party can stay in power if London keeps exploiting the international situation to show its presence instead of effectively addressing the social problems at home and quelling people's growing discontent",
      "On Wednesday, around half a million teachers, civil servants, train drivers and other professions walked off their jobs over pay and conditions in the UK",
      " It is reported that this is the largest strike since 2011",
      " And GMB, one of the largest trade unions in Great Britain, announced healthcare workers in the UK, from nurses to emergency call handlers, will stage more strikes next week",
      "The UK has been facing increasingly severe livelihood crises since Brexit, with British people's living conditions getting worse",
      " The country's domestic demand has been growing relatively slowly",
      " And the ongoing Russia-Ukraine military conflict has caused a sharp rise in living costs across the West",
      " In particular, the prices of energy and food skyrocketed due to the shortage",
      "Under the influence of internal and external factors, the UK's economic development suffered a massive shock in 2022, while its general economic situation deteriorated even faster",
      " Inflation in the UK, for example, kept soaring in the first ten months of 2022, reaching a 41-year high of 11",
      "1 percent in October",
      "Although the number slightly dropped in November and December after Sunak took office in late October and implemented policies to boost the economy and lower the inflation rate, it is clear that the general public's dissatisfaction with the British government grew way faster",
      " This eventually led to the recent strikes for people to vent out their long-accumulated dissatisfaction",
      "But while facing severe problems at home, such as rising energy prices and high inflation, Britain is still sending aid to Ukraine to support it on the battlefield better",
      " Gao Jian, director of the Center for British Studies at Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times that London has its own calculations to do so",
      "\"Britain's foreign policy is now completely dependent on the US",
      " Therefore, if the UK does not present itself as a 'fighter for democracy' on matters like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, its role as a pawn in the US global strategic system will continue to be marginalized,\" he noted",
      "Moreover, London's greatest fear is now that no one will care about it after it has lost its status as a main player in international affairs",
      " As a result, the UK has to continue adopting a short-sighted approach of taking advantage of the Ukraine crisis to show its presence in the international arena",
      "Just take a look at how British politics has operated in recent years",
      " All we see is confrontation and confusion",
      " The ruling Conservative Party, representing mainly the British elite and the middle class, and the Labour Party, which represents the middle-lower classes, have been maintaining a competitive and even hostile relationship",
      " This irreconcilable conflict between them has intensified dramatically over the years",
      "And due to the close ties between the Labour Party and the unions, the Conservative Party is and will remain firmly against strikes, let alone compromise with the unions",
      " Thus, the antagonism between the unions and the British government will not be eased in any form",
      " It is anticipated that the UK will see more confrontations",
      "The UK's politics has long lost its direction, making it more difficult to solve the livelihood problems of the British people",
      " Many British politicians are busy engaging in political grandstanding and arguing and fighting their opponents in the parliament",
      " Instead, they make no effort to look for practical solutions to the country's problems",
      " At the same time, London, tightly clung to Washington, has shown a tendency to ideologize foreign affairs",
      " Such a narrow vision has greatly expended the key elements of the development of the UK",
      "We should congratulate Sunak for \"outliving\" his predecessor Liz Truss as the UK's PM",
      " But Sunak may soon come to his wit's end to find ways to stabilize British society",
      " Experts believe that at present, Sunak or the Conservative Party still risks losing the power in the country's politics",
      " However, be who is in power, under the trend where the UK keeps going downward in many aspects, no party or politician can make a significant change and save a desperate situation",

      "The Zhejiang CDC noted that as H1N1 has not been prevalent in the province for nearly three years, the local population is generally susceptible to the virus due to low vaccination rates",
      " Since China downgraded its COVID-19 management on January 8, the increased flow of people and gatherings have also made it easier for the virus to spread, according to the Zhejiang CDC",
      "Moreover, the Zhejiang CDC stated that during the transition from winter to spring, when influenza is prevalent, the risk of cluster outbreaks in crowded areas persists",

      " Influenza B, on the other hand, only accounts for 1 percent",
      "Zhang Daitao, Director of the Institute for Infectious and Endemic Disease Control at Beijing CDC, explained that the prevalence of influenza typically peaks in December and then declines, with small fluctuations before the epidemic ends in the following spring",
      "However, this year is unique as the intensity of the influenza epidemic and infection rates have remained low for the past three years, resulting in a decreased immune level among the population, said Zhang",

      " The divide has widened significantly over the past few decades according to Fed statistics",
      " Since 1989, the median wealth of white households has tripled, while the wealth of Black, Hispanic and Latino households has barely increased",

      "\" Such are the beginning lines of the poem on the choice of roads by Robert Frost, which was one of my favorites during my college years",
      " I was touched by the firm choice, which would make all the difference later in life",
      " Knowing the importance of the choice of roads, I marvel at the road of Chinese modernization that my nation has taken",
      "Chinese modernization has become a trendy term in the world since the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), highlighting features such as people priority, common prosperity, economic progress and peaceful development",
      " In sharp contrast to Western modernization featuring capital priority, gap between rich and poor, obsession over consumption, and colonialism, Chinese modernization provides a new option for mankind to achieve modernization",
      " In my view, Chinese modernization, the road my nation has taken, has already brought much and will bring more in-depth impact to China and the world at large",
      "This is a road of faith",
      " It has its origin in the long years of struggle of the Chinese people led by the CPC to put an end to their miseries and found the People's Republic of China",
      " It is based on the guidance of Marxism combined with the specific conditions of China and the hard work of the Chinese people, in the new era since the 18th National Congress of the CPC",
      " The 1",
      "4 billion Chinese people, including 96 million Party members, are convinced that this road will prevail, because we have seen ups and downs, sufferings and success, and pains and gains",
      " This faith ushers in the bright future of this road",
      "This is a road to fulfill herculean tasks, most notably the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the unprecedented mission of a much better life for 1",
      "4 billion people",
      " The huge population does mean a great deal",
      " A small problem multiplied by 1",
      "4 billion will be a huge one, while a top mark divided by this number will be tiny",
      " However, the great leadership of the CPC and the solidarity of the brave Chinese People have been proven to pave the way for achieving the tasks",
      " China's GDP rose to 114 trillion yuan in 2021, accounting for 18",
      "5 percent of the global total, up from 54 trillion yuan in 2012",
      " China won the battle against poverty, lifting nearly 100 million people out of extreme poverty, marking a D-Day in human history against poverty",
      " Ten years ago, I took a delegation from a Western country to some poor areas in China",
      " The delegation was amazed by the efforts to tackle poverty and the large-scale construction under way",
      " I really wish that I could have a chance today to show them the thoroughfares built in the mountains and the streamlined workplaces in the modernized factories so that they could see for themselves the anti-poverty progress and the changes in the daily lives of the Chinese people",
      "This is a road for common prosperity",
      " Economic progress marks both Western and Chinese modernization, but who enjoys the economic progress makes the difference",
      " I admired the advancement and wealth of developed countries, but also sighed at the sharp conflicts between the rich and the poor there",
      " That made me better understand only a government of the people and for the people shall be supported by the people",
      " There has been a rise in China's GDP per capita from $6,300 in 2012 to $12,551 in 2021, as well as a great leap forward in terms of people's livelihoods",
      " My family is right on this wagon of progress",
      " When I was a kid, my parents took the country road to move from their village to a town",
      " When I grew up, I took the train to go to college in Beijing, which is 1,000 kilometers away from my hometown",
      " When I worked as a diplomat, I went abroad by plane",
      " Every time I went back to my hometown, I saw the face-lift of the town and the better life of my beloved ones",

      " Ten years ago, with my delicate nose, I suffered from the smog in Beijing",
      " Today, blue sky and white clouds have become the new normal in Beijing",
      " This has been named \"Beijing Miracle\" by the UNEP",
      " Underlying the \"miracle\" is a combination of targeted scientific research, industrial restructuring and regional coordination across different governmental bodies and all sectors of society",
      " The \"miracle\" is just one of many examples showcasing China's response to climate change, which has fulfilled China's commitment to the global battle against climate change and will offer a bright future of green development",
      "This is a road of peaceful development",
      " Peace is the best and dearest public good in the world",
      " Seven years ago, little Aylan lost his life in the cold Aegean Sea while trying to escape the conflicts and wars in Syria",
      " He should have been 10 years old now",
      " The Western Wall in Jerusalem knows how precious it is to pass a day without blood being shed",
      " Nothing is worth more than peace",
      " While the West took the road of violence and robbery to achieve modernization and left a great deal of wounds and scars in the developing world, China has taken a peaceful path toward modernization by seeking its own development and helping other countries develop",
      " The Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative are a recipe for peace from China",
      " With further progress in its modernization, China will do more for human prosperity and world peace",
      "This is a road winning more and more recognition",
      " As there is more than one way to achieve modernization, every country has the right to choose its path according to its own unique past and present conditions, drawing upon experiences of other countries",
      " China stands ready to share its experiences with other nations without strings attached",
      " After the 20th National Congress of the CPC, leaders, officials, experts and journalists from many countries, including Western ones, expressed their appreciation and recognition of Chinese modernization",
      " Speeches by President Xi Jinping when addressing the 17th G20 summit and the 29th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting won wide applause from the audiences",
      " Some people claim that China will export its own development model",
      " The claim is clearly covered by a grey filter and is little more than disinformation",
      " If China did want to export its own model, the Western style would be more direct and effective",
      " Those with a narrow mind and even ill intentions should open up, accept the truth, and stop telling lies and rumors about the Chinese way of modernization",
      " Otherwise, they will only find themselves on the ever-losing side",

      "Faced with the trespass, the PLA dealt with the situation with professional, standard and powerful measures and stabilized the situation, said Senior Colonel Long Shaohua, spokesperson of the PLA Western Theater Command, in a statement released on its official WeChat on Tuesday",
      "The two sides have now disengaged from contact, Long said, urging India to strictly control and restrain the frontline troops and work with China to maintain peace and tranquility along the border",
      "Indian media outlets earlier claimed that there had been a clash between the two sides on the LAC on Friday, which allegedly led to soldiers suffering minor injuries of both sides",
      "Chinese Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Tuesday's press briefing that the current situation is \"generally stable\" and asked India to abide by the spirit of relevant agreements signed by the two sides",
      "Wang stressed that both sides have been maintaining open communication on border-related issues through diplomatic and military channels",
      "\"We hope that India will meet China halfway, implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, strictly abide by the spirit of the relevant agreements signed by the two sides, and jointly maintain peace and tranquility in the border region,\" Wang said",

      "The two countries held the 16th round of the China-India Corps Commander Level Meeting in July, and reached a four-point consensus on the resolution of border issues between China and India",
      "After the conflict in the western section of the China-India border in 2020, both sides stepped up their military configurations as well as infrastructure in the eastern section, Lin Minwang, a professor at the Institute of International Studies of Fudan University, told the Global Times on Tuesday",
      " \"In a way, it was not surprising that both sides would clash in the eastern section of the border",
      "\"However, both sides have continued to negotiate at various levels over the past several years",
      " This shows that both sides want to maintain stability in their relations and that the border situation is stable, Lin said",
      "What is worth noting is that historically, conflicts on the India-China border rarely occur in winter, Lin said",
      " The expert believed that it is possible that India has chosen this timing to start a conflict in an attempt to release a certain message",
      "For India, the expert said, at the strategic level, it needs to signal to the outside world that China-India relations are tense, which is related to maintaining its position in front of the US, and that India also wants to sustain its strategy of balanced diplomacy",

      "For now, after 16 rounds of high-level talks, the two sides have made obvious positive progress through peaceful consultations and commitment to jointly resolve the long-lasted border standoff, he said",

      " Illustration:Liu Rui/GTThe last five years of China-Australia business relations have not been easy",
      " The reason has been the increasingly aggressive \"anti-China\" line from Canberra, although this line simply did not make sense to the Australian business community",
      " As Peter Arkell, former chair of the Shanghai-based Australia-China Chamber of Commerce (Austcham), observed in 2021, Australian companies in China have for 50 years \"invested money and sweat in the bilateral relationship that has delivered in spades for the Australian economy for decades",
      "\"The ideological turn in Canberra was like putting on \"short-sighted\" lenses that were detrimental to Australia's best interests",
      " By and large, businesses are not interested in ideology and the direction of the political wind in Canberra - unless it interferes with their primary concern: economic engagement and business relations",
      "That \"dark cloud\" now seems to be passing",
      " As I write, the tone in the Australian business community is increasingly upbeat",
      " In the wake of bilateral meetings by the two countries' leaders, as well as meetings between the respective foreign and trade ministers, a steady stream of business leaders have begun making their way to China to re-start stalled projects and develop new ones",
      "A good way to gauge this change of tone is to consider the Australia-China Business Council (ACBC), which is the \"premier bilateral business organisation in Australia dedicated to the Australia-China economic relationship",
      "\" ACBC has more than 700 member organizations, more than 20,000 professional members focused on China, and has branches in every Australian state and territory",
      " Its regular reports keep making the case for deepening and extending ties with China",
      " Most recently, they have been promoting their \"green channel\" initiative, hosting well attended events that seek to develop Australia-China collaboration in green energy, electric vehicles, green partnerships for industrial parks, and joint action on climate change",
      " The news is full of China being \"back in business\" and of business and university leaders \"flocking to China",
      "\" The bottom line for ACBC is \"collaboration is the key",
      "\" In their eyes, China has been for many years Australia's number-one trading partner and the two economies are highly complementary",
      "Why has a pragmatic and more balanced approach returned to Australia-China business relations? One reason has to be China's successful transition from the pandemic in the last few months, but another reason is a change of government in Australia",
      " In May 2022, a Labor government at long last took office in Canberra",
      " There are many constraints and pressures - internal and external - on any government in Australia, and they usually have relatively little room to move",
      " However, I would like to emphasize two points",
      "First, the Labor Party in Australia has always preferred a more independent foreign policy",
      " In 1971, the Labor leader Gough Whitlam met premier Zhou Enlai, and when Labor formed government in the following year, one of Whitlam's first moves was to recognize the PRC",
      " Australia's first ambassador to China, Stephen Fitzgerald, has more recently suggested that the Xi-Albanese meeting in Indonesia's Bali late in 2022 is a comparable moment",
      "Over the years since, many in the Labor Party have found it galling that a foreign country - especially the UK and more recently the US - should set the agenda for Australia's foreign policy",
      " They prefer an approach that is genuinely in Australia's best interests",
      " Many former leaders and senior government ministers have been vocal about the need for independent and pragmatic relations with Australia's primary trading partner, China, and with all of Australia's neighbours",
      " The experience of such people has considerable influence within the Labor Party, so we can say it is in the Labor Party's \"genes\" to be more independent and pragmatic in terms of international relations",
      "Second, from time to time the Australian business community has favored the approach of a Labor government",
      " From an Australian perspective, this is a somewhat strange condition, since the Labor Party is not seen as the \"natural\" friend of business",
      " However, in the last few months it has become clear that the relatively new Labor government's more pragmatic and independent approach suits the business community",
      " Simply put, this is good for business",
      "At a more philosophical level, I suggest we understand these recent developments as follows: business, industry, and trade form what may be called the economic base",
      " At this level, a win-win approach to China-Australia engagement is relatively easy, and indeed preferred by the Australian business community",
      " Business is business, and political \"winds\" should not get in the way",
      "However, when we move to matters of culture, philosophy, politics, and so on - what may be called the superstructure - the situation becomes more complicated",
      " At this level, understanding and appreciating each other's cultures takes much patience and time",
      " Of course, the situation is always complex and there are many \"cross-winds\" that can derail the process",
      " But I for one hope that the return to a win-win approach at the economic base will lead over time to a renewed desire for greater cultural and philosophical understanding",

      " But it did not seem to have too much with collective security in the conventional meaning of the notion: In recent years, the West exploits the event to express its determination to defend its hegemony over world affairs",
      " This time, representatives of the US and other Western countries have mainly spoken about their resolve to beat Russia",
      " They made these statements just as unanimously as they hastily evacuated their embassies from Kiev a year ago",
      " And they were as confident as they have been a few months before the US army fled Afghanistan in August 2021",
      "The most vivid was the recently appointed British prime minister who urged countries to stop hoarding weapon stockpiles and give them to Ukraine to allow Kiev to make a decisive assault",
      " Western countries have spent billions of dollars on trying to suppress Russia while their populations are suffering from remarkable inflation",
      " While the US and its allies still have enormous accumulated potential, their lavish practices bring them major troubles internally",

      " The economic sanctions the West imposed on Russia have not been able to produce significant damage",
      " Russia is rapidly changing the direction of its trade relations, including the export of energy resources, of which it has plenty",
      " Infrastructure is developing domestically, and the government is improving the incomes of the population, which is the most important task",
      " Russian citizens are gradually learning how to withstand Western assaults and maintain a customary way of living",
      " IMF forecasts anticipate some growth for the Russian economy as early as 2023, although national estimates are more moderate",
      "The main reasons for Russia's resilience to Western pressure are the long preparation of its economy for this battle and the openness of the global market",
      " The fact that the West can no longer control the whole world defines the context in which the new international order is taking shape",
      " It has come as a surprise to the US and its allies that they cannot prohibit most of the world's countries from trading where it is profitable for them to do so",
      " The pressure on China does not create serious problems for the Chinese economy, but further strengthens Beijing's resolve in matters of principle",
      "What has happened is the destruction of the principle that underpinned Western hegemony - only the US defined the limits of other states' independence",
      " This means the failure of the rules of the game formulated by the West and the emergence of new ones",
      " The US, Europe and Japan are not ready for this and do not know how to interact with the more democratic world",
      " Much of the fury of the statements we heard during the MSC has to do with that discovery",
      " The US and its allies continue to probe the rest of the world for weak spots and bully countries that are less protected from US' irresponsible excesses than China or Russia",
      "Nevertheless, stubbornly defending its hegemony, the West is increasingly embroiled in what is becoming an \"economic Vietnam war\" for Europe and the US",
      " One year after another the West spends more and more on holding its positions instead of investing into new development goals",
      " While US and EU politicians were trying to impress the public in Munich, the rest of the world was watching with horror and dismay the aftermath of the horrific environmental disaster in Ohio",
      " Hoping to force the rest of the world to comply with US demands and caprices, the West itself is experiencing economic decline and the annihilation of vital infrastructure",
      "It is impossible to move forward with one's head turned back",
      " The US and its allies now have nothing to offer the world but a return to their own hegemony: a position that was many years ago and will never be possible again",
      " The West's main mistake is to underestimate the possibilities of the global economy, universal openness, and technological advances",
      " This seems rather strange, since it was the West that insisted for decades on free markets and openness: They must have thought that it would, for some unknown reason, forever serve only their interests",
      "At present, the US most closely resembles a huge, powerful giant on trembling legs, trying to move forward, but constantly looking back at his \"glorious\" past, in which he only sees idealism",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/Global TimesThe West has long believed that there is only one modernity, and that is Western modernity",
      " The origins of this belief lie in the fact that modernization began in the West with Britain's Industrial Revolution and then spread to Europe and the United States",
      " As late as 1900, the West enjoyed a virtual monopoly of modernization, the exception being Japan, the only non-Western country to industrialize in the 19th century",
      " Japanese modernity was very distinct from Western modernity, and still is",
      " But this did not stop the West believing that modernity was singular",
      " When the developing world began to modernize after 1945, the West saw their modernization as synonymous with Westernization",
      " When China embarked on the reform period after 1978, the West regarded it as the beginning of a process of Westernization",
      "The West viewed the world like an escalator: different countries were at different levels of the escalator according to their stage of development, but all were headed in the same direction, destined to become like the West, up there at the top of the escalator",
      " Ultimately, modernization meant the Westernization of the entire world",
      " We would all become like the West, especially like the US, the world's role model",
      " The problem with this idea, which lies at the heart of Western modernization theory, is that it ignores history and culture",
      " Every society is reduced to being, in essence, the same as Western society",
      " It is patently obvious that societies are profoundly shaped by their distinctive histories and cultures, which in turn shape the nature of their modernization and the character of their modernity",
      " There is not one modernity but many modernities",
      "If modernization overwhelmingly belonged to the West until the middle of the 20th century, since then it has increasingly belonged to the rest of the world, where the great majority of humanity live",
      " China, India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and countless others are emerging onto the global stage and bringing with them their histories, languages, cultures, customs, and traditions, which are very different to those of the West",
      " Western universalism - the idea that all countries should and will be Western - is besieged by a world breaking free from the Western template, seeking to rediscover their own many histories and to forge new and different modernities and identities",
      "A monochromatic world dominated by the West is on the defensive in the face of a world of multiple subjects, each with their own story to tell and journey to make",
      " We may live in difficult and fractured times, but the primary reason for this is that the old West-dominated world is on the defensive and in retreat, and a new world is in the process of being created",
      " The difference between the mood in the West and that in many developing countries, most notably in Asia, is stark: Westerners are pessimistic about the future, Asians are optimistic",
      " The developing world is dreaming about the future, Westerners hanker for the past",
      "The Chinese, Indians, Indonesians, and others believe they are increasingly shaping their own futures and those of the world",
      " Modernization, in this context, must be seen as a dynamic and evolving phenomenon",
      " In the early stages, it involves very heavy borrowing from the West or wherever",
      " This was the case in China after 1978, but over time Chinese modernization has increasingly come to depend on its own efforts, primarily because of its economic progress, but also because of growing US hostility to China's rise",
      " The balance has shifted steadily over time from learning and borrowing from the West to indigenous authorship, epitomised by firms like Tencent, Alibaba, BYD, ByteDance, and Huawei",
      " Without doubt this process will continue and intensify",
      " The capacity of the economy to move up the value-chain is fundamental to modernization",
      " But it would be wrong to see modernization, or modernity, as synonymous with the economy",
      " Certainly the economy lies at the core of the early stage of modernization, but that becomes progressively less true as modernization advances",
      " Modernity is about the economy, technology, science, society, culture, sport, demography, gender relations, and countless other things",
      "China has arrived at a similar stage of development as the US in some areas",
      " As a result, it is faced with an entirely new kind of challenge",
      " What kind of modernity does it wish to construct? In what ways will it differ from American modernity? How will Chinese culture in the cyber era differ from that of the US? What should Chinese cities - and great conurbations like Xiong'an - offer? The US and China are both hugely and unacceptably unequal: what should a more equitable Chinese society look like and how might it be achieved? To what extent might Belt and Road offer a new kind of model for the international order? Ray Dalio, head of the world's largest hedge fund, believes that over the next 5-20 years, we will experience, consequent upon quantum computing and AI, the biggest shifts in power and wealth the world has ever seen",

      " They boast of American power and American virtue, hailing the US as a benevolent hegemon",
      "",
      "",
      " While the US regularly denounces various countries as 'rogue states,' in the eyes of many countries it is becoming the rogue superpower,\" wrote US political scientist Samuel P",
      " Huntington in his 1999 article \"The Lonely Superpower",
      "\"The recent remarks US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made reaffirm the argument in Huntington's article that the US is an out-and-out rogue hegemon",
      " Asked about the billions of dollars provided to Ukraine in a CBS television interview aired Friday, the US politician answered, \"viscerally most Americans don't like to see a big country bullying another [country], and they just feel it's wrong and want to do something about it",
      "\"Blinken claimed that Americans don't like the \"BBC\" - not the British one, but a \"big bullying country",
      "\" But in what position is the US, as the world's biggest bully, to say so?From the Middle East to Southeast Asia, from Latin America to Europe, in which continent has the US not left its footprint of bullying other countries? From invading sovereign countries to provoking \"color revolutions,\" from abusing unilateral sanctions to launching technological containment, which one of these moves is not a bullying means of Washington?To most people, it sounds ridiculous for the US to criticize \"big country bullying,\" which ironically makes it seem as if Blinken is throwing shade at his own country",
      "It is either ignorant or shameless for US political elites to say such words without bashing the US",
      " If it is the former, we suggest that these politicians learn more history, especially US history, to see who the greatest \"role model\" of \"big country bullying\" is",
      " If it's the latter, we must be amazed at these people's exceptional ability to play dumb without feeling ashamed",
      "At the end of the day, US' bullying practices are inseparable from its hegemonic position: Hegemony is why Washington can be so brazenly and overbearingly in the world, and bullying aims at maintaining US global dominance",
      " What a hegemon wants is the power to arbitrarily interfere in other nations' sovereignty and internal affairs and push for extreme suppression against any country that may threaten it",
      "Bullying has been in the blood of the US since the country's founding",
      " History has manifested that US' bullying targets not only its rivals and opponents, but also its allies and partners that appeared to be \"disobedient",
      "\" It turns out that the US does not believe in any other country, but only in its own strength",
      "In Washington's view, all land under heaven is its territory, so it has to act as a global sheriff",
      " However, while playing power politics as a global hegemon, the US pretends to be a vigilante against the \"bullying behaviors\" of other major powers",
      " Such hypocrisy is a big slap in Washington's face",
      "Of course, even knowing their country's bullying history, US politicians like Blinken will never admit that the US is a big bully",
      " They have to make all efforts to justify Washington's behaviors, maintain its \"righteous\" image, and prove to the world that US hegemony is needed",
      " This is their job and part of the US national strategy",
      "Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the US to maintain its global hegemony with its diluted strengths",
      " The country now has to sugarcoat its hegemony as a Western hegemony with the US at its core and use values to rope in allies in the West",
      " On multilateral occasions, it practices a fake multilateralism under the banner of upholding the \"rules-based international order,\" the essence of which is still to safeguard US interests",
      "\"Most of the world, as [former president of South Africa] Mandela said, does not want the US to be its policeman,\" said Huntington in \"The Lonely Superpower",
      "\" This still applies to today's world, not to mention that the US has now completely degenerated into a rogue hegemon",
      " Time and again, Washington and US politicians have made themselves untrustworthy to the majority of the world by their selfishness",
      "As a result, US' words have become less persuasive, and the country is gradually isolating itself in the world",

      " This is because China's steady and sustainable economic growth and blooming development of various market entities are of great significance to the stability and growth of the global economy",
      "General secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Xi Jinping emphasized on Monday afternoon that the CPC Central Committee always unswervingly consolidates and develops the public sector, and unswervingly encourages, supports and guides the development of the non-public sector when visiting national political advisors from the China National Democratic Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, who are attending the first session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference",
      " The CPC Central Committee always maintains that the non-public sector's status and functions in the country's economic and social development have not changed, the principle and policies to unswervingly encourage, support and guide the development of the sector have not changed, and the principle and policies to provide a sound environment and more opportunities to the sector have not changed, Xi said",

      " The World Bank did not continue to release this ranking in the past two years, but is preparing to launch the Business Enabling Environment report this year",
      " Last week, the American Chamber of Commerce in South China released the 2023 White Paper on the Business Environment in China, which showed that China is still the most favored destination for corporate investment, with more than 90 percent of surveyed companies considering China as one of their most important investment destinations",

      " Foreign direct investment in China is expected to achieve double-digit growth this year",
      "A new development is that although China's business environment is continuously improving and the Chinese government is firmly committed to this, China seems to be facing more doubts, smears, and attacks internationally than before",

      " The US aims to amplify some normal complaints from foreign enterprises in China and distort them into denial and criticism of China's overall business environment",
      " In other words, it wants to discredit China's business environment in the public opinion field and disrupt the minds of market participants",
      " At the same time, Washington is also aggressively restricting and suppressing foreign enterprises in China through executive orders or domestic legislation",
      " According to a report by US media on March 6, the Biden administration is preparing a new program that could prohibit US investment in certain sectors in China",
      " Washington has had no psychological burden in engaging in such anti-market behavior",
      "The construction and shaping of a business environment is a gradual process, and given that China has only been practicing a market economy for around 30 years, it is inevitable that there are still immature and imperfect aspects",
      " However, enterprises always hope the business environment is getting \"better and better",
      "\" When some policies that regulate the market are first introduced, they may cause some discomfort, but after a period of adaptation, they will provide enterprises with greater development space, more support and protection",

      " Through its endeavors, China has paved a unique path of development for its aerospace industry",
      "The China manned spaceflight program, established in 1992, ended in 2022 with the completion of China's space station",
      " The station has now fully entered the operation and application stages, the CMSA said",
      "Some 27 manned spaceflight tasks were carried out over the 30 years, all of which were completed successfully and in a spectacular manner, according to the CMSA",
      "The exhibition will run for three months",

      " Photo: AFPOn Tuesday evening local time, US President Joe Biden delivered his second State of the Union address in his term of office at the US Capitol",
      " It is reported that Biden was still writing and revising his speech with advisers until the last moment, which shows the importance he attached to it",
      " The wording and narrative of the repeatedly revised speech are carefully thought out and sound decent, but the address gives people the impression that it doesn't have much fresh and practical content",
      "The evaluation of this speech in the US shows a polarized partisan difference",
      " Some Republican lawmakers even booed Biden during his speech, which vividly indicates that the political division in the country has not been gapped and the \"unity\" and \"healing\" sought by Biden has not been achieved",
      " From the State of the Union address and the reaction in the US, we see the same politically divided, sensitive, anxious, and unconfident US",
      " Such a US has made the world uneasy and unsettled",
      "In US' political agenda, the State of the Union address is equivalent to the president's annual work report to Congress to seek lawmakers' support on domestic and foreign policies",
      " However, the speech has actually become a kind of work report from the US president to the entire US society or even the whole world, focusing on US domestic affairs and major foreign policies",
      " Thus, the State of the Union address is usually regarded as the US presidents' \"annual speech for self-praise,\" and this time is no exception",
      " The State of the Union addresses since the end of the Cold War have charted a clear trajectory that the US has gradually changed from a highly confident, optimistic, and pro-diversity country to today's sensitive, suspicious, and narrow-minded nation",
      " This is regrettable",
      "At a time when pessimism spreads widely in the US, Biden used many parts of his address to portray the current administration's economic and social achievements over the past year",
      " He tried to convey to lawmakers and voters that \"this country is not in decline,\" but the results didn't meet his expectations",
      " The more Biden emphasizes his country's strength, the more people unconsciously turn their eyes to the vulnerable corners of the US society",
      " A US poll before the speech shows that 62 percent of Americans think Biden has accomplished \"not very much\" or \"little or nothing\" in the past two years, while 65 percent believe their country is \"on the wrong track",
      "\" Biden's public approval rating has fallen to only 41 percent, close to the lowest level of his presidency",
      " Americans' confidence in the country's path has hit a record low",
      "In recent years, the US State of the Union addresses, without exception, all emphasized the extraordinary strength of the country and have paid more and more attention to the issue of \"unity",
      "\" This just reflects what the US lacks the most: the momentum of economic development and the foundation of political unity",
      " Not just Biden",
      " In fact, polls before the State of the Union addresses these years have all shown that US presidents' approval ratings have always been quite low, and \"Americans are dissatisfied",
      "\" The fundamental reason is that the vicious struggle between the two parties has seriously dragged down the country",
      " The US has become increasingly sensitive and radical, only caring about the so-called political correctness and ignoring real national interests",
      "The occupant of the White House is actually aware of this embarrassing situation, but since the last US government, each administration has prescribed extremely wrong medicines and has retreated sharply toward trade protectionism and unilateralism",
      "Biden said in his speech, \"On my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways are going to be made with American products",
      "\" In addition to the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act he mentioned, they are all manifestations of the US' mentality moving from openness to closure",
      " It might find a place in the fierce competition between the two parties, but its damage to the US is long-term",
      " It not only fails to respond to the real needs of the American people, but also makes a superpower that blindly pursues neo-isolationism more dangerous",
      " The international community, including its European allies, has become uneasy about this, and related industries in the US are also under tremendous pressure",
      "In recent years, as China-US relations have become tense, how the US president mentioned China in the State of the Union address has attracted particular attention from the public",
      " Biden talked about \"China\" six times in the 2023 address",
      " Some people in the US criticized him for not being tough enough on China, while others praised him for showing restraint and calmness",
      "In our perspective, \"soft\" or \"tough\" is relative",
      " But Biden's speech reflects that he has accepted the wrong perception of China that is popular in Washington and regards China-US relations as a negative-sum game, where \"you lose more, and I lose less",
      "\" Washington is performing self-harm while trying to hurt Beijing",
      "Although Biden stated that the US seeks \"competition, not conflict\" with China, it is still not comprehensive to use \"competition\" to define China-US relations",
      " China has always insisted that the success of both China and the US is an opportunity rather than a challenge to each other, and the vast globe can fully accommodate the development and common prosperity of China and the US",
      " Frankly speaking, in terms of demeanor and breadth of vision, this speech does not look like a State of the Union addressmade by the president of a major country that considers itself a world leader",

      " China USIn the past few years, the two recent US administrations have comprehensively adjusted their strategies toward China, and the policy of \"engagement\" has been replaced by \"strategic competition",
      "\" In the face of Washington's actions that pursue hegemony and power politics, China has, justifiably, resolutely counteracted and fought back",
      " In the cycle of \"US crackdown and Chinese counterattack,\" bilateral relations have seen a downward spiral",
      "While we attach great importance to Washington's challenge, we should consider thinking beyond the US-China bilateral rivalry and focus on maintaining and enhancing China's overall connectivity with other parts of the world",
      " In this way, we can win the long-term strategic game between China and the US, creating conditions for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation",
      "On the one hand, such a vision requires China to connect with the rest of the world",
      " It has become a national consensus in China that opening-up brings progress, while closing the door would lead to backwardness",
      " From the current stage of China's development to the full realization of the Chinese path to modernization and national rejuvenation, there is a greater need for full connectivity with the rest of the world",
      "On the other hand, the great changes that have not been seen in a century are bringing us the shock of confrontation, and camp politics",
      " The development and rise of China is the most profound change, which has triggered Washington to worry about and attempt to suppress Beijing's development",
      " US policymakers are now determined to exclude China from the interconnected world at all costs",
      "China's national rejuvenation endeavor requires us to maintain close connectivity with the rest of the world, especially developed countries which the US is trying to find ways to hinder",
      " What is particularly important to note is that it is justified and reasonable for Beijing to counter Washington's \"decoupling\" actions, but it may also accelerate the \"decoupling\" from the opposite direction",
      " Thus, how and when to take countermeasures will put our wisdom to the test",
      "The US' current strategy toward China is dangerous",
      " The danger lies in not only Washington's various actions against Beijing, but also the US' attempt to push China out of the global political and economic network",
      "We need to see that, compared to 44 years ago when China-US diplomatic relations were established, one of the biggest changes in China-US relations is that China's national power has increased significantly, China is closely connected to the world, and China's ability to shape its bilateral relations has greatly increased",
      "First, on issues related to China's territorial sovereignty, political security, fundamental system, and other core interests, if the US responds with negativity, China is also pushed to respond negatively",
      " China has no room for compromise and must deter US actions through resolute and strong countermeasures",
      " The experience of the past few years shows that even if Washington promotes decoupling, as long as China responds properly and works in a targeted manner, a complete decoupling from China will be difficult to achieve",
      "Second, facing the US' negative moves, we need to adopt more positive approaches with Europe, Asia-pacific countries, and the vast developing world",
      " The ASEAN countries and US allies in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region are particularly worthy of China's attention",
      " It can be seen that other countries do not want to take sides between China and the US, and even some US allies are not fully in sync with Washington in their strategies toward China",
      "Third, we must recognize the complexity and diversity within the US",
      " At present, conflicts between two sides are more at the bilateral or regional level, but on global issues such as climate change and public health, Washington still needs to cooperate with China, which is not only in the interest of both countries, but also the expectation of the whole world",
      "In face of the fundamental adjustment of the US strategy toward China, China, as a major power, should maintain its strategic focus, move beyond the bilateral level of competition between China and the US and unswervingly focus on promoting connectivity required by China's overall strategy of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, especially with developed countries including the US",

      "Experts said the failure won't have much impact on whether Chinese people can buy Paxlovid, and that would depend on the amount Pfizer is able to supply to China",
      "Paxlovid will not be added to the list of medicines covered by China's basic medical insurance plans because the company's quotation was too high, China's Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) announced on Sunday",

      "The staffer said that they hadn't received any notice about when Paxlovid will be excluded from the insurance drug list",
      "The Global Times learned that a major hospital in Beijing's Daxing district usually gets Paxlovid from the NHSA under the coordination and distribution of the Beijing health commission, while public insurance covers most of the drug's cost",

      " The origins-tracing is a complex matter of science",
      " This study should be and can only be conducted jointly by scientists around the world",
      "\"A laboratory origin of the pandemic was considered to be 'extremely unlikely' is a science-based, authoritative conclusion reached by the experts of the WHO-China joint mission after field trips to the lab in Wuhan and in-depth communication with researchers",
      " It was accurately recorded in the mission's report and has received extensive recognition from the international community and the science community,\" Mao said",
      "China strongly opposes political manipulation of the origins-tracing issue in any form",
      " Putting the intelligence community in charge for a matter of science is a clear sign that the issue has been politicized, Mao said",
      "Given the US intelligence community's track record of making up stories, there is little, if any, credibility in their conclusions",
      " The US will not succeed in discrediting China by rehashing the \"lab leak\" theory, but will only hurt the US' own reputation, Mao noted",
      "The spokesperson urged the US to respect science and facts, stop politicizing this issue, stop its intelligence-led, politics-driven origins-tracing, and stop undermining international solidarity against the pandemic and global cooperation on science-based origins-tracing",
      "At present, more and more clues from the international science community are pointing the origins of virus to sources around the world",
      " Many have raised questions and concerns about US bio-military bases at Fort Detrick and around the world, according to Mao",
      "The US should work with the WHO to invite experts from the world to the US for origins-tracing study as soon as possible, and share the research result with the international community in a timely, open and transparent manner, Mao said",

      " US Ukraine crisis Illustration: Liu Rui/GTOn the one-year anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, China issued a position paper titled \"China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis,\" systematically elaborating on China's stance in 12 points",
      " As a responsible major country, although China is not a party to the Ukraine crisis, it is always willing to play a constructive role in promoting a resolution to it",
      " What this document shows is China's sincerity and goodwill in actively promoting peace talks",
      "At present, the Russia-Ukraine conflict is still in a stalemate, and it is difficult to see the possibility of it easing in the short term",
      " However, no one can afford a long-term war of attrition, and its spillover effects have aroused widespread vigilance in the international community",
      " The impact of this crisis on the vast number of developing countries that urgently need to achieve their development goals is especially direct and strong",
      " It is precisely because of this that these countries are unwilling to be forced to choose sides in the conflict, but eagerly hope that all parties can find a rational and peaceful solution",
      " In this context, the significance and value of the document issued by China on Friday is even more prominent",
      "Since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, China has always stuck to doing what is right and followed the course of objectivity and justice",
      " President Xi Jinping has put forward four principles, called for joint efforts in four areas, and shared three observations on Ukraine, playing a responsible and constructive role in easing the situation and resolving the crisis and outlining China's fundamental approach to the issue",
      " This document covers 12 areas: respecting the sovereignty of all countries, abandoning the Cold War mentality, ceasing hostilities, resuming peace talks, resolving the humanitarian crisis, protecting civilians and prisoners of war, keeping nuclear power plants safe, reducing strategic risks, facilitating grain exports, stopping unilateral sanctions, keeping industrial and supply chains stable, and promoting post-conflict reconstruction",
      " It not only reiterated China's consistent proposition, but also absorbed the reasonable concerns of all countries, reflecting the greatest common denominator of the international community on the Ukraine issue",
      "China's position on the Ukrainian issue is neutral but not passive, and is a stance that can be accurately described as \"active neutrality",
      "\" China's position paper reflects the demands of both Russia and Ukraine, and also addresses broader international issues such as nuclear war, food security, and global strategic stability",
      " The paper is highly condensed and specific, with great relevance to the current situation",
      " It fully recognizes the complexity and difficulty of the issue, and shows China's responsible attitude of not standing idly by, not fueling the fire, and opposing taking advantage of the situation",
      "There is an old Chinese saying: Sickness comes like a landslide, sickness goes like a thread being drawn",
      " It is important to emphasize that we should not expect anyone to come up with a magic solution that will immediately solve the Ukraine crisis",
      " No person, country, or international organization can achieve this",
      " As stated in the position paper, complex problems do not have simple solutions",
      " However, no matter how complex the problem is, we should not give up on dialogue and negotiation; no matter how sharp the dispute is, we should persist in seeking a political solution; and no matter how difficult the situation is, we should give peace a chance",
      " The position paper released by China reflects the efforts to resolve disputes through dialogue and negotiation and build a regional security structure to achieve peace",
      " This is not only possible but also feasible",
      "Of course, people also see that some in the US and the West do not seem to want the conflicting parties to return to the negotiating table, but are trying to further muddy the waters and pursue their own interests",
      " Just before the first anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the so-called \"China responsibility\" theory has emerged in various guises",
      " For example, the US and NATO, which were the initiators of the conflict, have repeatedly and groundlessly claimed that China \"may provide weapons to Russia\" in order to pressure China",
      " However, it is clear to everyone which side is constantly delivering heavy weapons to the battlefield, and there are even tragic incidents such as the Nord Stream pipeline being bombed to prevent both sides from returning to the negotiating table",
      "Currently, the US and the West are questioning and attacking China's friendly relations with Russia on the one hand, while on the other, they are asking China to use this relationship to play the role they expect in the Ukraine crisis",
      " This is contradictory",
      " Now that China has released its position paper, they cannot find a point of attack, so they start nitpicking and changing the topic",
      " In the eyes of the US and the West, any solution that does not put pressure on Russia is not a good one",
      " When they exert extreme pressure on Russia, normal contacts between other countries and Russia appear glaringly obvious",
      " In fact, they cannot tolerate a neutral stance",
      " In contrast, Russia and Ukraine, as the parties concerned, have a generally positive attitude toward China's position",
      " This is very thought-provoking",
      "We believe that it is especially necessary for the political elites in the US and the West to carefully study the 12-point position paper by China",
      " Although it is aimed at the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it can also serve as a reference for the turbulence and conflicts that occur elsewhere in the world, most of which are closely related to the foreign policies of the US and the West",
      " How to prevent humanitarian tragedies from happening at the source and achieve lasting peace and universal security is what the world needs to consider most on the one-year anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " The position and views proposed by China will also endure over time and exhibit their shining historical value over the course of history",

      "gov",
      "cnSenior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi has been in a whirlwind of bilateral meetings with foreign leaders and diplomats on the sidelines of the ongoing Munich Security Conference (MSC) that was scheduled from Friday to Sunday",
      "Analysts noted that China's vision for global security and development is not only delivered through Wang's planned speech at the MSC, a key part of the agenda for the Wang's overall trip, but also conveyed in bilateral interactions and weaved into discussion on further cooperation across a broad range of topics",
      "After having visited France and Italy, Wang, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, arrived in Germany on Friday",
      " He had met with leaders and diplomats including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Gernman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Mongolian Foreign Minister Batmunkh Battsetseg",
      " He will continue his visit to Hungary and Russia after attending the MSC",
      "When meeting Scholz, Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said China is ready to fully restart exchanges with Germany and Europe in various fields, expand mutually beneficial cooperation and enhance mutual understanding, Xinhua News Agency reported",
      "Both China and Germany should support multilateralism and free trade, reject practices of \"decoupling\" and severing supply chains, and safeguard the stability of global production and supply chains, Wang said",
      "Although China and Germany have different social systems and cultural backgrounds, safeguarding world peace and promoting global development serves the common interests of the two countries and is also the two's common responsibility, the Chinese diplomat told Baerbock",
      "Zhao Junjie, a research fellow from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of European Studies, told the Global Times on Saturday that bilateral face-to-face communication is important in dispelling mistrust and enhancing mutual understanding when China and Europe face bumps in their relations",
      "Stable and sound China-Germany relations are crucial to China and Europe rebooting ties considering Germany's status as a major regional country, being member of both the EU and NATO, Zhao said",
      "L\u00fc Xiang, research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that Wang's trip could play a constructive role in mediating peace between Russia and the NATO, and help the world find common ground in post-COVID recovery",
      "With the Russia-Ukraine conflict dominating the MSC agenda, China's role is not only to deliver its broad security vision, but also to show the world that despite of differences and disagreements with some countries, China, as a responsible major power, can have dialogue and cooperate in a mutually beneficial way rather than getting indulged in confrontational mentality, analysts said",
      "The MSC, traditionally focusing more on transatlantic partnership, has invited delegations from emerging economies this year as the world is facing grave conflicts and uncertainties",
      "During his meeting with Bilawal, Wang stressed China and Pakistan's strategic consensus on building an even closer community of shared future in the new era, Xinhua reported",
      "The two sides also exchanged views on strengthening mutual support under the current international situation",
      "Commenting on the recent \"China-US balloon row,\" Wang pointed out that the unintended entry of a Chinese civilian unmanned airship into US airspace was due to force majeure, and this isolated, unexpected incident should have been handled calmly, rationally and professionally",
      "However, the US ignored the basic facts, abused force, overreacted and hyped the situation, he said, adding that this almost hysterical practice showed that the US' prejudice and ignorance of China has reached an absurd level",
      "China demands that the US show sincerity in solving the problem and stop doing such absurd things out of domestic political needs, Wang said",
      "When he met with Battsetseg, the senior diplomat expressed the willingness to enhance cooperation on areas including trade, mining, infrastructure, anti-desertification and cultural exchanges",
      "With the impact of the Ukraine crisis casting a shadow over the global stability and economic recovery, China's stance is consistent - promoting peace talks, urging de-escalation, and calling for mutual understanding and cooperation to replace a policy of decoupling and bloc confrontation, analysts said",

      "Meanwhile, with the adjustment and optimization of the country's epidemic prevention and control measures, this year's \"two sessions,\" one of the most important annual political events, is expected to return to normal, experts said",
      "There are 2,172 members from 34 sectors, with 85 from the newly established environment and resources sector, media reported on Wednesday",
      "The first session of the 14th National Committee of the CPPCC will start on March 4 and the 14th National People's Congress will kick off its first session on March 5, the country's top legislature announced on December 30",
      "In line with the guidelines of enhancing and improving the work of the CPPCC issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the 13th National Committee of the CPPCC has been pushing forward the establishment of the environment and resources sector",
      "In recent years, some regional committees of the CPPCC began adding this new sector and regional committees across the 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have added the new sector, called the environment and resources or resources and the environment",
      "\"No matter whether it's about the comprehensive economic and social development or Chinese modernization, environmental and resource protection, as an important part of the Five-Pronged Overall Approach since the 18th National Congress, conveys great significance,\" Zhu Lijia, a professor of public management at the Chinese Academy of Governance, told the Global Times on Wednesday",
      "To pursue Chinese modernization, environmental protection and construction is fundamental, and setting up this new sector could help policy makers and advisors play bigger roles in formulating environment-related policies and measures, Zhu said",
      "Li Zhenhan, a member of the regional committee of the CPPCC in East China's Shandong Province, was quoted as saying in media reports on Wednesday that setting up this new sector could help allocate resources and bring members with various backgrounds in the environment, resources and energy who used to work in different sectors together",
      "Environmental protection will continue being a major focus of the work of the CPC in the future",
      " In a report delivered by General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Xi Jinping to the 20th National Congress of the CPC in October 2022, Xi pointed out that we will advance the Beautiful China Initiative and take a holistic and systematic approach to the conservation and improvement of mountains, waters, forests, farmlands, grasslands and deserts",
      "\"We will carry out coordinated industrial restructuring, pollution control, ecological conservation and climate response, and promote concerted efforts to cut carbon emissions, reduce pollution, expand green development and pursue economic growth, he said",
      " We will prioritize environmental protection, conserve resources and use them efficiently, and pursue green and low-carbon development,\" Xi said",
      "This year's two sessions will also be the first annual gatherings for the country's two main political bodies to set priorities and plans involving the economy, military, trade, diplomacy and the environment for the next year since the country downgraded its COVID-19 management",
      "Some experts believed that as the country's social and economic activities have been brought gradually back to normal following the adjustment and optimization of the epidemic prevention and control measures, the country's most important annual political activities are also expected to go to back to normal",
      "Some experts considered that the economic recovery and China's population decline would be major focuses of this year's two sessions, especially when many observers and analysts remain bullish on China's economic prospects",
      " Also, the Chinese mainland's population declined for the first time in 61 years, which attracted the world's attention",
      "Among 2,172 members, there are 124 from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and 29 from the Macao SAR",

      "\"This year's two sessions will mainly focus on the economic recovery, including how to accelerate the production resumption and push forward high-quality growth,\" Zhu said",

      "When fishing boats encounter dangerous waves or face other accidents, the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency is able to reach the site and carry out rescue missions with the fastest speed thanks to its induction of vessels made by China and its application of Chinese methods, Awan said",
      "Having served on the PMSS Kashimir for two years, Awan said the vessel built in Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong Province was commissioned in 2018",
      " Compared with another type of vessel built by another country Awan had served on, the Chinese vessel excels because the Chinese shipbuilder designed it based on the operational methods of the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency",

      " China-EU Photo: VCGWang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, is currently on a visit in Europe",
      " He has met with French President Emmanuel Macron, French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Antonio Tajani, Italian President Sergio Mattarella, and other European leaders",
      " Next, he will also visit Hungary and Russia and attend the 59th Munich Security Conference in Germany",
      " Wang's visit gives a positive signal of a \"reboot\" and has received positive responses",
      " Macron said that the time for reconnection with China has come, while Colonna said that it is necessary to make up for the time lost due to the pandemic",
      "Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, China and Europe have lost many opportunities for direct communication and exchange over the past three years",
      " During that period, the international situation has undergone significant changes, most notably, the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " Regrettably, the lack of communication has led to misunderstandings and even misjudgments of China by some Europeans, which has to some extent impeded China-Europe cooperation",
      " However, there are no fundamental contradictions between China and Europe, and apart from their respective core interests, nothing cannot be discussed",
      " On various issues such as global governance, the two sides should bring the power of China-Europe cooperation into full play and make the world a better place",
      "The fact proves that there is broad consensus, common interests and a common stance between China and Europe",
      " Macron has reiterated his commitment to upholding multilateralism, opposing bloc confrontation and avoiding division in the world",
      " This strategic position is representative in Europe and highly accords with China's position",
      "The wish to strengthen cooperation with China, communicate and engage with China is still the mainstream attitude in Europe",
      " We can see this from the warm welcome that Wang received during his visit to Europe",
      "It should be emphasized that the relationship between China and Europe has never been dependent on the China-US relationship, although Washington has always been working in that direction",
      " In the 1960s, when General Charles de Gaulle sent a personal letter to China expressing his hope to establish diplomatic relations, the US was still busy besieging China",
      " Now, the spillover effects of the tense relations between China and the US are inevitably interfering with the relationship between China and Europe, but at the same time, it highlights the importance of the independent development of the China-Europe relationship",
      " As two global powers, the China-Europe relationship has inherent development patterns and dynamics",
      " China has always viewed and handled the China-Europe relationship from a strategic perspective, hoping Europe could meet China halfway",
      "Chinese people understand the difficulties Europe currently faces",
      " The green digital transformation and the Russia-Ukraine conflict are the two major issues troubling the continent",
      " On these two issues, Europe clearly sees that Washington is not helping, but rather sabotaging and sacrificing Europe's security and interests for its own gain",
      "Just before the Chinese delegation's visit, some voices in the US claimed that this visit \"will not be a reconciliation,\" as \"Europe is not in the mood for love",
      "\"This statement is less a judgment from the US media than a reflection of their narrow-minded wishes: what they would like to see the most is China-Europe relations deteriorating, and they are least willing to see China and Europe come closer",
      " As a result, it will be difficult for them to understand and grasp the mainstream of China-Europe relations",
      "Rebooting and strengthening communication and dialogue often signify a good start, as demonstrated by past history",
      " During Wang's visit to Europe, France announced the lifting of entry restrictions for Chinese travelers, and the EU will also end the requirement for negative pre-departure COVID tests this month, which is seen by many as a positive signal",
      " In addition, the ice on the frozen China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment also needs to be broken, as the mutually beneficial agreement, which came about through seven years of difficult negotiations, should not be easily shelved",
      " Regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which is of great concern in Europe, China and Europe share the common goal of a ceasefire and peace talks",
      " Both sides are also willing to make political and diplomatic efforts to explore a political solution that truly benefits all parties",
      "China and Europe need to restart cooperation while moving forward",
      " As Wang said, China and Europe need to make moves as soon as possible",
      " This comes from a sense of urgency and responsibility",
      " China and Europe have been interacting with each other for a long time",
      " We believe that in the great changes unseen in a century, Europe will not make strategic mistakes and push China, which is supposed to be a strategic partner, into becoming its rival",
      " Future China-Europe relations are bound to experience turbulence and uncertainties, but they should steer toward a better future",
      " This is the aspiration and pursuit that China and Europe, as the world's two major powers, major markets, and major civilizations, are supposed to have",

      " A view of the Taipei city, Taiwan island Photo: UnsplashChina urged the US to fulfill its top leader's commitment on not supporting \"Taiwan independence\" separatists and to stop official and military exchanges in any form with the island of Taiwan and to stop meddling with the Taiwan question or creating new factors that put pressure on the cross-Straits situation, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Friday",
      "Wang's remarks came after the Financial Times reported that the Pentagon's top China official, Michael Chase, plans to visit the island of Taiwan in the coming days and said Chase would be the most senior US defense official to visit the island since 2019",
      "China's stance on opposing official exchanges between the US and the island of Taiwan is consistent and clear, said Wang, urging the US to abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqu\u00e9s",
      "The report on Chase's visit to Taiwan came when Republicans on Congress' foreign affairs and armed services committees asked US President Joe Biden to propose as much as $2 billion in military aid for the island when he releases his fiscal 2024 budget request, which is expected next month, the US media reported on Friday",
      "A letter signed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking member Jim Risch and obtained by Defense News asked Biden to increase the State Department's overall Foreign Military Financing budget in order to accommodate additional grants for the island to purchase US defense equipment",
      "Analysts warned that as China-US relations are in a state of sensitivity due to the US' overreaction to the deviated Chinese airship, any further provocation, especially concerning China's core interests like the Taiwan question, could further endanger bilateral relations",
      "Both Republicans and Democrats have tried to use the Taiwan question to contain China",
      " The GOP-controlled House is now pushing further military aid to the island of Taiwan with its \"power of the purse,\" Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times",
      "The Republicans' letter aims to push Biden to be more aggressive on the Taiwan question and Biden's prudence on the question may incur strong criticism from the GOP",
      " This may lead to more irrational handling of the Taiwan question and less room for change, Li said",
      "Aside from imposing pressure on Biden, the Republicans also want the letter to incite an atmosphere of support for the island of Taiwan and to use public opinion against the Democrats, said Li",
      "The Republicans are exerting efforts in taking over the steering wheel from the White House and the provocation will affect China-US relations, analysts said",
      "The Taiwan question is an important issue within China-US relations",
      " However, the US' current policy is split",
      " The White House has its strategy while Congress seems to adopt another, resulting in mixed signals from the US, said Li",

      " Slandering Xinjiang -- the new normal of the \"empire of lies\" Illustration: Vitaly PodvitskiAmnesty International reportedly made a submission to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in January and some of it surprised me",
      " The report repeated some of the threadbare claims of so-called China's human rights abuse against Muslim ethnic population in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region",
      "I live in China, I've traveled extensively, including many kilometers across Xinjiang",
      " First in 2014 when I cycled from Macao to the Kazakhstan border, and again in 2019, I flew to Urumqi and cycled home to Guangdong",
      " In doing so, I passed through several Xinjiang cities, many towns and countless villages, met with Uygurs, ate in their restaurants and watched as they went to their mosques",
      "I saw enhanced security, there are a lot of police officers, but I saw no oppression and certainly no abuses or crimes against humanity",
      " It's easy to say: just because I didn't see it doesn't mean it isn't happening and I accept that, but what I did encounter was friendly, welcoming people who weren't afraid to invite us into their homes, who gave us gifts of fruit or bottled water and wouldn't take payment for their kindness",
      "When you see people like this, you realize that they aren't oppressed, they live normal, but simple lives",
      " On the occasions I asked about the enhanced security, the only answer I received was, we feel safer than before; I can accept that people in the cities may have been programmed to say this but surely, the shopkeeper in the village, the farmer in the fields and the waiter in the restaurant can't all keep to the same script without at least one of them giving some indication that they aren't telling the truth",
      "I should add here that I've been trained in interview techniques, I've learnt how to tell when someone is lying and, for sure, some people can tell a lie and get past a trained, even a skilled observer, but definitely not all of them",
      "Call me a denialist, I'm certain many will, but the fact is, inside Xinjiang, there is no evidence and no visible indicators that any form of oppression is going on, nor that Uygur people are being singled out for harsh treatment, or that Muslims are in any way oppressed",
      " It just isn't visible anywhere in Xinjiang, other Muslim populated regions I've cycled through such as Gansu, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, or anywhere else in China for that matter",
      "Over the last three years, I've experienced lockdown, quarantine and a range of restrictions due to COVID-19",
      " Every single person I spoken to in China, who is Chinese, supported these restrictions but had some complaints about personal inconveniences",
      " Even the Edelman Trust Barometer which stood at 91 for China last year and fell to 89 this year is an indicator that Chinese people believe the restrictions were appropriate",
      " The fact that, at the time of writing, globally, almost 7 million people have died of COVID, tells Chinese people that their government were right to prevent that happening in China",
      "So, I'm surprised that this Amnesty report dedicated more of its pages to these two things",
      " The report doesn't make allegations: it makes statements, without any admissible evidence, that China is carrying out crimes against humanity using \"former detainees, satellite imagery and data\" as sources",
      "It says many groups have been oppressed or imprisoned for practicing religion",
      " It also says that \"recent regulations\" have further tightened the government's grip on religious practices and ethnic minority groups and then goes on to cite only the regulations related to de-extremism in Xinjiang adopted six years ago, on March 29, 2017 and translated by Yale University's China Law Translate",
      " Take a few moments to read the English version of these and it's hard to find anything in these laws to disagree with, or which aren't imposed in other countries where religious extremism has been a problem",
      "The report has 42 footnotes and 28 of them, in circular references, link the reader to previous Amnesty International reports",
      " Of the others, several are Chinese media cited to demonstrate human rights abuses exist, but which confirm action is being taken such as this Global Times report where 17 people were punished by China for human trafficking",
      " Proving that China is indeed working hard to stamp out these crimes",
      " But then, if the perpetrators were sentenced to death for such heinous crimes, there would be an outcry from Amnesty for that",
      "There are many aspects to Amnesty's 16 page report but all of them share the same issues, they provide no methodology, no evidence from anyone inside of Xinjiang or even China, other than unsubstantiated Weibo videos in support, and the satellite imagery referred to is not referenced at all",
      " Could this be because it is the already debunked US funded, Australian think tank, ASPI report?As a submission to a UN Committee, it isn't one to be taken seriously",
      " It rehashes old reports, makes unsubstantiated allegations, uses already discredited examples and provides no balance",
      " There is no evidence that people within China were consulted nor that any effort was made to verify the truth of allegations given to Amnesty by people outside of China, all of whom appear to have left China with a government issued passport by legitimate means",
      "The author is a British Australian freelance writer who has studied cross cultural change management in China and has lived in the country, traveling extensively for 18 years",

      " India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi (on screen) addresses the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting (FMM) in New Delhi on March 2, 2023",
      "Photo: VCGAt a time when the Ukraine crisis overshadows the world's multilateral cooperation platforms, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang called on G20 member countries on Thursday to uphold the UN-centered international system and reject power politics and bloc confrontation, underscoring China's role in safeguarding multilateralism",
      "The G20 is the premier forum for international economic cooperation",
      " Faced with a volatile international situation and rising global challenges, the G20 must rise to the occasion, enhance cooperation, and contribute its share to global development and prosperity, Qin said at the G20 (FMM) Session I on Thursday",
      "This year's G20 FMM came amid escalating tensions over the Ukraine crisis, especially as the US-led West tries every way to hijack the multilateral mechanism to \"condemn Russia\" and force its geopolitical agenda onto a platform originally designed to tackle economic challenges",
      " Some media suggested that this antagonism has left \"India in the unenviable position of trying to reconcile clearly irreconcilable differences,\" saying the \"East-West showdown over Ukraine looms at the G20 meeting",
      "\"Against the backdrop of the current global situation, strengthening multilateralism is more important than ever before",
      " The G20 should play a key and special role, and all parties should show their political will, seek the greatest consensus, and take concrete actions to promote inclusive cooperation to make the economy more resilient and address global challenges, Qin said",
      "It's also Qin's first visit to India since he became China's new foreign minister in December 2022",
      " Some observers believed that Qin's India trip could open up new possibilities for the bilateral relationship, which has faced numerous challenges over the past few years due to border disputes",
      " Some media called it a \"fence-mending\" visit",
      "However, some Chinese experts hold a more cautious view on the interaction between the Chinese and Indian foreign ministers, saying that such high-level dialogue could be seen as a positive signal in helping restore mutual trust, but it's unlikely that bilateral relations will significantly improve from just one visit",
      "Multilateralism in crisisIn a video address, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the meeting, attended by 40 delegations that included top diplomats such as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, that \"the last few years of financial crises, climate change, pandemic, terrorism and war have clearly shown that global governance has failed in both its mandates",
      "\"Warning that \"multilateralism\" is in a state of \"crisis,\" Modi also said that \"we should not allow issues that we cannot resolve together to come in the way of those we can",
      "\"India - which holds the G20 presidency this year - has come under growing pressure to strike a balancing act",
      " \"Modi has tried to pressure those attendees, as global governance has been in a very dangerous position, considering the turbulent world and growing challenges that we face today,\" Zhu Jiejin, a professor of global governance studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "In response to those challenges, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has put forward a four-point proposal at the meeting, including upholding the UN-centered international system and international order, handling global affairs through discussion and rejecting power politics and bloc confrontation, rejecting unilateralism, protectionism and attempts to decouple, and making global development more inclusive, resilient and beneficial for all",
      "The original intention of creating G20, a multilateral platform, was to coordinate the macroeconomic policies and development goals of different countries, allowing it to serve as a platform for cooperation and exchanges",
      " However, this platform has been taken over by political topics like the Russia-Ukraine crisis, which will undoubtedly have a negative impact on global cooperation and also increasingly prevent the G20 itself from playing a constructive role, some experts warned",
      "\"It is important for G20 to stay focused on its original mandate of ensuring macroeconomic stability and focusing on the impending debt crisis, especially for developing countries",
      " As for the Ukraine crisis, in the face of both Russia and the US remaining entrenched in escalating rather than mitigating or terminating violence, the onus lies now with middle powers,\" Swaran Singh, professor of international relations at Jawaharlal Nehru University (New Delhi) and currently visiting professor at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver), told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "Singh also noted that a worse-case scenario of no consensus statement from the FMM will only further damage the G20 group's potential to remain the world's most powerful and most representative forum for global governance, which will also further undermine multilateralism, bringing dangerous global implications",
      "The G20 FMM on Thursday was unable to come out with a joint communiqu\u00e9 due to sharp differences over the Ukraine conflict, according to media reports",
      "Bilateral ties in focusAhead of the meeting, Blinken said he has \"no plans\" to meet with the Russian and Chinese foreign ministers, sending out a negative signal for this major gathering, especially after the US has been ramping up efforts to contain Russia and provoke China at the same time by accusing China of considering providing lethal support, including weapons and ammunition to aid Moscow",
      " The US official also said on Thursday that \"this meeting has again been marred\" by the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      "\"Unfortunately, the US, along with some European countries, has never stopped fueling the fire and coercing more countries into the conflict, even by making use of a platform like G20, which is not only harmful but also immoral,\" L\u00fc Xiang, research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "Under the guise of being anti-war, the US, along with some countries, is actually staging anti-Russia moves",
      " Under such circumstances, it's hard to imagine that the G20 FMM would reach any consensus and bring any concrete outcome, he said",
      "On the sidelines of the G20 FMM, Qin met foreign counterparts including Lavrov, Australia's Penny Wong and Germany's Annalena Baerbock",
      " The meeting between Qin and India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also attracted a great deal of attention in the Indian media",
      "While some observers hold a positive attitude toward a possible improvement in China-India relations, which has seen a major downward spiral in the past few years, some Chinese experts believed that this single interaction will not be able to bring relations back to how they used to be",
      "\"The high-level dialogue will surely help rebuild mutual trust, paving the way for resuming the bilateral ties step by step,\" Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times",
      " \"But we can't count on one interaction to solve all problems,\" he said",

      "The incident occurred after the Hong Kong team defeated Iran 11-1 in Group B of the competition with the wrong song being played for around 10 seconds",
      " Some members from the Hong Kong team made a \"T-gesture sign\" to signal the problem",
      " Similar incidents have been occurred last year during the international sports events where a song linked with Hong Kong's violent unrest in 2019 was played in the place of the Chinese national anthem, led to strong protest by the HKSAR government",
      "\"The IIHF has interviewed the necessary organizing committee staff / volunteers involved in the incident and have determined that the incident was not intentional, but rather an inadvertent error,\" the federation told the Global Times in an email",

      "Together with all the above mentioned the incident was acknowledged at the post game tournament directorate meeting by the president and general secretary of the organizing committee, as well as the IIHF tournament chairperson, the IIHF said",
      " \"An apology was made to Team Hong Kong representative at the directorate meeting, and it was immediately accepted,\" it noted",
      "A similar incident occurred at the Rugby Sevens tournament in South Korea in 2022 when the organizers had asked each team to submit recordings of their national anthem beforehand",
      " As they did not find the file submitted by the Hong Kong team, the staff googled it and downloaded the one at the top of search results",
      "In November 2022, the HKSAR government made solemn representations to the technology giant, asking it to place China's correct national anthem \"March of the Volunteers\" as the top search term after inputting the keywords \"Hong Kong\" and \"national anthem,\" rather than the song linked to the social turmoil in Hong Kong in 2019",
      "However, Google denied the HKSAR government's request and reportedly said it could not do anything as the search result is based on an algorithm without any human input",

      " US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R",
      " Sherman said on February 15 local time that the US and China have \"never stopped communicating and trying to understand each other,\" adding \"we believe in the power of diplomacy to prevent miscalculations that can lead to conflict",
      "\" The day before, US Vice President Kamala Harris said she doesn't believe that this month's Chinese spy balloon episode should harm diplomatic relations",
      " \"We seek competition, but not conflict or confrontation",
      "\" Some US media interpreted this as \"one of the clearest public efforts\" made by Washington to prevent the balloon incident from further fermenting",
      "This really corresponds to the saying: If it has to be like this now, it's a pity it was ever like it in the beginning",
      " When the US ignored China's opposition and insisted on shooting down a Chinese civilian unmanned airship that strayed into US airspace due to force majeure, and repeatedly shot down so-called UFOs, the US has actually set itself up at an altitude of 10,000 meters, making it difficult to \"softly land",
      "\" Facts have shown that it is easy to inflame the atmosphere, but it is very difficult to defuse it, and Washington's actions have to be bound and shackled by it",
      " The US is in an awkward position of its own making",
      "Even today, some politicians in the US Congress are still using the issue to stir up trouble",
      " The House of Representatives recently passed the so-called resolution on China's use of a high-altitude balloon over US territory to carry out malicious hype",
      " They want to extract the last drop of political value from this accidental and unexpected incident between China and the US",
      " In this regard, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress of China issued a statement on February 16, expressing strong condemnation and firm opposition",
      " However, in the mixed messages sent by the US side, it's clear that some people, including the US administration, want to cool down",
      "After a period of turmoil, some people in the US government have gradually regained their composure and realized that turning an accident into an incident would not end well",
      " There has also been an increase in public reflection",
      " The Washington Post commented that breathlessness over a balloon has revealed more about US politics than Chinese policies",
      " The Biden administration is failing to turn it into a diplomatic opportunity, afraid of looking soft on China, it said",
      " The New York Times questioned that US-China relations keep getting worse",
      " Do they have to? The article believes that the reaction to the \"balloon incident\" is yet another example of exaggerating the \"China threat",
      "\" These opinions are largely directed toward the US government",
      "More and more Americans are realizing that the way the US government handled the balloon incident was problematic",
      " The consequences of overreacting and making a fuss are clearly detrimental to the US, and the outside world can sense their exhaustion with the relentless hype of the \"China threat\" theory",
      " In the context of a severe lack of mutual trust between China and the US, both sides have to be prepared to face potential unexpected disturbances at any time, just like this balloon incident",
      " This is a test of the diplomatic wisdom and political capabilities of both sides",
      " It has to be said that the overall performance of the US in the balloon incident is not at all what one would expect from a mature great power",
      " It appears both despicable and ridiculous",
      "Throughout the entire incident, facing the exaggerated performance of condemnation and sanctions from the US, China has always exercised the utmost restraint and rationality",
      " As the situation developed, China's diplomatic professionalism, responsible attitude, and strategic composure in stabilizing US-China relations were increasingly evident",
      " On the contrary, Washington has raised its tone too high, and this drama is getting hard to sing along",
      " It is inevitable that it would end up becoming its own tormentor",
      "Senior officials of the US government have always said that differences should be well managed and guardrails should be added to China-US relations",
      " However, this accident, which was clearly manageable, has led to an unmanageable diplomatic turmoil under the impetus of the US government",
      " In the current political environment of the US, pragmatic rationality has given way to populist sentiment, economic cooperation has given way to political manipulation, and friendship has given way to prejudice",
      " How does that reassure the international community?We hope that it is not only the failed farce of the \"balloon incident\" that can calm Washington down, it should reflect on much more",
      " Anyone with a discerning eye in the international community can clearly see its willful behavior",

      "The brigade also uses a 3D simulation training system for urban warfare, which looks not unlike a video game, to train the troops, according to the report",

      " Uncle Sam's overreaction",
      " Cartoon: Carlos LatuffDuring his visit to Europe, Wang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, made a sharp criticism regarding the \"balloon incident",
      "\" He said that Chinese unmanned civilian airship deviated from its planned course and entered US airspace due to force majeure, and this is an isolated and unexpected accident that should have been handled in a calm, rational and professional manner",
      " However, the US side has ignored the basic facts and continued to confuse the public, and this almost hysterical act of the US has shown that its prejudice and ignorance towards China has reached a preposterous level",
      "The \"balloon incident\" has been brewing for a while, and the facts are already very clear",
      " Wang accurately defined the US practices in three phrases: abusing force, overreacting and hyping the situation",
      " This is a solid conclusion based on facts and international law",
      " The whole incident was a case of the US abusing force, politicizing and magnifying a random accidental event, and smearing China",
      " The US has not only escalated the issue but also confused the international community",
      " Therefore, it is necessary for us to repeat what is right and what is wrong in this not so complicated accident to the world, in a bid to ensure a correct understanding of the facts",
      "There are precedents for this kind of incident, but no one has been as unprofessional as the US",
      " Here are several key facts that need to be reiterated: first, this was a civilian unmanned airship; second, the airship entered US airspace due to force majeure; third, the airship posed no threat to the US; and fourth, China communicated with the US about the accidental entry",
      " That is to say China has always strictly adhered to the relevant provisions of international law and acted with a highly responsible attitude",
      " However, the US chose the most violent and drastic way of handling the situation - wielding military force instead of law enforcement force, using advanced fighter jets and firing missiles to shoot down the unmanned airship, which violates both the Article 2(4) UN Charter that \"All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force\" and the principles of necessity and proportionality in the international practice regarding the use of force",
      " It is a typical case of abuse of force",
      "According to the provisions of Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), civilian unmanned airship has the same legal status as civil aircraft",
      " This Convention can totally be used as a reference to handle the matter calmly, rationally, and professionally, and based on which, according to customary international law, when civil aircraft are affected by force majeure such as weather and mechanical failures, they may enter the airspace of the other party without being considered as intruding other's airspace, that is, it is not illegal and there is no need to bear international responsibility",
      "The US responded to the civilian unmanned airship and the \"unidentified flying object\" that posed no threat by deploying multiple fighter jets",
      " Moreover, it closed airspace and hyped the incident both domestically and internationally in a way similar to live broadcasts",
      " Afterwards, the US Congress also passed relevant resolutions",
      " Such a high-profile hype clearly stems from politicized ulterior motivations",
      " As previously pointed out in our editorial, this is an absurd and expensive large-scale political behavioral art",
      "It is important to emphasize that the behavioral art performed by the world's top military power is not just a show for the American public; it is also perilous and could even lead to unexpected conflicts",
      " What we are witnessing is a country with the world's biggest destructive power showing little restraint in its destructive capabilities and exhibiting an excessively neurotic reaction to an accidental event",
      " This means huge risks for the world",
      "US fighter jets later fired missiles to shoot down three \"unidentified flying objects,\" only to find that they had nothing to do with China and may be used for meteorological or entertainment related purposes",
      " The US manifestly ignored the internationally accepted practice of distinguishing between military and civilian purpose",
      " A few days ago, a club of hobbyists called the Northern Illinois Bottlecap Balloon Brigade claimed that the flying objects shot down by US fighter jets over Canadian airspace could be theirs",
      " But this did not alleviate controversy about the US' excessive use of force",
      " Some US hobbyists believe that the US government officials \"overreacted,\" and others pointed out, \"When they shot them down, they didn't know what they were",
      " That's a little concerning",
      "\"US' abuse of force this time has set an extremely bad and dangerous precedent and intensified the entire global situation",
      " Wang pointed out in Munich that What the US needs to do is demonstrate sincerity, and face up to and resolve the damage that this incident has brought to China-US relations",
      " To be honest, it is not only the Chinese people who object to the US' practice; the whole world is concerned about a US like this",
      " After all, missiles are not used for fun, and Washington's abuse of force will surely arouse the international community's vigilance",

      "Night after night, the sound of firecrackers continued until the 15th day of the first month of the lunar calendar",
      " The dim sum restaurants resumed their usual popularity, and the temple became more crowded with worshippers standing shoulder to shoulder",
      "Friends told me that in Guangdong, the temple's burning incense is an important \"index\" to predict the economic heat",
      " It has gone beyond religious beliefs and become a cultural and social tradition",
      " Through the incense, you can see the people's expectations for the coming year",
      "In Guangzhou, the neighborhood where I live was built on the site of the original Guangzhou Iron and Steel Factory, which represented the industrial system initially established in new China",
      " In 2014, the New York Times published a story with the poignant tone of the headline: \"As Steel Mill Closes, Guangzhou Loses a Piece of Its History",
      "\" I wish the writer of this article would come back for a second look",
      "Today a new residential town has been built here, with tall buildings and stores",
      " The best high school in Guangzhou has also opened a branch here",
      " Some of the old blast furnaces and plants of the steel mill have been preserved and will become a heritage park, while a museum is under construction next to it",
      " A security guard told me that over the years, former workers of this factory kept coming here to visit",
      "An old steel mill closed, but China not only has the world's largest steel industry in terms of production, but also consumes the most steel products",
      " 10 years ago when I interviewed Jose Carlos Martins, the executive president of Vale, the largest miner in Brazil, he proudly said that in many of the tall buildings in China, there are \"Brazilian stones",
      "\" The stone he was talking about was iron ore",
      "When I talked to the residents around me, there was never any talk about the \"big issues\" of the world, but only the \"small issues\" that are closely related to people's lives and their families, such as the adjustment of medical insurance, children's education and the price of vegetables",
      "Guangdong was the first region in China to open up",
      " It also has very close people-to-people ties with the outside world",
      " Guangdong's development has always been supported by overseas Chinese",
      " If you talk to the local people in Guangdong today about the economy, they will tell you about things related to foreign cooperation",
      "Although the pursuit of wealth is still the main preoccupation of many ordinary people, they now don't have the same state of mind as when they or their fathers started their businesses",
      " Times are different, but the Chinese people's pursuit of a better life has not changed, and the belief that life will become better, which has been unleashed since the reform and opening-up, has remained even more unchanged",
      " And a happy future, in their view, can only be achieved through the peaceful development of the country",
      "In the past few days, China has released the Global Security Initiative Concept Paper",
      " It would be an understatement to consider this constructive document to promote peaceful global development as a mere opinion of the Chinese government",
      "This initiative is based on the Chinese people's practice of development and going global since reform and opening-up",
      " It reflects the voice of the Chinese people, and moreover, the needs of the people in their daily life",
      "It tells the world what kind of world order the over 1",
      "4 billion Chinese want",
      " Looking back at the history of the rise of the global powers, we will see that the Chinese pursuit is unique",
      " In the rise of old European colonial powers like Britain, development was always linked to global plunder and colonialism",
      " There is no European power whose colonial expansion was not accompanied by bloody killings",
      "Many ordinary people in Britain built their happiness and good life as well as the realization of their dreams of wealth and prosperity on overseas plundering",
      " This passion for taking risks, killing and plundering has even been celebrated as the \"spirit of the sea\" necessary for the rise of any great nation",
      "The key to understanding the Chinese initiative lies in truly understanding what the Chinese people want and are seeking",
      " Peaceful development for the Chinese is not just an idea, but an innate worldview engraved in their bones and blood",

      " Tan Kefei, the seventh spokesperson of China's Ministry of National Defense",
      " Photo: website of Ministry of National DefenseThe Chinese Defense Ministry on Sunday protested against the US' move to shoot down a Chinese civilian unmanned airship which made an unintended entry into the US airspace due to force majeure",
      " Experts said that US' reaction could escalate tensions between the two countries' militaries",
      "The US' attack on Chinese civilian unmanned airship by force is an obvious overreaction, Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, a spokesperson at China's Ministry of National Defense, said in a statement on Sunday",
      "Tan's statement came after an F-22 fighter of the US Air Force fired an AIM-9X air-to-air missile and shot down the balloon, the Pentagon said on the day on its website, despite admitting that the balloon did not pose a military or physical threat",
      "The balloon in question is a Chinese unmanned civilian airship used mainly for meteorological research purposes which made an unintended entry into the US airspace due to force majeure, namely the Westerlies and the airship's limited self-steering capability, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Friday",
      "From a technical point of view, the US' move is like shooting a mosquito with a cannon, which is not only overreacting but also impractical, a Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "Compared with an unmanned, unpowered balloon that flies with the wind, the US interception method that featured an advanced stealth fighter jet and fired a missile is too costly",
      " If more balloons, not necessarily from China, fly across the US, the US Air Force would be exhausted in intercepting them in this way, the expert said",
      "It is more of a political show, as the balloon was only shot down after it already travelled across the US and was about to leave, observers said",
      "China sternly protests against this move and reserves rights to take necessary measures in dealing with similar situations, Tan said",
      "Tan's remark means that if a foreign airship accidentally enters the Chinese airspace, the Chinese forces could also shoot it down in a similar manner, and the US move will significantly impact the two countries' military-to-military relations, observers said",
      "It is widely known that US aircraft, appearing in civilian or military purposes, operate around China much more frequent than Chinese aircraft do around the US, L\u00fc Xiang, an expert on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "If the US does not differentiate between civilian and military aircraft, then it has made a very bad precedent in treating the China-US relations, L\u00fc said",
      "The US frequently conducts close-in reconnaissance on China's doorsteps in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Straits and the East China Sea, sometimes in civilian disguises, according to think tanks and media reports",
      "\"If the US does not make the difference, should China make a difference? Should China also take reciprocal measures? The US must carefully consider the consequences\" L\u00fc said",

      " Through this window, international observers closely watch China's moves and recognize China's development",
      "John Pang (Pang), a former Malaysian government official and a senior research fellow at Perak Academy, Malaysia, told Global Times (GT) reporter Li Aixin that \"people-centered development works because it's rooted in reality, not political display,\" and it has brought Chinese people a sense of security and ease with themselves in the modern world",
      "This is the third interview of this series over the two sessions",
      "GT: China emphasizes adhering to the people-centered philosophy in its governance, regarding\u2002improving\u2002the\u2002well-being\u2002of\u2002the\u2002people\u2002and\u2002promoting\u2002well-rounded\u2002human development\u2002as\u2002the\u2002starting\u2002point\u2002and\u2002foothold\u2002of\u2002its\u2002development",
      " In your opinion, what is \"people-centered\"?Pang: The idea of the people as the root, foundation and center of the Chinese order lies at the core of Chinese political philosophy",
      " The classical reference is a phrase in the Book of Documents: \"The people are the foundation of a country and only when the people lead a good life can the country thrive",
      "\"The phrase describes more than \"political theory\" in the modern sense",
      " It employs the classical Chinese political ontology of the people; of human beings in their individual, social and elemental reality; living and acting between heaven and earth; in their social relations and interactions with the natural world, within a moral universe",
      " This phrase suggests the continuity between Chinese political modernity and its deep past",
      "It is, in classical Western terms, a philosophy of the common good",
      " The good of the people implied by the phrase is not the aggregation of their individual preferences",
      " It is their indivisible good as a community, their flourishing as a people",
      " This common flourishing, or happiness, is the condition and the fulfillment of individual happiness",
      "It implies that Chinese governance today as in the past is more than mere representation of an abstract will of the people, a formula that, in the West has become a facade for oligarchy",
      " The people are the entire purpose and meaning of government",
      " Those who govern serve only that common good",
      " They are to have no interest of their own",
      " This implies the cultivation of the virtues of leadership and public service",
      " Public officials are to be driven by \"lofty ideals and firm convictions,\" to be willing to sacrifice their lives in service, to seek moral and intellectual progress through rigorous and lifelong self-cultivation, and attention to practical results through \"seeking truth from facts",
      "\" This notion of governance requires, in other words, the virtues of public service that have been prized in Chinese political culture for millennia",
      "The test of people-centered governance is objective: It consists in whether the well-being of the people has been objectively improved and their aspirations have been met",
      "GT: When it comes to people-centered\u2002development, has China made it?Pang: COVID was an acid test of government commitment to the welfare of the people all over the world",
      " The pandemic mercilessly revealed the actual priorities and capacities of governments all over the world",
      " We learned the importance of social cohesion and trust and government capacity to address emergencies",
      " Some struggled in disarray",
      " Some were seen to save corporations and seek profit as millions died",
      " China, without question, put people first",
      "Poll after poll shows a deepening loss of trust in government in the advanced liberal democracies",
      " We see growing signs of social breakdown",
      " In contrast, Chinese society is flourishing",
      " People trust the government and each other even more now than before the pandemic",
      " Chinese people enjoy social peace and stability and prosperity and remain optimistic about the future despite unprecedented threats",
      "People-centered development works because it's rooted in reality, not political display",
      " It attends practically to what needs to be done",
      " It has a strong pragmatic bent in methodically and iteratively \"seeking truth from facts\" and acting on it",
      " It has brought the \"hundred surnames,\" the ordinary people beloved of Chinese philosophers, a sense of security and ease with themselves in the modern world that they have not enjoyed for more than a century",
      " By rekindling its continuity with the past, Chinese governance today also connects all Chinese people to the world in peace",
      " This is an inestimable contribution to their common good and to the world",
      "Let me take a step back",
      "At the beginning of the 20th century, a looted, divided China faced the modern world in the wake of the collapse of the longest lasting, and for most of its history, the most populous political order in the world",
      " This order had sustained a continuous socio-political community over 4,000 years, with norms, ideals, and meanings deeply embedded in that continuity",
      " Chinese people faced something worse than personal death point: the loss of a world",
      " My grandfather was born in the last year of that classical world, a subject of the last imperial dynasty",
      " The collapse of this world brought everything the Chinese fear in chaos: war, mass death, destruction, hunger and displacement",
      "The question of the relationship between Chinese people and their history is thus no mere academic issue",
      " It is an existential, moral and spiritual question faced by every thinking Chinese person",
      "The framing of modern Chinese statecraft in classical terms is thus a landmark moment",
      " It marks Chinese socialist modernity finding its continuity with Chinese political history, China reconnecting itself to its past, finding its place in the present, and seeking to contribute to world civilization",
      " It marks the continuity of the Chinese world",
      "GT: Some analysts think people-centered approach is the fundamental difference between Chinese modernization and Western modernization",
      " What is your take? And what is Western modernization centered on?Pang: People-centered governance repudiates the liberal individualism at the heart of Western modernity",
      " It is based on a notion of the good of the people that has, however, strong affinities with the classical Western notion of the bonum commune, the common good",
      "The ideology of the modern West is liberalism",
      " In its contemporary form it admits no notion of the common good",
      " In its view the \"common good\" is only shorthand for the aggregate of separate and individual utilities",
      " There is no people\uff01Only the individual, and individual's will and desire, are real",
      "Its fundamental principle is the autonomy of the individual, secured by ever greater liberation from all constraints",
      " As the great American jurist Adrian Vermeule has noted, modern liberalism, as a sociopolitical order, pursues relentlessly the destruction of all traditional norms, customs, mores and institutions",
      " While deeming itself the antithesis of religion, it is itself driven by a quasi-religious impulse to publicly celebrate the destruction of all traditional ways of understanding what it means to be human",
      " It recognizes no boundary to its claims, making ever stricter demands for political conformity at home and abroad",
      " It is the ideological handmaiden of an equally expansionary global capitalism and imperialism",
      "In drawing on \"people-centrism,\" Chinese modernization cultivates the common good",
      " It's not surprising that we see an astonishing revival of social trust in the country",
      " This would not have been possible in a society that pursued Western-style development",
      "John Pang",
      " Photo: Courtesy of PangGT: How do you comment on the hypes of some Western media and politicians about so-called China's human rights issue?Pang: The allegations are so absurd at this point that I would just ignore them",
      "Let's distinguish human rights as a concept from human rights as a global political project",
      " Although the concept first began to be used in the 1940s, it grew into a global political project of the West only from the 1970s",
      " It is not as if no society practiced justice or enacted laws protecting human life before this",
      " Justice and compassion, articulated in different philosophical vocabularies, are part of our common humanity",
      " The concept of human rights instrumentalizes this common humanity in service of the politics of liberal internationalism by giving itself the right to intervene over any state sovereignty",
      " It is today's white man's burden",
      "Legal rights are bounded claims that can only be secured by functioning sovereign states",
      " As an instrument of the unipolar order, the freestanding notion of \"human rights,\" applied with invincible hypocrisy, is used to justify Western coercion",
      " This power recognizes no legal or political limits",
      " In principle, the self-appointed custodians of human rights license themselves to intervene in any state in the world",
      " In practice it has made the Western military alliance the greatest threat to the international system of sovereign states",
      "The true face of human rights as a liberal international project is the destruction of Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria",
      " Each of the territories that the West has \"liberated\" for its freestanding (and stateless) notion of human rights has ended up as near stateless or actually stateless zones reduced to chaos, rife with warlordism and terrorism",
      " Millions have died and tens of millions displaced by the gift of human rights",
      " Thanks to \"human rights,\" we once again have slave markets in Libya",
      "The emperor is of naked",
      " To take these allegations seriously is to pretend he is clothed",
      "GT: Does \"putting the people at the center\" also have referential value for international relations?Pang: People-centred philosophy is inherently cosmopolitan",
      " The Confucian humanism underlying Chinese statecraft applied seamlessly to domestic governance and diplomacy",
      " Human community with a shared future is the international application of people-centred governance",
      " The human community of the ancient Chinese world was not a national community in the modern sense",
      " The principle of common good underlying it applies universally",
      " Its final end is the shared good of the entire human community",
      " There is a phrase from the Book of Rites \"When the Great Way was pursued, the world was held in common",
      "\" It points to the great vision of Great Unity of all under heaven, the universal community that Chinese governance has always seen as the necessary end, or fulfillment, of all particular community",
      " This is nothing less than the human community of a shared future",
      "GT: What are your expectations for the ongoing two sessions? How do you think the people-centered philosophy in its governance will be reflected in the two sessions?Pang: I hope to see people-centered philosophy discussed in a way that shows its relationship with China's vision of global order, its commitment to peace and development",
      " This doctrine is as distinctive as it is universal in its vision of the common good",
      "Meanwhile, I think it's a major development that China has begun to issue more comprehensive and direct statements to the world community such as the paper on the Global Security Initiative",
      " They're much needed as the world beyond NATO struggles to secure a multipolar order against increasingly deranged threats",
      " I hope to see more articulations of an alternative to the liberal international order and to liberal modernity and a peaceful path beyond them",
      " The global diplomatic initiative for peace has already fallen on China",

      " Photo: VCGEditor's Note:In a recent article, former Australia diplomat John Lander (Lander) argued that \"The United States is not preparing to go to war against China",
      " The United States is preparing Australia to go to war against China",
      "\" Under what circumstances will Australia become a proxy of the US? What lessons could Australia learn from Ukraine? Global Times (GT) reporter Wang Wenwen talked to Lander over these issues",
      " Lander worked in 1971-72 in the Department of Foreign Affairs upon Australia's recognition of the People's Republic of China",
      " He was director of the China section of the department on three separate occasions in the years following his posting to Beijing",
      " He was personally responsible for negotiating the establishment of consular relations between the two countries",
      " He also commented on the China policy adopted by the Albanese government",
      "GT: In your latest article, you said that \"the US is not preparing to go to war against China, but it is preparing Australia to go to war against China",
      "\" Under what circumstances will Australia become a proxy of the US?Lander: We are already a proxy of the US",
      " The United States has now established an extremely large military footprint in Australia",
      " It now describes Australia as the most important base for the projection of US power in the Indo-Pacific",
      " The United States has not abandoned its determination to maintain its supremacy in the world, in particular, its control of world banking and finance",
      " The so-called threat from China, which is frequently described in military terms, is not, in fact, a military threat by China at all",
      " It is a challenge more than a threat by China to the US domination of the international financial system",
      "In its determination to preserve its hegemonic position, the United States has made it very clear that it will use all means, including military means, to sustain its position as No",
      "1",
      " It also has made it very clear in many statements that in regard to the principal adversaries, as it calls Russia and China, both of whom are nuclear armed states, it will not engage directly in war with either",
      " It will conduct its wars against Russia and against China by proxy",
      "The US has a fallback position of developing Australia as an alternative proxy adversary against China",
      " We went along with that",
      " Under the previous government, we were saying if Taiwan were to be attacked, then Australia would have to come to the defense of Taiwan, and we would be involved",
      " So we had already accepted the United States' plan to involve China in a war, specifically conducted in such a manner as to enable the United States to continually pretend that it itself is not actually engaged in such a war",
      "Many of the military personnel from US Defense Secretary Austin down through various admirals and generals have been talking about the necessity to prepare for war against China",
      " But although it has been interpreted by most observers as being statements that the United States is preparing it to go to war itself directly against China, I do not believe it is the case",
      " America's involvement would be under the proxy arrangement to support Australia in the conduct of the conflict",
      " And I don't see anything that really would change my view of where we are headed",
      "GT: What lessons could Australia learn from Ukraine?Lander: It is clearly demonstrated by the war in Ukraine that the United States is prepared to sacrifice a so-called ally in pursuit of its own interests",
      " The obvious lesson is to not allow ourselves to be used as a proxy",
      " Australia would gain absolutely nothing from engaging as a proxy for the United States in a war against China",
      "But at the moment, there is no one that I can see in our ruling elite, in the government, that appears to be willing to say no to the United States",
      " There are plenty of reasons including historic ones",
      " Most politicians in power in Australia are still afraid of the influence that America could exert in Australia to basically cause them to lose office",
      " America is extremely skilled at conducting regime change operations all around the world",
      " I think if Australia were to defy the United States, we would find ourselves in trouble in terms of potential destabilizing in Australia",
      "John Lander Photo: Courtesy of Lander GT: How will the AUKUS agreement compromise Australian sovereignty?Lander: It is indeed not the AUKUS agreement",
      " There is no written document",
      " There's no formal agreement",
      " It is not a treaty",
      " It is not even a pact",
      " It has not been reviewed in any detail by either the parliament or the people and has never been voted on",
      " It is a sort of gentlemen's agreement (if you could call them gentlemen) between the British prime minister, the American president, and the Australian prime minister",
      " Simply, they gave a name to a process which has been going on under the auspices of the ANZUS treaty for many years",
      "The legal instrument by which Australia's sovereignty has been handed over to the United States is, in fact, the Force Posture Agreement of 2014, which makes it extremely explicit that any US assets, anything it develops as a base, anything that it equips as a base, any personnel or munitions or any other military assets, which it locates in such bases, are under the complete and unchallenged authority of the United States",
      "It makes it very clear that all of this militarization in the north of Australia is under United States control",
      " And Australia has absolutely no say whatsoever in how, when or why such facilities would be used, which leads most reasonably sane and realistic observers are looking at the implications of the Force Posture Agreement to say Australia would inevitably be dragged in if the United States went to war against China",
      "Also under this vague veil of the AUKUS, it is now being declared that United States forces would be wholly interchangeable with Australian defense forces",
      " We already have American military personnel in our defense policymaking and in the command positions within the Australian defense force",
      " But interchangeable, I think, is a very important word, because it makes it clear that anything American in Australia can immediately be used as Australian",
      " The militarization of northern Australia is, I believe, actually designed to make it possible to ensure that Australia will, in fact, be at war against China at some point in the not too distant future, whilst America can stand off on the sidelines and say they are not directly involved; they must help our ally by pouring in more and more weapons, materiel and ammunition, but still maintaining the pretence that they're not directly engaged in the actual war",
      " I see this is the most likely scenario",
      "We have the alliance with the United States in order to feel secure",
      " But it has long ceased to serve that purpose",
      "So Australia's greatest protection against us being involved in a war against China is, in fact, China itself",
      " As long as China is able to continue showing the extreme forbearance that has shown to the military provocations by the United States (and indeed Australia) within China's coastal waters and over China's airspace, and refrains from reacting to that in the same manner that the United States reacted to a rather innocuous balloon that floated over the United States, war can be avoided",
      " China could have used exactly the same language to justify its more extreme measures against surveillance aircraft flying over China than it has so far taken",
      "GT: How can Australia walk out of the paradox that Australia needs the US for its defense, but it only needs defending because of the US?Lander: The United States has never regarded the ANZUS treaty as a guarantee that the United States would, under all circumstances, actively defend Australia",
      " The ANZUS only provides for consultations between us and the United States as to the best means of assisting Australia in its defense",
      " But it makes it very clear that Australia has to defend itself",
      " Whereas Australian governments, almost without exception, have regarded the ANZUS alliance as a guarantee of Australia's security, which in a war, it would not be such guarantee",
      " It's a kind of psychological security blanket which we have never really grown up to and let go of",
      " We desperately cling to this security blanket and thereby create the opportunity for the United States to turn Australia into its forward military base in the Indo-Pacific",
      "It would be extraordinarily difficult for Australia to even step back slightly from the current implications of our alliance with the United States",
      " I don't think the United States would allow us to walk away entirely",
      " And I don't think any Australian government would have the political courage to rescind the Force Posture Agreement",
      " It will take many years of active opposition by the Australian people to the direction that the government is going for the government to change direction",
      "There may very well be global developments, which are really obviate any necessity to do that in terms of the impending change to the global international financial order, the impact that will have on the United States dollar, the impact that will have on the United States economy and developments within the United States itself as a result of its own economic dysfunction",
      " We just don't know what will come first",
      "Australia is caught in many paradoxes",
      " Australia is still talking about having to go to war against China in order to protect our trade with China, which is an absurdity",
      " We also have the irony that Australia can only afford to buy nuclear powered submarines from the United States so long as it continues to earn massive profits from China - the Australian budget depends it to very large extent on the income from our trade with China",
      "GT: How do you evaluate the China policy adopted by the Albanese administration?Lander: The Albanese government is on the one hand endeavouring to improve diplomatic relations and trading relations, whilst on the other hand, it still goes along with the United States in building up a war capability against China, which is, likewise, basically a paradox",
      "China has consistently over the last almost 10 years, certainly over the last 5 years, in every single statement it has made about Australia or message that it has delivered to Australia, stated the wish to have a collaborative, productive and mutually beneficial relationship with Australia, which if Australia had any sense, it would reach for the same thing",
      "That does not mean that Australia and China should agree on everything",
      " We have differences and some of those differences could not be ironed out",
      " But we could take the same position as China of not allowing those differences to impede the development of collaboration in areas where we could see eye to eye",
      "Penny Wong, as foreign minister, I think, is trying very hard to reassert the role of diplomacy in bilateral relations, not only with China, but with most of the rest of the world",
      " She has an extraordinarily difficult job, because the other political forces in Australia, particularly the forces within the so-called defense establishment, are always pushing her in the opposite direction",
      "It's going to take quite a lot of time and quite a lot of hard work to stabilize and then further develop the relationship in a positive direction",
      " China is able to make a contribution",
      " I believe that China can afford to be magnanimous and gradually remove some of the impediments to some of the Australian exports to China, which would go a long way toward constructing more goodwill in Australia toward China",

      " Photo: VCGChina remains committed to an independent foreign policy of peace and to peaceful development, pursues friendship and cooperation with other countries, and stands ready to work with the international community to put into action the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and the Global Security Initiative (GSI), Premier Li Keqiang said in his Government Work Report delivered during the first session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) on Sunday",
      "Some Chinese experts believe that pursuing peace and pushing forward peaceful development are the biggest characteristics of China's foreign policy, and the GDI and GSI are China's solutions to tackling many urgent global issues",
      " Meanwhile, China will continue retaining the \"fighting spirit\" in its foreign policy, aiming to safeguard its legitimate rights in sovereignty, security and development",
      "However, some Western media consider that the \"fighting spirit\" is a sign that China's foreign policy is becoming more aggressive",
      " Chinese officials and experts refuted such interpretation during the ongoing two sessions",
      " Some experts said that such allegations reflect the West's hype of the so-called China threat that contradicts the reality, and that China has to fight back against unreasonable containment and unilateral sanctions imposed by certain major countries to safeguard its own rights",
      "Over the past five years, we conducted major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics on all fronts, Premier Li said in his report",
      " President Xi Jinping and other Party and state leaders have visited many countries and attended, online or offline, many major diplomatic events, including G20 summits, APEC economic leaders' meetings, high-level meetings commemorating the 75th anniversary of the UN, the East Asia leaders' meetings on cooperation, and China-EU summits, Li noted",
      "China has also hosted a number of major diplomatic events, including the Qingdao Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the 14th BRICS Summit, the High-Level Dialogue on Global Development, the first and second Belt and Road forums for international cooperation, and the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, according to the Government Work Report",
      "With courage and the ability to stand our ground, we resolutely safeguarded China's sovereignty, security, and development interests",
      " We actively expanded global partnerships, worked to build an open world economy, safeguarded multilateralism, and promoted the building of a human community with a shared future, Li said",
      "In laying out recommendations for the work of the government in 2023, Li said China should stay committed to an independent foreign policy of peace and to peaceful development, and pursue friendship and cooperation with other countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence",
      "\"We should remain firm in pursuing a strategy of opening up for mutual benefit",
      " We should continue working to safeguard world peace, contribute to global development, and uphold the international order,\" he said",
      "China stands ready to work with the international community to put into action the GDI and the GSI and promote the shared values of humanity, Li said",
      "\"The biggest characteristic of China's foreign policy is pursuing peace, which is also the ultimate target of our development and security planning,\" Li Haidong, a professor with the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "Those two initiatives are China's solutions to tackling global and regional hot issues including poverty alleviation, tackling climate change and resolving disputes between countries to form a pattern that is conducive to peace and common development for all countries, which is fair, reasonable and better than that of the US-led West, Li Haidong said",
      "Based on GSI, China unveiled the GSI Concept Paper on February 21 amid the growing risks and challenges the world faces today, especially in light of the Ukraine crisis",
      " In the concept paper, China emphasizes that a nuclear war cannot be won and countries should remain committed to peacefully resolving differences and disputes through dialogue and consultation",
      "China also calls on all countries to practice true multilateralism, resist a Cold War mentality, unilateralism, bloc confrontation and hegemonism",
      "However, some Western media and observers have been interpreting China safeguarding its legitimate rights as an aggressive act",
      "In response to a question about China's \"Foreign Relations Law,\" which stipulates that China could take countermeasures and restrictions when necessary, from a foreign reporter who also asked will Chinese diplomacy become increasingly aggressive, Wang Chao, spokesperson for the first session of the 14th NPC, said at a press conference on Saturday that it is totally justifiable and necessary for China to make legislative efforts to counter containment, suppression and interference from external forces",
      "\"Over the past few years, certain major countries have been continuously containing China, drawing up blocs by values and ideologies and hurt our interests by imposing unilateral sanctions, and under such circumstances, we have to take countermeasures,\" Su Xiaohui, deputy director of the Department of International and Strategic Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "\"Such a fighting spirit is not aggressive but legitimate",
      " China's diplomacy serves our domestic development",
      " We need to develop stable and harmonious relations with neighboring countries and major countries and make as many friends as possible in the world,\" Su said",
      "When it comes to China's alleged diplomatic \"fight,\" it is not China taking the initiative to fight",
      " \"If there are some countercurrents in the world, in terms of maintaining international rules, China has to fight to safeguard its own interests while also promoting the long-term development of the world,\" she said",

      " We should enhance the intensity and effectiveness of our proactive fiscal policy",
      " We should do more to implement a prudent monetary policy in a targeted way",
      " Social policies should meet basic living needs",
      "",
      "",
      " In the Government Work Report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang on March 5, a series of key targets and policy directions have provided an important window for observing China's future development",
      " In particular, the economic growth target of around 5 percent has sparked heated discussions both domestically and internationally",
      "It is worth noting that the international community generally believes that the 5 percent target is \"moderate,\" \"gentle,\" and \"cautious",
      "\" In other words, it is lower than the expected target from the outside world",
      " Previously, international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, and the domestic economic community had expected China's GDP growth rate in 2023 to be around 5 percent or even higher",
      " This to some extent shows that both within and outside China, there is optimism about China's economic trend in 2023, which is a good phenomenon",
      "In fact, 5 percent is not low",
      " China's GDP in 2022 has already reached a high of 121 trillion yuan, and 5 percent is equivalent to 6 trillion yuan, which is an increase exceeding the GDP of most countries in the world",
      " Looking at the international institutions' expectations for global economic growth in 2023, it is approximately between 2",
      "7 percent and 2",
      "9 percent",
      " It can be seen that the overall situation globally is not good",
      " The US' economic growth is projected at only 0",
      "5 percent, Germany's 0",
      "2 percent, and the UK economy will contract by 0",
      "6 percent",
      " China's 5 percent growth is still the strongest growth engine",
      "The Government Work Report also summarized the work of the past year and the past five years",
      " GDP growth in 2022 was 3 percent, and the average annual GDP growth in the past five years was 5",
      "2 percent",
      " China's GDP has reached $121 trillion yuan",
      " When reporting on this, the media almost always used the words \"extremely unusual\" and \"extraordinary",
      "\" In the past few years, China has faced many challenges that exceeded expectations",
      " Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, we have united, strived to overcome difficulties and reached an achievement that is not easily obtained, demonstrating the great resilience of the Chinese economy",
      "Entering 2023, this great resilience and vitality have been further released",
      " The healthy rebound of the Chinese economy has significantly increased the confidence of the outside world in the Chinese economy, and their expectations for the Chinese economy are also rising",
      " Data released on March 1 showed that China's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) hit an 11-year high in February, and economic activities are rapidly rebounding",
      " For a country as large as China to maintain steady development for so many years, this poses the most critical test to the country's governance ability",
      " It should be said that the steady leadership of those who steer the country is the key to China's stable and long-term economic development",
      " The 5 percent target is practical and leaves room for \"various risks and uncertainties that future economic growth may face",
      "\"The Government Work Report has set other development targets for this year, such as creating around 12 million new urban jobs, keeping the urban surveyed unemployment rate of around 5",
      "5 percent, and targeting increase in consumer price index (CPI) of around 3 percent",
      " Along with the economic growth target of 5 percent, they constitute the essence of China's high-quality development centered on the people",
      " It is worth emphasizing that these targets are achievable and reflect China's rational and pragmatic development attitude",
      " At the same time, if we do not work hard to achieve these targets, we will not reap the fruits",
      " These tasks are not easy, and China's entire society needs to continue to work hard and steadily move forward",
      "Every year has its own set of complex issues, but they cannot create major waves in front of China",
      " Many previous risks and challenges have ultimately been transformed into concrete breakthroughs in China's reform",
      " The evolution of hot topics during the annual two sessions can clearly reflect this",
      " For example, concerns about environmental pollution once caused widespread anxiety about China's past development model, but they have served as greater driving force for the historic reform of transitioning to new growth drivers",
      " The rapid development of the new energy industry, as well as the increase in the number of blue sky days, have become new highlights of China's economic transformation",
      " China's institutional advantage of concentrating efforts to accomplish major tasks, the government's rich experience and ability to use different policy tools for macro-control, and so on, have all been tested, consolidated, and strengthened during China's progress, continuing to exert a deep and lasting impact",
      "Among the major economies in the world, China's certainty is particularly outstanding and becoming a key driving force for global economic recovery",
      " Despite the many difficulties and challenges ahead, the overall mentality of the Chinese society is firm and confident on the path forward",
      " The Communist Party of China has led and united the Chinese people to continuously strive for a better life, which is the deep-seated driving force and source of confidence behind China's stability and progress",
      " This year's two sessions will see a change in the government's leadership",
      " Unlike in Western countries, this will not mean a policy \"U-turn",
      "\" Instead, it will open a new chapter in a great relay race, where the next leg of the journey will continue with unrelenting effort",

      " (Photo by Li Tang/Xinhua)The Zunyi, the seventh Type 055 10,000 ton-class destroyer of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, recently made its first public appearance after entering service, with analysts saying on Saturday the powerful warship is expected to become combat-ready within this year",

      "The UK branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) - a parliament group that was founded in 1911, unanimously agreed to withdraw the invitation to Hong Kong lawmakers to attend the 2023 Westminster Seminar on Effective Parliament, citing the so-called \"deteriorating situation\" in Hong Kong, according to a statement issued on Thursday",
      "The Westminster Seminar on Effective Parliaments is an opportunity to promote parliamentary democracy, and for delegates to learn more about the role of parliamentarians and parliamentary officials or clerks, as well as share knowledge and good practice with other legislatures",
      "Dominic Lee and Carmen Kan -two legislators from Hong Kong - were among those who planned to attend the event that will take place from March 13 to 17 in London, according to media reports",
      "\"We condemn the decision made by the organizing body, it is a political manipulation and an assault to our enhanced system,\" Lee told the Global Times on Saturday",
      "Besides citing the \"deteriorating situation in Hong Kong,\" the CPA statement also cited a serious erosion of political plurality and participation in Hong Kong, which, in my view, the decision by the UK \"childish,\" Lee said",
      "Since the invitation was made to Hong Kong lawmakers late last year, and since then, there has been no major change in our political system, our legislative body is still diverse, and our rule of law index is still among one of the best in the world, ranking 22nd in the World Justice Project, he said",
      "Despite that the implementation of the National Security Law for Hong Kong in June, 2020, and the electoral reform in 2021 helped bringing the city back to the correct path and helped it realize its transition from chaos to governance and further toward prosperity, several US-led Western countries have been continuously undermining the situation in Hong Kong, trying to interfere in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs",
      "For instance, in early January, the British government published its 51st six-monthly report on Hong Kong, distorting facts and grossly interfering in Hong Kong affairs, and seriously violating the basic norms governing international relations, toward which the Chinese Embassy to the UK expressed strong dissatisfaction",
      "\"Since this seminar was meant to be a platform to exchange different information about how parliaments or legislative bodies work in different jurisdiction, if you think that the system in Hong Kong is not what you have in mind, why don't you take this opportunity to understand and learn the ins and outs of our new system?\" he said",
      "\"The UK government has always stressed the importance of listening to the people of Hong Kong",
      " Being a democratically elected representative, even if I cannot represent all of Hong Kong residents, I can at least represent a good amount of them,\" Lee said",
      "\"Then why are they refusing to listen to our side of the story?\" he asked, noting that it is hypocritical for some UK politicians to claim that they are a democratic country but refuse to listen to voices from different jurisdictions",
      "\"The fact that I cannot attend this seminar is not my loss, nor is it Hong Kong's loss,\" Lee said",
      "The Hong Kong lawmaker pointed out that the UK will suffer the biggest loss by withdrawing the invitation as it will lose an opportunity to further understand Hong Kong's legislature while such political manipulation won't damage the spirit of local lawmakers",

      " Photo: AFPRussian President Vladimir Putin announced the suspension of Russia's participation in New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control pact with the US, in his State of the Nation Address to the Federal Assembly on Tuesday, a move that experts saw as an urgent call for a return to normalcy in its ties with the US and a signal of intensified confrontation between Russia and NATO",
      "Explaining his move, Putin said during the State of the Nation Address that \"in the conditions of today's confrontation, it [the pact] sounds like sheer nonsense,\" but stressed Russia was not withdrawing from it",
      "The Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (New START) treaty, signed in 2010 by then US President Barack Obama and then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers",
      " The agreement also includes a comprehensive on-site inspection to verify compliance",
      "Days before the treaty was due to expire in February 2021, Russia and the US agreed to extend it for another five years",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin commented on the matter at Wednesday's media briefing, saying that the treaty has played a key role in maintaining global strategic stability, enhancing international and regional peace and achieving the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons",
      "China notes the differences between Russia and the US on the issue of compliance and hopes the two sides will properly resolve their differences through constructive dialogue and consultation to ensure the smooth implementation of the treaty, Wang said",
      "Following Putin's announcement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that despite the decision to suspend its participation in New START, Russia will continue to comply with its quantitative limits, and will continue to exchange notifications with the US on the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles",
      "The ministry called on Washington \"to show political will and make good-faith efforts for general de-escalation and the creation of conditions for the resumption of the full functioning of the treaty",
      "\"The significance for world peace of the New START treaty is that it has a verification mechanism that will, to a certain extent, increase arms control and prevent a nuclear arms race, enhance stability among world nuclear powers, and avoid unpredictability or miscalculation, Zhang Hong, associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday",
      "However, there is not a communication channel for this verification mechanism between Russia and the US, which makes the pact itself unfeasible",
      " Under such circumstances, Russia's decision was in fact sending the US a message urging the return to normalized bilateral relations rather than endless hostilities and smearing, Zhang said",

      "The Russian president's declaration drew extensive concern over world nuclear safety",

      "While not yet in service, a number of hypersonic missile projects are underway in the US",

      "While Washington intends to deploy new weapons for US forces in Japan, Tokyo is also planning to purchase Tomahawk missiles from the US and is developing its own hypersonic missiles, according to media reports",
      "It reflects the US and Japan's obvious scheme to militarily contain China, and their intention to interfere in the Taiwan question by force, analysts said",

      " Photo:VCGThe China Coast Guard ship did not direct lasers at the Philippine crew, and the hand-held equipment did not inflict damage on anything or anyone on the vessel and the Philippines' allegation does not reflect the truth, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in Wednesday's press briefing",
      " The US is trying to use the incident to undermine China-Philippines ties and instigate tension in the South China Sea, Wang said",
      "\"As is widely known, China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands, including the Ren'ai Reef,\" Wang said",
      " The Philippines has accused a Chinese Coast Guard ship of directing a laser at one of its vessels, but according to Wang, on February 6, a Philippine Coast Guard vessel intruded into the waters adjacent to the Ren'ai Reef without Chinese permission",
      " The China Coast Guard ship was compelled to respond in accordance with law and warned the vessel to leave the area",
      "During that process, the China Coast Guard ship used a hand-held laser speed detector and hand-held greenlight pointer to measure the distance and speed of the Philippine vessel and signal directions to ensure navigation safety, Wang said",
      "\"The Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines has clarified the facts with Philippine leaders",
      " The diplomatic service and coast guards on both sides are in communication through bilateral liaison mechanisms,\" Wang noted",
      "This is the third day that the Foreign Ministry has responded to the incident",
      " Wang noted in Tuesday's press briefing that the South China Sea arbitration case brought by the Philippines was pure political drama orchestrated by the US",
      " Its so-called ruling is illegal, null and void and will have no effect whatsoever on China's claims to rights in the South China Sea",
      "According to media reports, the US has recently increased defense cooperation with the Philippines",
      " Chen Xiangmiao, director of the world navy research center at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the Philippines' dependence on the US and the West in military security has not changed",
      "Although the Philippines is pursuing independent diplomacy, it is difficult for it to bypass the US in terms of its military capability improvement or the guiding framework of its military security strategy, Chen said",
      "The Philippines' cooperation with China is based more on the needs of its own economy and people's livelihoods, Chen said",
      " The consultation mechanism with China on the South China Sea serves the stability and development of China-Philippines relations and aims to reduce the impact of the South China Sea on bilateral relations, according to Chen",
      " There are tensions in both directions in China-Philippines relations, but they don't cancel each other out, he said",
      "Another expert on the US told the Global Times that the US aims to serve its own strategic purposes by inciting intra-regional disputes in its Asia-Pacific strategy, especially by taking advantage of the dependence of some allies on the US",
      " The US will not spare any country that has even the slightest quarrel with China, and will try to amplify the frictions, said the expert",
      "\"This is a strategic approach highlighting the US' selfishness,\" the expert noted, saying the US puts the security of all countries in the region at greater risk",
      " For countries like the Philippines, excessive pandering to the US will only create antagonism between China and will not serve their own interests, he said",
      "There are also more domestic voices from the Philippines warning that the Philippines has been dragged into protracted posturing between the US and China",
      " \"We must never allow our territory to become a launch pad for an offensive attack against another state,\" former Philippine presidential spokesperson Harry Roque wrote in an article published in the Daily Tribune on February 7",

      " Illustration: Xia Qing/Global TimesThe news of a Chinese high-altitude balloon in US airspace has been hyped up by the government as an outrageous violation of US sovereign airspace",
      " Fighter jets were directed to shoot down the allegedly threatening device and three other unidentified objects",
      " Many pundits contend that the balloon's airspace transit was even \"an act of war",
      "\" Ironically, the White House acknowledged on Tuesday that the three still-unidentified aerial objects shot down by the US in the past week likely had merely a \"benign purpose",
      "\"But the public shock generated intentionally took advantage of short national memories",
      " It was in fact the US who pioneered modern global surveillance, and set the precedent for routine overflight of nations with which it was not at war",
      "The end of WWII marked the beginning of the Cold War",
      " Once the Soviet Union was in possession of nuclear weapons, the US no longer enjoyed a military monopoly",
      " Surveillance of Soviet advances in rocket and aircraft delivering nuclear weapons became critical to the US national security",
      " German breakthroughs in rocketry were copied by both WWII victors",
      "It is common knowledge that the US set the precedent for sovereign airspace violations with the U2 reconnaissance aircraft",
      " For a time, the U2 enjoyed invulnerability to Soviet radar-guided anti-aircraft missiles and interceptors at 70,000 feet",
      " But Soviet technology closed the gap and in 1960 a U2 was shot down over Soviet territory and its pilot Gary Powers was captured",
      "The risk of losing another manned reconnaissance platform and its crew was seen as an unreasonable risk",
      " Unfazed by international criticism of its violations of foreign sovereignty, the US determined that its national security interests trumped any aerospace rules of the road",
      "Instead, open sources reveal that the US developed a mothership-launched drone known as the D-21 capable of flying at 90,000 feet using technologies available in the 1960s",
      " The unmanned reconnaissance aircraft was Mach-3+ capable and able to outrun and outclimb all missiles and aircraft of its day",
      "The D-21 was still considered experimental when the US began to employ it operationally",
      " Four were flown over People's Republic of China (PRC) territory in the late 1960s and early 1970s",
      " All missions were deemed failures for various reasons",
      "Early on a D-21 caused a fatal mishap when it collided with its mothership",
      " It is noteworthy that the US not only elected to routinely overfly sovereign Chinese territory, but employed an unreliable Mach-3 drone with little regard for the safety of Chinese citizens on the ground",
      " The unmanned technologies of the 1960s proved too immature, so the US returned to manned reconnaissance missions with the Mach-3+ SR-71 high altitude reconnaissance jet",
      " For over a decade the US overflew the territories of foreign sovereign territories at 85,000+ feet with impunity",
      " The SR-71 flew too fast and too high for competitor missiles and interceptors",
      "But, as with the U2, the Soviets again closed the gap with the manned Mach-3+ MIG-31 interceptor",
      " Open sources reveal that in 1983 two MIG-31s downed a SR-71 over Siberia, and its crew members were captured",
      " Advanced space surveillance capabilities permitted the SR-71 to be finally retired in 1998 while its successor was developed",
      " The publicly revealed U2, D-21, SR-71 and their assigned missions were all once shielded from the public during development and execution",
      "A neutral observer might observe that the US precedent for violations of competitor airspace sovereignty may not place it on solid ground in criticizing other countries today",
      "As for the military employment of high altitude balloons the US was also a pioneer",
      " Public sources document that years before China detonated its first nuclear weapon the US was suspending nuclear weapons beneath high altitude balloons in tests and lofting them to 80,000+ feet before detonation",
      "Fortune Magazine recently reported the US Army intends to field high-altitude balloons for surveillance missions",
      " Public sources show the Pentagon has programmed $27 million in fiscal year 2023 for balloon-related projects aimed at operationalizing stratospheric platforms for a variety of military purposes",
      " The US would be the first to admit that great powers require both world class science and intelligence programs to protect their interests",
      " It would also agree that these alone should not lead to conflict",
      " We should not demonize competitors from employing technology sensibly for science or in defense of their national security priorities",
      "Unfortunately, the US' misleading practice of \"do as I say, and not as I do\" is the very definition of the type of hypocrisy that could lead to war if the public is not fully informed",

      "China and Australia should implement the important consensus reached at the Bali summit, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, and cherish the positive momentum of stabilizing and improving bilateral relations",
      " The important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022 was the first formal meeting between the leaders of the two countries in six years",
      "The two countries have restarted or resumed institutional dialogue and consultation on diplomacy, economy and trade, and should continue to promote dialogue and exchanges at all levels",
      " The two sides should view and properly handle differences and address each other's legitimate concerns, Qin said",
      "We hope that the Australian side will provide a fair, impartial and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises to invest and develop in Australia, Qin noted",
      "Wong wished the upcoming two sessions, China's key political events, a full success and said that sound Australia-China relations are in the common interests of both sides",
      "Wong reiterated that she would stick to managing the differences between the two countries",
      " Australia will jointly implement the outcomes of the new round of Australia-China diplomatic and strategic dialogue and fully supports the resumption of more institutional dialogues between the two countries",
      "Australia-China economic, trade and investment cooperation is mutually beneficial and Australia welcomes Chinese investment in Australia and will treat Chinese companies on an equal footing, Wong said",
      "The economic and trade relations between China and Australia are the ballast stone and booster of bilateral ties",
      " As trade has been steadily on the rise, it is predictable that China-Australia relations will be restored and even strengthened, Chen Hong, president of the Chinese Association of Australian Studies and director of the Australian Studies Centre at East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "Data showed that China-Australia trade has been carried out normally, disclosing that in 2022, bilateral trade in goods exceeded $220 billion, bringing tangible benefits to the businesses and people of the two countries",
      "Political wisdom of Canberra is needed to manage such differences between the two countries so as to boost bilateral ties, said Chen, noting this can help Australia's economic recovery after the pandemic and other national interests",

      " China has called for a ceasefire and a cessation of war from the very beginning, and a political settlement of the crisis through diplomatic negotiations, and will continue to play a constructive role in this regard, Qin said",
      "Chen believes Penny's mention of the Ukraine crisis during the meeting with Qin was a response to the US-led Western camp as the US and its allies including Australia have been trying to bring China into the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      "Instead of joining the US to intensify the regional tensions, Chen called on Australia to play a proactive role with China in the Asia-Pacific region",

      " A \"golden dragon\" cruises along the Yulong River in Yangshuo County, South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Photo: China DailyNumerous Chinese netizens on Sunday demanded an apology from Instagram, a hit social media platform around the globe, for mistakenly labeling a post from the Chinese Foreign Ministry introducing the country's \"golden dragon\" cruises as fake information",
      " \"A 'golden dragon' cruises along the Yulong River in Yangshuo County, South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,\" the official account of China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson's office posted the picture on Saturday, with a caption introducing overseas readers to the wonders of the \"700-meter-long dragon lantern",
      "\" However, the post was labeled as \"false information,\" and said that an independent verification agency had reviewed it",
      " Instagram even provided a link to a news article as evidence that the post released by the Chinese foreign ministry was \"fake",
      "\" This so-called evidence is another ridiculous own goal made by Instagram",
      " The link, from a local Telugu language website, said that in November 2022, a number of accounts from India claimed to have shared a video link showing the river lamp in India's Hyderabad, which was actually the video of Guangxi's dragon lantern cruises posted by China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson's office",
      " According to this Indian website, the video posted by some Indian netizens was actually published by the Chinese media outlet China Daily in September 2022, and the scenes in the video actually took place in China's Guangxi, not India",
      " To put it simply, Instagram took the link to help China clarify the facts as evidence that \"Chinese authorities published false information\" and discredited and smeared China in the name of dealing with rumors",
      " The label \"false information'' is still attached to the post of the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Instagram as of press time, and Instagram has so far failed to offer any explanation or apology even after an inquiry was sent to the platform on Sunday by the Global Times",
      " \"Instagram should offer an explanation and apology for its ludicrous mistake as soon as possible,\" a netizen commented on a Chinese social media",
      " \"I can't think of a more vivid example of the so-called freedom of speech in the West, which is the freedom to suppress and discredit China",

      " Cyber attack Photo:VCGChinese cybersecurity experts have exposed a hacker group, with its core members coming from Europe and North America, which has been launching sustained cyberattacks against China as its primary target, posing a serious threat to the country's cybersecurity and data security, the Global Times learned from a Beijing-based cybersecurity lab on Sunday",
      "In a report the Global Times obtained from Qi An Pangu lab, it revealed the hacking group, named Against The West (ATW), has claimed to have disclosed sensitive information including source code and database of important information systems related to China about more than 70 times since 2021, involving some 300 information systems of more than 100 important government agencies as well as aviation and infrastructure departments",
      "In particular, since 2022, ATW has intensified its momentum and continued to carry out large-scale scanning detection and \"supply chain\" attacks on Chinese networks, the report shows",
      "Through long-term tracking, cybersecurity experts from Qi An Pangu lab found that the active members of ATW are mainly engaged in programming and network engineer-related occupations and they are mainly located in Switzerland, France, Poland, Canada and other countries",
      "This is the second time that the lab revealed the true face of a hacker organization that has been carrying out data theft and network attacks on China, following the exposure of the complete technical details of Equation, an elite hacking group affiliated with the NSA, in February 2022",
      " Equation was found to have been creating an advanced and covert backdoor, which has been used to monitor 45 countries and regions for over a decade",
      "According to the report, the ATW group was established in June 2021 and became active in online forums in October that year",
      " Since its establishment, ATW has expressed a clear anti-China bias",
      " It publicly stated that it would \"publish posts about data leakage in China, North Korea and other countries",
      "\" It also published a special post entitled \"ATW-War against China,\" which explicitly supported \"Taiwan independence,\" advocated \"Hong Kong independence\" and hyped up \"human rights issues\" in China's Xinjiang region",
      "Since October 2021, the organization has been active across overseas social media platforms, displaying a clear pro-US and pro-West slant",
      " ATW has published several statements claiming that the organization's targets are Russia, Belarus, China, Iran and North Korea and it is willing to share files with the US and the EU or hired by their related agencies",
      "According to incomplete statistics, since 2021, ATW has disclosed important information system source code, database and other sensitive information more than 70 times",
      " The organization claimed that the data came from more than 100 Chinese departments, involving government agencies and state-owned enterprises",
      "For example, on January 7, 2022, ATW claimed to sell \"a large amount of government, NGO, institutional and corporate data in China, involving 102 Chinese entities",
      "\"However, experts from the lab found that the so-called source code is the test data or project code files developed by small and medium-sized software development enterprises",
      " Experts also found that, in order to gain attention, ATW tends to distort and exaggerate its attacks",
      "The lab team identified six active members from the ATW, with three of them from France and one from Canada",
      " One of the members Tillie Kottmann, born in Switzerland, was charged by the US Department of Justice in March 2021, but the case was abruptly suspended at the end of March",
      " Since then, China has been one of Kottmann's main targets, according to the lab report",
      "The organization mainly carried out large-scale scanning and attacks against technical vulnerabilities on SonarQube, Gogs, Gitblit and other open-source network systems",
      " They would then steal related source code and data, which can be used to further exploit and penetrate the network information system",
      "\"This is a typical 'supply chain' attack,\" a senior cybersecurity expert from the lab told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "He suggested that software development enterprises should immediately repair software vulnerabilities, strictly control public network access permissions, and make timely modifications to default access passwords, and further improve the security management ability of source code",
      "As for the leakage of the system source code deployed in the user unit, the expert suggested that software development enterprises should strengthen the security audit of the system source code and encrypt and store the source code and data of important information systems",
      "\"Cybersecurity-related government departments and technical teams should strengthen the monitoring of illegal cyberattack activities of the ATW organization, warn the trend of attack, and carry out background tracing and other countermeasures,\" the expert said",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/Global TimesThe US has taken a substantial step in encouraging Japan to rearm itself",
      " Japanese Minister of Defense Yasukazu Hamada said on Tuesday that Japan plans to order Tomahawk cruise missiles in one go from the US within the 2023 fiscal year, rather than the initial plan that will take several years",
      "The Japanese media, citing government sources, said that the Japanese government is considering buying as many as 500 Tomahawk cruise missiles",
      " The munitions, which have a strike range of about 1,600 kilometers and would cover China's coastal areas, will be used to develop counterstrike capabilities until Japan deploys home-developed ones",
      "Japan's enhanced long-range strike capabilities are intended to deter China",
      " Its defense budget plans to reach 2 percent of GDP within five years",
      " This ratio not only breaks through the original 1-percent limit set by its Pacifist Constitution, but also exceeds China's ratio of less than 1",
      "5 percent of its GDP",
      " The US allows Japan to rearm itself and is helping Japan to acquire long-range attack capabilities to turn Japan into a more important pawn against China, while Japan wants to help the US to fight China in a bid to realize the \"normalization\" of its national defense force and achieve large-scale military expansion",
      "Therefore, it is foreseeable that Japan's long-range striking capability will continue to increase, which means that China will not only face the military forces deployed by the US in the Western Pacific in the future, but also Japan, which is constantly expanding its war capabilities",
      " In view of Japan's aggressive attitude on opposing the Chinese mainland's reunification with Taiwan, Japan may play a more active role in the future if a conflict truly occurs in the Taiwan Straits",
      "The reality that China is facing is severe",
      " I think first, China also needs to further accelerate its national defense development and investment",
      " It is imperative that China's military expenditures are increased to account for 2 percent of its GDP",
      " The goal of NATO countries is that the military expenditure of all member countries should reach more than 2 percent of GDP",
      " Last year, the US was 3",
      "4 percent, Russia was about 4 percent, India was about 2",
      "6 percent, and China was 1",
      "4 percent",
      "This ratio obviously is insufficient to support China's response to growing security risks in the long run",
      " The conventional military capabilities of the Chinese mainland must exceed the combined military power that the US, Japan, Australia and Taiwan island can deploy in the Western Pacific in the future",
      "Second, it should be seen that although Japan has purchased 500 Tomahawk cruise missiles, its strategy toward China is generally defensive in nature, and it dares not to go ahead of the US in terms of intervention and involvement in the Taiwan Straits situation",
      " China's military advantage over Japan is systemic, and the gap will only widen",
      " Therefore, we need to remain determined and patient about handling China-Japan relations, and don't need to treat Tokyo now as Beijing's inevitable enemy in the future",
      " It is strategically beneficial for China to try to stabilize its relations with Japan",
      "While the US continues to incite forces neighboring China to increase their hostility toward Beijing, we must build up strategic confidence as a great power",
      " That is, none of the neighboring forces dare to fight China one-on-one",
      " They have their own calculation on being pawns in the US' anti-China strategy: They actually want to use Washington to achieve faster development or expand their own strategic space",
      "This is a very complex geopolitical game, and China needs to become increasingly adept at navigating it",
      " In this way, Beijing can avoid becoming the center of geopolitical shock and prevent the US from doing more with less in containing China",
      "Japan is a strategically highly snobbish country",
      " China is accelerating development to get closer and eventually surpass the US in terms of comprehensive strength",
      " This is the key lever that will ultimately pry Japan's strategic attitude",

      " The prediction of US and European strategists that the Russian economy would collapse under the weight of sanctions and provoke the people to \"fight against the totalitarian regime\" did not materialize",
      "The Russian economy and its management system have turned out to be much stronger than the West believed, and the inoculation of minds of Russian people against neoliberal ideas turned to be effective",

      " The idea to turn the richest territories of the country into a \"bridge\", \"corridor\", \"transit zone\", \"raw material base of Russian exports\" was flawed, outdated and identical to the approaches of European and American colonizers, which they have used for centuries for their own enrichment",
      "Disbelief in oneself, worship of other people's ideas, alien ideology and dubious values seriously impeded Russia's movement into the future, in which the main vector is not a turn to the East, but a return to itself, to its own roots and origins",
      "A new Russia's turn to the East should not be a reorientation of economics and geopolitics only",
      " More important for us is to return to the true essence of Russian civilization",
      " In this essence, the West and the East are represented to the same extent",
      " This is the uniqueness and strength of Russia",
      " Russia's current reluctance to play to the tune of the Western world does not mean abandoning the gains it owes to European civilization, nor its attempt to adapt to the East",

      " Photo:China MilitaryThe defense authority on the island of Taiwan on Tuesday reported the activities of a whopping 18 H-6 bombers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), a record high in terms of PLA bomber sorties in drills around the island in a single day",
      "Such a large bomber group can rain down an unstoppable barrage of more than 100 missiles against land and naval targets at the same time, and the training was a powerful warning against collusion between Taiwan secessionists and external forces, after recent US arms sales and Western official visits, Chinese mainland experts said on Wednesday",
      "Some 29 PLA aircraft and three PLA naval vessels were detected around the island of Taiwan in the 24 hours between Monday and Tuesday, and among them, 18 H-6 bombers entered the island's self-proclaimed southwest air defense identification zone, the defense authority on the island of Taiwan said in a press release",
      "This is the largest number of H-6 sorties in a 24-hour period since the island began releasing daily data on PLA warplane activities in the region in 2020, CNN reported on Tuesday",
      "It is not revealed which variant of the H-6 took part in the flights",
      " Assuming they were of the H-6K type, which is widely commissioned and can carry six missiles each, then 18 H-6Ks can carry 108 missiles, Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert, told the Global Times on Wednesday",
      "There is no defense against such a saturation attack of so many missiles, Song said",
      "They can target either stationary targets on the ground or mobile maritime targets, the expert said",
      "According to media reports, the H-6K can carry munitions including the CJ-20 cruise missile and the YJ-12 anti-ship missile",
      " During the Airshow China 2022 held in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province in November, an H-6K bomber carried a new type of ballistic missile widely believed to be hypersonic",
      "The PLA bombers' exercises came after the US last week approved another arms sale to the island of Taiwan, which includes spare aircraft parts to support the island's fleet of F-16 fighters, C-130 transport planes and other US-supplied weapons systems, and advanced its National Defense Authorization Act through Congress, which includes direct military loans and fast-track weapon sales",
      "Western officials, including those from Australia, the UK and Japan, recently visited the island of Taiwan, following US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative visit to the island in August, which led to a series of large-scale PLA military drills",
      "The bomber drills could serve as a warning and deterrent to such collusion between \"Taiwan independence\" secessionists and external interference forces, analysts said",

      " Illustration: Liu Rui/GTThe so-called \"Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party\" recently cobbled together by the US House of Representatives is set to make its debut on Tuesday evening",
      " Holding the first hearing in prime time is mainly out of practical consideration to facilitate the show",
      " It was revealed that the hearing will focus on \"security and other threats\" related to China",
      " In fact, they have already prepared political \"dirt bombs\" to attack China",
      "Just two days before the hearing, on February 26, the Wall Street Journal reported exclusively that the US Energy Department had concluded that \"the COVID pandemic most likely arose from a laboratory leak",
      "\" The report was fewer than five pages and even the Energy Department itself labeled it as being made with \"low confidence",
      "\" Nevertheless it has once again ignited the pile of dead ashes of US' political manipulation of virus origins tracing",
      " As long as \"China\" is labeled on the package, even if it's trash, it can immediately be \"turned into treasure",
      "\" This is the current political situation in the US",
      "Just after the hype around the \"unidentified flying objects incident\" died down a little bit, Washington has begun slandering China, claiming that Beijing could possibly provide \"lethal weapons\" to Russia",
      " Now, it has brought up the virus origins tracing issue again",
      " The US has almost seamlessly linked its production and supply of anti-China topics",
      " American politicians have become very good at playing such tricks",
      "It's easy to fabricate rumors but it takes lots of time, energy and resources to refute them, not to mention that the US is using state apparatus to create and spread rumors",
      " They simply do not listen to China's fact-based responses and clarifications",
      " After several rounds, the US society's perception of China has been poisoned once again, which has led to the entire country being kidnapped",
      " This has left the US government with less and less room to maneuver in its China policy, leading to a spiral of escalating tensions in US-China relations",
      "In the past two years, the virus origins tracing issue has been used by US politicians as an omnipotent political tool that can be brought up at any time to disgust people due to its unverifiable and difficult to disprove nature",
      " To be frank, \"low confidence\" basically means baseless",
      " It is quite inappropriate that the tracing of the virus origins is carried out by the Energy Department",
      " Its unfounded conclusions have inexplicably attracted a lot of attention, indicating some people have seen the timing to manipulate the issue",
      "The US has arranged many agencies to conduct so-called \"virus origins tracing investigations\" at the same time",
      " Currently, only the FBI and the Energy Department believe that the virus is likely from a laboratory leak in China, while four agencies and a national intelligence group still believe that the virus may have a natural origin",
      " There are also some other agencies which have not yet drawn out conclusions",
      " The fact that the US is using its intelligence agencies to conduct origins tracing is evidence that the issue has been politicized",
      "The US' motive is not pure",
      " Moreover, the US is simply not qualified to carry out the origins tracing alone",
      " The origins tracing of COVID-19 is a serious and complex scientific issue, which should and can only be carried out through global scientific cooperation",
      " China attaches great importance to and actively participates in global traceability scientific cooperation, adhering to the principles of science, openness, and transparency, and has twice invited WHO experts to come to China to carry out traceability cooperation",
      "In January and February 2021, a WHO-China joint expert team that consisted of both international and Chinese authoritative experts conducted a 28-day investigation and research in China, and released a report on global study of origins of the virus, which reached an authoritative, professional, and scientific conclusion that is by no means matched by anything concocted by the US Energy Department and the FBI",
      "The US relies on its loud voice and dominance of discourse power to confuse right and wrong on the international stage, but a lie repeated a thousand times is still a lie",
      " On the issue of origins tracing, it is US' turn to open up its suspicious biological laboratories and invite international authoritative experts to investigate",
      "As we write this editorial, the hearing has not yet started, but we can roughly imagine what kind of scene it will be",
      " From the \"weapons of mass destruction\" in Iraq to the \"White Helmets\" in Syria, they are all produced on the same assembly line",
      " Historical experience tells the world that no matter how many lies Washington spreads and how many humanitarian disasters it causes, its political elites and media may not even blush",
      " Otherwise, how could this shameful political farce be staged one by one? "

      "2 percent, which is slightly higher than the expected growth rate of around 5 percent of GDP, but it is still considered moderate",

      " However, the increase in China's defense budget for 2023 is only 0",

      " Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang speaks at a forum on Tuesday, introducing China-proposed Global Security Initiative Concept Paper",
      " Photo: Chen Qingqing/GTChina released a Global Security Initiative (GSI) Concept Paper on Tuesday, fully elaborating a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept and providing China's wisdom in tackling growing risks and challenges in traditional and non-traditional security areas",
      " Chinese diplomats and experts hailed the release of the document as timely, necessary and targeted, saying that it provides a detailed blueprint in tackling global and regional hotspot issues in an effective way, especially further clarifying China's peace-promoting position on the Ukraine crisis",
      "In a forum held at the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Tuesday morning, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang unveiled the concept paper and told the audience that the document underscores China's responsibilities and determination in safeguarding world peace",
      " \"'What kind of security concept the world needs and how countries achieve common security?' has become a topic of our days,\" Qin said",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward the GSI at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022 held in Hainan Province in April 2022",
      " The concept is now welcomed and supported by more than 80 countries and regions, the Chinese foreign minister said",
      " Ambassadors, diplomats and representatives from 137 countries and international organizations attended the forum on Tuesday",
      " Some diplomats told the Global Times during the event that they welcomed China-proposed security initiative, saying that it would be important to solve disputes through dialogue rather than bloc confrontation or hegemony",
      "During his speech, Qin noted that China's development is impossible without a safe international environment",
      " Similarly, without China's security, there will be no global security",
      "\"President Xi first proposed a new vision for security, which goes beyond traditional security ideas and power politics in the West,\" Xu Bu, president of the China Institute of International Studies and secretary-general of the Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy Studies Center, told the Global Times on Tuesday",
      "It transcends the long-term practice of Western countries of building their own security on the basis of jeopardizing the security of other countries",
      " When times are so turbulent, \"we need a correct vision as guidance,\" Xu said",
      "As the world is approaching the one-year anniversary of the Ukraine crisis this week, the US and some Western countries have been continuing to fan the flames and escalate the tension by sending more weapons to Ukraine, and making political gestures like the surprise visit by US President Joe Biden to Kiev on Monday",
      "\"China is deeply concerned about the escalating conflict and potential for situation to spiral out of control,\" Qin said, commenting on the Ukraine crisis during the forum",
      " China will continue to promote peace talks, provide Chinese wisdom for a comprehensive solution to the Ukraine issue, and work with the international community to promote dialogue and consultation to address the concerns of all parties to seek common security, he said",
      "The Chinese foreign minister urged relevant countries to immediately stop adding fuel to the fire on the matter, stop blaming China and stop provoking the situation by using references like \"Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow",
      "\"Clear blueprintSome Western media outlets, citing experts, claimed that the concept paper \"continued Beijing's ambiguity over the Ukraine crisis,\" suggesting that it appears to be largely a strategic messaging exercise rather than a fully thought-out strategy",
      "\"In fact, we have a very clear position on the Ukraine issue",
      " This document points out some basic ideas on solving the crisis in a much clearer way,\" Fu Cong, head of the Chinese Mission to the EU, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview on Tuesday",
      "China will also put forward a more comprehensive and authoritative position document in the next few days in terms of a political settlement of the Ukraine issue including some basic ideas such as respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty, respecting the UN Charter and resolving disputes through peaceful means, Fu said",
      "\"One country's security cannot be built on the non-security of another country",
      " All the security concerns of relevant countries should be respected",
      "",
      "",
      " those basic ideas have been included in the paper, which should play a leading role in preventing further escalation and in seeking peaceful solutions,\" the Chinese envoy said",
      "The concept paper provides an important path to further implement the GSI over 20 key cooperation areas and six cooperation platforms, which could be actionable measures, Wang Dong, an expert on China-US relations at Peking University, told the Global Times on Tuesday",
      "\"Although Qin did not mention the US by name in the speech, he urged the US not to fuel the conflict, stop interfering in China's internal affairs and stop comparing the Ukraine crisis with the Taiwan question, to which we are firmly opposed to,\" Wang from Peking University said, noting that China's position is always clear as it always stands on the side of peace, de-escalation and advancing peace talks",
      "\"The document was unveiled in order to fully elaborate our position - that is supporting a UN-centered multilateralism when some Western countries keep blaming us for being pro-Russia,\" Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Tuesday",
      "Some Chinese experts believe that China holds the most objective and neutral stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict as it is taking a very fair attitude toward both sides",
      " In contrast, the US - part of the root cause of the conflict - raised doubts over China's position as Washington views it from its own interests and perspective",
      "\"Under the GSI concepts and ideas, when it comes to the Ukraine crisis, the future security of Europe can't exclude Russia,\" Wang said",
      " As now some forces like the US hope to bring down Russia and exclude the country from Europe in security and energy, that is unrealistic, Wang Yiwei noted",
      "New type of foreign relationsDuring the forum, the Chinese Foreign Minister emphasized that security is the right of all countries in the world, which is not held exclusively by some countries nor should it be decided by certain countries",
      " \"We welcome any country who is willing to join the GSI and support world peace and development,\" Qin said",
      "The document highlights the positive interaction between major countries and the special responsibilities that a major country needs to shoulder in safeguarding global peace",
      " Security and development are complimentary to building a new type of international relations, which is underscored in China-proposed ideas, Chinese experts said",
      "In terms of cooperation mechanisms, the paper supports multilateral platforms, for example, on establishing a new security framework in the Middle East, it supports the League of Arab States and other regional organizations in playing a constructive role, while in resolving regional conflicts, fighting terrorism and safeguarding maritime security, it supports the efforts of African countries, the AU and sub-regional organizations' efforts",
      "\"We are firmly opposed to hegemony and power politics in all forms, the Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation,\" Qin told the forum",
      "Some Western media also highlighted that although the GSI paper mentioned some multilateral mechanisms but it did not mention the organizations like NATO",
      "Against the backdrop of the US-China rivalry, the China-proposed security vision clearly targets US-led bloc confrontation which desires to expand NATO, including into Asian Pacific, that only creates enemies or restructure supply chains in the name of security, creating more confrontation, Wang noted",
      " \"In contrast, China is pushing forward a new type of international relations that are inclusive and balanced, tackling challenges together and achieve the security for all",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/GTHas the global economy survived the winter? Almost everyone hopes to get a positive answer to this question",
      " Given the good momentum of China's economic recovery, the improved growth prospects for regional emerging economies such as Asia, and the rebound in business activities in the US, Eurozone and the UK in February, which were previously predicted to decline by various institutions, it should be concluded that the current global economic situation is better than it was projected a few months ago",
      " However, uncertainty remains concerning whether the global economy can reduce the risk of recession, and embark on the road to recovery",
      " In other words, where it goes still depends on the choices of various actors",
      "Over the past weekend, thousands of protesters took to the streets of Berlin, London, Paris and other major European cities, calling for an end to the war in Ukraine and urging Western governments to stop sending weapons to the battlefield and \"negotiate [with Russia], not escalate",
      "\" A similar scene appeared a few days ago before the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, where protesters demanded that the US stop inciting the Russia-Ukraine conflict, promote talks between the two sides, disband NATO, and reduce military spending",
      " According to the organizers, this may be the largest anti-war protest in the US since the Iraq War",
      "These anti-war demonstrations have coincided with the one-year anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " The deeper background is that many countries in the West haven't gotten rid of inflation risks, but in general they are hovering on the edge of recession, which severely hampers the prospects for the world economy",
      " However, the West's attention on reducing the risk of recession seems to be far less than their enthusiasm for geopolitical confrontation",
      " On Saturday the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors closed in Bengaluru, India",
      " Although India as the host put more emphasis on the threats facing the global economy, the Western media paid little attention to the global economy that G20 is supposed to be concerned about, and instead focused on the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " Since last year, similar reasons have led to the failures of a joint statement at meetings of G20 and other important international cooperation mechanisms",
      "There are many risks facing the global economy today, such as accelerating inflation, energy and food shortage, US Fed interest rate hikes, debt crises, and other specific factors that affect the prospects for the global economy",
      " However, compared with these factors, the biggest threat to the world economy's path to recovery is that some countries insist on using political and so-called \"ideological\" lines to deal with economic and trade issues for their own strategic purposes, which is pushing the world economy toward \"division",
      "\" It is precisely because of this that UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has warned of the risk of world division, and the World Economic Forum has called for \"strengthening cooperation in a divided world",
      "\" Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that once a \"great division\" occurs, global GDP will shrink by 1",
      "5 percent, or more than $1",
      "4 trillion in annual terms",
      " This means prices will rise across the board, and the supply of global public goods will seriously decrease",
      "In this regard, as the country with a GDP that accounts for nearly a quarter of the world's total, the US especially needs to restrain its geopolitical impulses and invest more energy into matters that are beneficial to its own people and the world at large",
      " In fact, not only the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict but also many of the difficulties and uncertainties currently faced by the global economy are related to Washington's extreme selfish foreign policies",
      " For example, the US' Inflation Reduction Act is seen as \"dividing Europe,\" and the CHIPS Alliance Washington is trying to build is shaking the foundation of the global technology industry chain",
      " Furthermore, Washington's narrative of \"democracy VS authoritarianism\" and its camp confrontation have played a destructive role in hindering international cooperation in combating risks",
      "Recently, several international organizations have raised their expectations for the world economy in 2023",
      " This is mainly due to the positive outlook for China and the Asian economy",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/GTAccording to US media reports, US Attorney General Merrick Garland announced on Friday the first transfer of forfeited assets from sanctions against a Russian oligarchduring an appearance with Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin at the US Justice Department",
      " The assets, confiscated from Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev after his indictment on sanctions evasions in April, will go toward aiding Ukraine",
      "US sanctions against Russia are illegal and are unilateral moves unauthorized by the United Nations",
      " Now the US is even transferring the personal assets of Russian individuals to others, which highlights the plundering nature of the US as a robber",
      "The transfer of assets is a high-profile political stunt, which the US government is pretty good at",
      " The $5",
      "4 million assets can be just pocket money for the US - it offers to Ukraine as aid, while Ukraine would use it to buy weapons from the US to feed the US military-industrial complex",
      " This reminds people of how the US dealt with the $7 billion in frozen funds from Afghanistan's central bank",
      " In February 2022, US President Joe Biden signed an executive order allowing approximately half of the $7 billion to be reserved for victims of 9/11 attacks, which means the US keeps the money for its own",
      " This is the very US - robbing money while at the same time appearing to be compassionate for others",
      "On the one hand, the US makes a profit from war",
      " On the other, it aims to achieve its geopolitical goal through war",
      " Recently, the US and some Western countries said they will ship a huge, wide-ranging package of heavy weapons to Ukraine, a move that obviously will intensify the situation",
      " Xu Liang, an associate professor at the School of International Relations of Beijing International Studies University, told the Global Times that the US transferring the assets of a Russian oligarch is extending actions of supporting Ukraine from military aid to the economic sphere, which can be seen as another move to escalate tensions",
      "\"It cannot be ruled out that the US would give confiscated national assets of Russia to the Ukrainian government",
      " The US has viewed Russia as its de facto enemy in the economic sphere, and the US may carry out all possible means to suppress Russia,\" said Xu",
      "Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times that the US' strategy of imposing maximum pressure on Russia has been escalating via salami-slicing tactics, so as to gain more bargaining chips in the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " Cui noted that one of the US' aims is to set a model for Europe",
      "\"If Europe does not follow, it means Europe is not 'politically correct",
      "' Just like after the US said it would deliver M1 Abrams battle tanks to Ukraine, Germany acted 'in close coordination' by deciding to send Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine",
      " Similarly, the US hopes Europe can imitate its transfer of Russian assets,\" said Cui",
      "Cui noted that if under US pressure, Germany and France are propelled to keep a distance with Russia, they would lose their strategic autonomy in the conflict",
      " The European Council president has already urged European capitals to push forward with talks on using $300 billion worth of confiscated Russian central bank assets for the reconstruction of Ukraine",
      "After all, the US only cares about its own interests",
      " In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, US' goal is to weaken or even drag down Russia to strip Russia of the ability to challenge the Western world",
      " By assisting Ukraine, the US has squeezed the negotiation room in the Russia-Ukraine battlefield and prolonged the conflict",
      " Europe has paid a heavy price for the worsening security situation around it, while the US has benefited the most and been on the way of achieving its objective of consolidating the global order led by itself and maintaining its hegemony",
      "Obviously, the US does not want to spend a single penny on the conflict",
      " Xu believes that US' transferring of Russian assets to Ukraine will only backfire in the long term",
      " It shows that the assets in the US of any individuals may be deprived due to international relations",
      " This will consume US' credibility to a large extent, leading to many countries in the non-Western camp to step up efforts to \"de-dollarization,\" and the \"dollar hegemony\" of the US will be dealt a heavy blow and risk facing with an end",

      " Photo:XinhuaChina published a key policy document known as the \"No",
      "1 central document\" for 2023 on Monday evening, in which the world's second largest economy underlined its determination to \"comprehensively push\" rural vitalization with joint efforts of the Communist Party of China and the whole society, as well as speed up achieving rural modernization",
      "The document also introduced nine aspects of work on achieving the goals including securing agricultural supplies/production and strengthening rural infrastructure construction, an extension of last year's missions but also presenting new highlights",
      "According to the document, it is necessary to unremittingly consider solving the \"agriculture, rural areas and farmers\" problems as the top priority of the whole Party's work, and give full play to the efforts of the whole Party and society to comprehensively promote rural vitalization and accelerate modernization of agriculture and rural areas",
      "With the accelerated evolution of global changes of a scale unseen in a century, China's development has entered a period of coexistence of strategic opportunities, risks and challenges, with increasing uncertainties and unpredictable factors, it is extremely important to maintain the bedrock of \"agriculture, rural areas and farmers\" and does not allow for any mistake, the document said",
      "Li Guoxiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that the document's emphasis on the importance of modernizing agriculture and rural areas echoes with the far-reaching development blueprint laid out by the 20th CPC National Congress report, which pointed out that \"the most challenging and arduous tasks we face in building a modern socialist China in all respects remain in our rural areas",
      "\"\"China faces a number of grim challenges in rural revitalization, such as lack of talent and rural aging issues",
      " The No",
      "1 document is a booster of confidence and an institutional guarantee that could mobilize the strength of the Party and the society toward a common goal,\" Li said",
      "Securing food securityAccording to Li, most of the policy priorities listed in this year's No",
      "1 central document are a continuance of last year's, mirroring a high degree of pragmatism and efficiency which will be easier for the localities to facilitate relevant work",
      "This year's document listed nine aspects of key work that China will undertake in 2023 to push rural revitalization",
      " The first mission is securing grain and important agricultural products' supplies and stable production, a reflection of the government's continued emphasis on food security in line with long-term strategy",
      "Specifically, China will guarantee a total of more than 650 billion kilograms of grain output in 2023, Xinhua said",
      "In last year's No",
      "1 central document, China vowed to ensure food security by holding the people's rice bowl firmly in its own hands",
      "According to Li, the importance of stabilizing agricultural production and ensuring supply has been elevated to \"an unprecedented strategic position\" in this year's No",
      "1 document, as well as last year's, amid more unexpected natural disasters",
      "The country's strengthening call for food security also came at a time when geopolitical tensions flared up across the world with military conflicts breaking out between Russia and Ukraine, while US-led protectionism has little signs of abating",
      "In 2022, China produced 687 million tons of grain, up 3",
      "68 million tons compared with the previous year, data revealed by the National Bureau of Statistics showed",
      "Grain security is a bottom line both for economic development and people's livelihoods, which must not go wrong, Hu Qimu, deputy secretary general of digital-real economies integration forum 50, told the Global Times on Monday",
      "It is expected that this notion will be raised repeatedly as one of the priorities of China's development pattern to balance development with security, Hu said",
      "Key missionsIn this year's No",
      "1 central document, the government also stressed a number of missions to push rural vitalization, such as strengthening agricultural infrastructure construction and consolidating support of agricultural science, technology and equipment, something which officials touched on in last year's document but didn't emphasize that strongly",
      "In particular, officials are looking to build an agricultural science and technology innovation system with clear tier, division of labor/cooperation and moderate competition to accelerate breakthroughs in cutting-edge technologies, the document showed",
      "The document also said that China will support the construction of national laboratories, manufacturing innovation centers and other platforms in the field of agriculture, as well as improve the stable support mechanism for basicresearch in agricultural science and technology",
      "According to Hu, China's proportion of primary industry will decline compared with the secondary and tertiary industries, and therefore the agricultural industry must be transformed and upgraded to be more efficient, smart and collective to meet with this trend",
      "Tian Yun, a Beijing-based economist told the Global Times on Monday that China's production expansion needs to rely more on the improvement of scientific and technological content",
      "\"The current population structure or labor force structure of China determines that the agricultural modernization will rely more on mechanical equipment to replace the labor force and fine work supported by information and intelligence to improve the yield and quality of food,\" he noted",
      "Besides, the document said China will keep the bottom line of preventing a large-scale return to impoverishment, accelerate the construction of an agricultural powerhouse, as well as broaden the channels for farmers to increase income",
      "Experts also stressed that China's rural modernization has its own traits instead of blindly following the pattern of Western countries",
      "\"The foundation of the Chinese modernization of agriculture and rural areas is to consolidate and improve the basic rural operation system, develop new rural collective economies and advance reform of the rural land system, and grant farmers more adequate property rights and interests, a divergence from the privatizing ownership of lands in the West,\" Li said",
      "\"China's rural land system ensures the rights of about 300 million farmers being guaranteed, and safeguards the lawful land rights and interests of rural residents who have moved to urban areas, otherwise they may be expelled from the cities and live in slums after losing their lands - a very common thing in the Western model,\" Li noted",

      " They worried that giant Chinese-made cranes operating at American ports could become hidden spying tools for China",
      " This absurd claim, which fits the narrative style of American science fiction movies, is not only baseless but also typical of paranoid thinking",
      " It's unbelievable that the US, as a superpower, could be scared by cranes at ports and imagine them as spying tools",
      "From Huawei to TikTok, from balloons to cranes, American politicians' hysteria over so-called national security is becoming increasingly perverse",
      " Observers suggest that if American politicians are really so afraid of \"Made in China,\" they should take off all their clothes and run naked together",
      " After all, the clothes that many Americans wear, even if not made in China, are made of fabrics provided by China or manufactured with equipment from China",
      "How can US politicians dare to wear clothes made in China when they are afraid of a crane at a distant port? Is the next step, in the minds of these politicians, to spread rumors that Chinese clothes have gene-level surveillance that will threaten national security?It is precisely because of their excellent performance and reliable quality that Chinese products, including giant cranes, are widely used around the world",
      " US government officials and media outlets, in fact, know this well, yet they are deliberately downplaying it to suit their own interests",
      "The intention behind such absurd, pathological and irrational hype is very clear - to hijack domestic and foreign public opinion with the collaboration of media and politicians, thus creating an unfriendly, extreme and confrontational environment toward China",
      " This is to ensure that when US politicians implement tough policies against China, they can sustain long-term support and recognition both domestically and internationally",
      "In fact, the emergence of such remarks also exposes the anxiety of US politicians about the decline of their own national strength",
      "Shen Yi, a professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs of Fudan University, told the Global Times that a country can have legitimate national security concerns and maintain reasonable sensitivity to national security",
      " However, the US today blames all its backwardness and shortcomings on others, thereby failing to reflect on itself but carrying out malicious attacks against others hysterically",

      " This is not just anxiety; it is a kind of persecution delusion, a form of excessive paranoia",
      "Perhaps what the US needs now is some kind of collective calming therapy",
      "Ironically, from Huawei to cranes, Washington has been enjoying the benefits of affordable and quality Chinese manufacturing but has never stopped seizing any opportunity to play the \"China threat card",
      "\" Not only does it hype up security threats from China, it also continuously pressures its allies to stop using Chinese equipment",
      "The US has always been like this: enjoying the benefits while letting others bear the cost or consequences",
      " The situation with the Nord Stream pipelines makes it clear that other countries suffer while Washington benefits",
      " The US' strategy of sacrificing other countries to meet its own needs is a selfish approach",
      " One must remain vigilant and avoid being used or treated as Washington's pawn",
      "In addition, American politicians's unwarranted concerns about Chinese cranes are clearly lacking in actual basis",

      " Photo:AFPThe G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting that concluded in Bengaluru, India on Saturday failed to issue a joint statement, and the foreign ministers of G20 will meet against this backdrop",
      "As the holder of this year's G20 presidency, India has been trying to remain neutral in the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " According to media reports, officials who participated in the meeting revealed that India had been asking not to use the word \"war\" in the joint statement",
      " As more and more international conferences and events are being dominated by the topic of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, many countries feel like they are being forced to take sides",
      " Can the G20 summit under India's presidency break out of the pattern of idle talk?The Narendra Modi administration has invested massive human, material, and financial resources into the summit, aiming to achieve three relatively specific goals: to build consensus among major powers and focus on global challenges, to maintain the continuity of issues discussed during G20 summits, and to showcase the continuity, diversity, and inclusiveness of Indian civilization",
      "Obviously, the Modi administration attaches more importance to the first two goals",
      " Since 2014, it has made becoming a \"major power\" in the world a diplomatic goal of India",
      " The extraordinary achievements it has achieved in various fields have further bolstered its confidence in striving to accomplish such a purpose",
      "Since the first G20 summit was held in 2008 in response to the US financial crisis, each summit has issued a joint statement to show consensus on addressing certain major global issues",
      " The world economy has been facing challenges since the financial crisis in 2008 and COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have aggravated the situation",
      " In this context, the G20 summit should focus more on global topics, such as economic recovery and climate governance",
      "The 2022 G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, was the first in a row of Global South G20 presidencies",
      "",
      " Indonesia took a flexible approach regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict; therefore, a joint declaration could be made at the end",
      "However, to maintain absolute hegemony, certain countries have used their advantages in strength to abuse sanctions and force other countries to take their position on the Russian-Ukrainian conflict",
      " These hegemonic behaviors have created divisions in the world and put enormous pressure on the hosts of the G20 summit",
      "Unlike Indonesia, the host of the 2022 G20 summit, India is a stronger country with a higher international status and greater international influence",
      " It also has closer ties with Russia",
      " As a result, there are higher expectations for this year's G20 summit",
      "New Delhi and Moscow share a high degree of strategic mutual trust and deeper defense cooperation",
      " Before 2022, India imported nearly 70 percent of its weapons from Russia",
      " After the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the two countries' strategic cooperation expanded to the energy sector, with Russia now becoming India's largest oil supplier",
      " It is unlikely that India will give up the above-mentioned strategic cooperation with Russia",
      "Therefore, the upcoming G20 foreign ministers' meeting in March and the G20 summit in September will pressure India significantly due to the bone of contention between India on one side and the US and West on how to deal with Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " As an article by the Australian think tank Lowy Institute raised the question if India's G20 will deliver more than hot air with the geopolitical context in upheaval",
      "Some countries, out of their self-interests, try to turn the G20 economic dialogue mechanism that aims at promoting international economic cooperation and global governance into a security dialogue mechanism",
      " At the same time, these countries also engage in creating coteries within the G20, which has worsened the division of the international community and seriously damaged world peace",
      " They do not even take into the interests of India, whom they are trying to woo",
      "China has always advocated and practiced the principle of \"seeking common ground while shelving differences,\" while promoting the building of a human community with a shared future",
      " Obviously, China's global initiatives and spirit of cooperation are more in line with the G20 objectives and have more in common with India in terms of international cooperation",
      " New Delhi can take this year's G20 summit as an opportunity to strengthen dialogue and cooperation with Beijing in the post-COVID era and jointly promote cooperation and development of the international community",

      " Although China and European countries do not share the same position on the issue, Chinese officials and experts believe that the two sides can find common ground to enhance communication and coordination with the aim of advancing peace talks",
      "At the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko will pay a state visit to China from February 28 to March 2, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced on Saturday",
      "Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday he would visit China in early April and called on Beijing to \"help us pressure Russia\" to end the war in Ukraine, AFP said",
      "Although the nature of the two visits will not be the same, the Russia-Ukraine conflict will be a major focus",
      "\"Belarus is an ally of Russia, and it could increase its involvement in the conflict",
      " Given its geopolitical status and location, China can learn what role Belarus could play in helping advance the peace talks,\" Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "A day before Lukashenko's visit was announced, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang talked with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Aleinik on the phone, saying that China is willing to implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state and deepen political mutual trust",
      "On the Ukraine crisis, Qin introduced China's 12-point position paper, China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis, which emphasizes that China always stands on the side of peace and urges the resumption of negotiations as soon as possible while avoiding further escalation",
      " Aleinik said Belarus completely agrees and supports China's position paper, noting that China's relevant proposals have great significance to resolving the crisis",
      "\"To resolve the Ukraine crisis, we can't simply exert pressure on Russia or Putin like the West wants",
      " We need to find out if China and Belarus can find some common ground and jointly play a certain role, which will be a major focus of this visit,\" Cui said",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel may visit China in the first half of 2023 with preparations already underway, Chinese Ambassador to the EU Fu Cong told the Global Times in an exclusive interview",
      " \"China and the EU are expected to usher in frequent high-level mutual visits soon,\" he said",
      "This positive trend of growing high-level exchanges between China and Europe shows that Europe does not want to see a protracted Russia-Ukraine conflict, as the bloc's economy and competitiveness have been weakened by it, Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "\"Europe is gradually walking out of some irrational sentiment toward China, as they slowly understand China's position and raise more suspicions toward the US, especially following the Nord Stream sabotage,\" Wang said",
      "Macron, questioned about whether he will ask Beijing to help pressure Russia, was quoted as saying in media reports that the move aims to ensure Kremlin never uses chemical or nuclear weapons - the main points mentioned in China's position paper - and to \"stop this aggression prior to negotiations",
      "\"\"There are certainly great differences in China's and Europe's positions on the Ukraine crisis, mainly due to a different understanding of the nature of the conflict,\" Cui said",
      " As many European countries are also NATO members, they would not accept that the conflict was due to the NATO's eastward expansion, the expert said",
      "However, Chinese officials and experts believe that the existing divergences should not hinder China and Europe to work together and find a practical solution",
      "\"China values France's advocacy for Europe being strategically independent, and France has a relatively independent foreign policy tradition",
      " To avoid a bloc-driven confrontation, it's important to advance multipolar development,\" Cui said",
      "On the Ukraine crisis, France hopes to seek a balanced solution, which is, however, not allowed in the West",
      " But it does not mean that China and France could not enhance the coordination to find a balanced and sustainable way for ending the crisis, the expert noted",
      " \"If this solution is brought up by China and France, or China and Europe together, it's more likely to be accepted by relevant parties,\" Cui said",

      " Xi said Chinese modernization is a new model for human advancement, and it dispels the myth that \"modernization is equal to Westernization",
      "\" What're the differences between Chinese modernization and Westernization? What inspirations can other countries learn from Chinese modernization? Global Times (GT) reporter Yu Jincui interviewed Giancarlo Elia Valori (Valori), an Italian expert on international affairs, over these issues",
      " This is the second piece of the series on Chinese modernization",
      "GT: There has long been a myth that \"modernization is equal to Westernization",
      "\" How do you respond to this view?Valori: I would like to point out the essential difference, i",
      "e",
      " the erroneous meaning of modernization in the West",
      " Here in the West, modernization - or more correctly \"Westernization\" as you better put it - only means the exaltation of technocracy, markets and trade in the liberal-bourgeois meaning of the term, and the annulment of the concept of independent politics",
      " This presupposes the attempt to annul every metaphysical value that is linked to political, religious, national and humanitarian ideals: in other words, considering man, or the event, only in function of profit, money, the gain of a few on a mass that is desired to be amorphous, deprived of feelings and homologated to the capitalist system of production",
      "GT: How do you interpret the essence of Chinese modernization?Valori: Chinese modernization is not a vision that the People's Republic of China wants to impose on other countries, as is the case with the attempts at Westernization which they attempt to impose on the world at all costs",
      "Seeking satisfaction for the Chinese people and the rejuvenation of the nation is the basic mission of Chinese modernization",
      " The establishment of the People's Republic of China has created the basic social conditions for the modernization of the country, and this is certainly not a recent topic",
      "In the current reform period, the social productive forces are being freed and developed to make great strides in national construction and provide a system guarantee full of new vitality and material conditions for fast development",
      " The era of socialism with Chinese characteristics provides a more comprehensive institutional guarantee, a more solid material basis and a more proactive spiritual force toward national modernization",
      "It combines the fundamental principles of Marxism with Chinese characteristics typical of the specific reality of China and its traditional culture",
      " The drive for modernization, the deepening of its theoretical understanding, the continuing strategic maturation and enrichment of practice, have been advanced in a series of ideas, new insights and forward-looking conclusions, which enrich and develop modernization theories",
      " It is a new analysis of the theories that have promoted the country's historic achievements and changes for years",
      "China aims to basically achieve socialist modernization by 2035",
      " It strives to basically realize the new type of industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, establishing a modernized economic system",
      " Contrary to what is hyped by some Western propaganda, there is no single modernization model in the world, nor is there a standard universal model with instruction manuals",
      "GT: Chinese modernization is the modernization of a huge population, of common prosperity for all, of material and cultural-ethical advancement, of harmony between humanity and nature, and of peaceful development",
      " What inspirations can Chinese modernization offer to other countries?Valori: The analysis of Chinese modernization theory is essentially the treatment of a country with a huge population, based on a profound synthesis of the experience and lessons of the practice and the mistakes of modernizations in other countries of the world",
      "Firstly, China's population is over 1",
      "4 billion",
      " The difficulty and complexities this poses are unprecedented, and the development path and promotion method must also have their own characteristics",
      "Secondly, common prosperity is the prerequisite, and it is also a long-term historical process",
      " Chinese modernization adheres to the rationale of people-centred and not market-centred development",
      " It consciously and proactively resolves regional disparities, urban-rural differences and disparities in income distribution",
      " It promotes social equity and justice, gradually achieves common prosperity for all people, and resolutely prevents polarization",
      "Thirdly, material and spiritual prosperity is the basic requirement of modernization",
      " Material poverty is not socialism - if anything, it is a prerequisite for capitalism - and spiritual poverty is not socialism, while Westernization sees it as superfluous or at best a trend for the wealthy classes",
      " Chinese modernization adheres to fundamental values and strengthens the education of ideals and beliefs",
      " It promotes traditional Chinese culture, enhances the spiritual power of people, and promotes the complete enrichment of people who use things and are not used by them",
      "Fourthly, Chinese modernization must not only create more material wealth and spiritual wealth to meet people's growing needs for a better life, but also provide high quality ecological products to meet people's growing needs and the healthiness of their environments",
      " It therefore focuses on promoting the construction of material civilization and of ecological civilization at the same time",
      "Fifthly, modernization emphasises the mutual benefits in building a global community of shared future and strives to contribute to human peace and development",
      "As seen above, in the past and still today, some countries have taken the path of violently plundering their colonies and of modernizing their societies at the expense of others' backwardness, whereas Chinese modernization emphasises mutual benefit and win-win outcomes",
      "Unlike other modernizations, Chinese modernization does not seek to impose itself on the world through violence, but seeks to improve its own country",
      " History will tell us whether it will then be taken as an example by other peoples and countries",
      "GT: What kind of role do you think the Communist Party of China has played in the process of Chinese modernization?Valori: A profound understanding of the fundamental principles that must be firmly grasped in order to advance and achieve Chinese modernization, i",

      " upholding and strengthening the Party's overall leadership; following the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and a people-centered philosophy of development; remaining committed to deepening reform and opening up, as well as carrying forward the fighting spirit",
      " These core principles emphasize political guarantees, people's viewpoint and values, the fundamental path, the institutional guarantee and the spiritual requirements for achieving Chinese modernization",
      " They are an important part of the theory of Chinese modernization and have important theoretical and practical significance",
      " Chinese modernization is a great feat which is unprecedented in history: Only by supporting and strengthening the overall leadership of the Communist Party of China can Chinese modernization be pursued",
      " Socialism with Chinese characteristics is the fundamental achievement of the Party and the people after untold hardship and at great cost",
      " It is the right path to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation",
      " Only by adhering to socialism with Chinese characteristics can China develop",
      " Chinese modernization is the socialist modernization built by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China",
      "Reform and opening-up is an important tool for the Party and the people to take giant steps to catch up with the times",
      " It is the only way to sustain and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics",
      " China must adhere to the fundamental principle of deepening reform and opening-up, supporting and improving the basic socialist economic system and building a high-level socialist market economic system",
      " It must improve the distribution system, further stimulate the enthusiasm and creativity of all aspects of society, promote the high-level opening-up to the outside world, improve the linking effect of the two resources in domestic and international markets, create new advantages in international competition, and provide strong momentum for the advancement and realization of Chinese modernization",
      " At present, major changes in the world never seen in a century are accelerating and the world has entered a new period of turmoil and change",
      " China's reform, development and stability are facing many profound contradictions",
      " With determination and confidence, China will do its best to overcome all kinds of difficulties and challenges on the way forward and rely on a tenacious struggle to open up a new world for the development of Chinese modernization",
      "GT: Does Chinese modernization represent the future while the old Westernization represents the past?Valori: The old Westernisation does not represent the past, but is a current expression of tragic eras characterized by two world wars waged by imperialism, and huge tragedies, such as the Holocaust, the nuclear bombs on Japan, and the extermination of entire peoples of the Western hemisphere, to name but three emblematic examples",

      " You just realize all your business transactions can be made via mobile phone, which is very convenient",
      " China has gone ahead of that in terms of technology, and this was even reflected over the last three years when China has adopted very innovative ways to protect people in the country from the pandemic and to maintain exchanges via various virtual platforms,\" Choo told the Global Times",
      "She also thumbed up China's efforts made in maintaining biodiversity in recent years",
      " She has visited more than 20 cities in China and likes Yunnan the most because it is similar to Guyana in its climate, flora, and fauna",
      "Scenery of Guyana Photo: VCGPeople-oriented philosophy a cornerstoneChoo said that the Chinese government derives its own governance system and complimentary economic policies, which have worked for the Chinese people, from China's own unique situation",
      "China has been very innovative and wise in creating its governance and economic systems, which have been responsible for the fast-tracked economic growth experienced by China, according to the ambassador",
      "In just 40 years, China has achieved remarkable economic development that took other countries more than 100 years to achieve, Choo stressed",
      "\"And so there are a lot of lessons to be learned",
      " What the Chinese government has done over the years is that it has formalized and implemented systems and policies in keeping with the needs of the people and the development of its country",
      " The Chinese government has consistently updated, reviewed, and tried to perfect some of the policy decisions and actually make them work for the people of China,\" said the ambassador",
      "Cooperation benefits friends far awayChoo highlighted the greatest achievements of the China-Guyana friendship, including people-to-people exchanges and engagements, which have led to mutual understanding and respect, and have served as a strong foundation for the expansion and strengthening of bilateral relations",
      "She was also impressed by how China's increasing investments in recent years have contributed to growth in trade, employment, and socio-economic development in Guyana",
      " They have also supported Guyana's trajectory on fast-track economic growth with unprecedented double-digit growth rates in the last three years against the backdrop of a global pandemic",
      "As of June 30, 2022, the China Harbour and Engineering Corporation (CHEC) had completed all major works at the Cheddi Jagan International Airport (CJIA), where an expansion project had been underway for almost a decade",
      "The envoy said the project upgrades Guyana's international airport, a major transport hub, which further propels local economic boom",
      "Moreover, with preferential loan funds provided by the Chinese government, the renovation of the East Coast Demerara Road was completed in 2020 through joint efforts by both countries",
      "The road's renovation was the culmination of Guyanese people's hopes of seeing traffic congestion ease between the eastern coast and the capital",
      "Choo said Guyanese people have largely benefited from such projects under the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI)",
      " She expects more cooperation between the two countries outside the traditional sectors such as in agriculture which is a major pillar of local economic activity",
      "Over the last three years, although the epidemic had pressed the \"pause button\" on people exchanges, China-Guyana medical and health cooperation has never ceased",
      "The ambassador appreciated that China extended a helping hand to the developing world and provided much need access and support through the provision of vaccines and personal protective equipment",
      "The anti-epidemic cooperation is a microcosm of the symbiotic relationship between medicine and health, and this bond has been maintained for decades",
      " Since 1993, Guyana has consistently received a Chinese medical brigade which has contributed significantly to the improvement of public healthcare in the country",
      "\"This year, we will celebrate the 30th anniversary of receiving the first Chinese medical team in Guyana",
      " Over the last three decades, our doctors in healthcare sector have been able to work side by side with Chinese doctors to improve their skills,\" Choo said in delight",
      "\"This is a very sterling partnership under the BRI that both of our nations have been able to benefit from,\" Choo added",
      "The ambassador is excited about the opportunities to come with China's reopening of its borders",
      "In a gesture to the reporter with open arms, Choo warmly welcomed Chinese tourists to visit Guyana",
      " She expects more Chinese tourists to visit the Caribbean nation to enjoy the locally made rum and colorful festivals that Guyana is known for",
      "\"As a matter of fact, Guyana has been named the number one Best of Ecotourism destination in the world for the last three years",

      " Although Washington claimed that it is a private drone contracted for marine research purposes, Namibian media generally believed it is an American spy drone",
      " According to the latest data released by the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, a think tank, in January this year, 64 sorties of US military land-based reconnaissance aircraft were spotted over the South China Sea",
      "As a matter of fact, the US is the No",
      "1 country in surveillance and reconnaissance",
      " It has long begun its plan to establish intelligence gathering and reconnaissance networks around the world by using emerging technologies",
      " It is trying to build an absolute comparative advantage in information and intelligence competition in the fields of space, air, maritime and networks",
      " In 2005, the US put forward its National Plan to Achieve Maritime Domain Awareness to gradually expand its domain awareness network to various regions around the world",
      "Since 2010, with the shift of its global strategic focus to the Western Pacific region and the development of unmanned and intelligent technologies, the US has unprecedentedly increased its reconnaissance and monitoring activities in the East China Sea, South China Sea, the Taiwan Straits and waters surrounding China as well as the South Pacific Ocean",
      "Take the South China Sea for example, the reconnaissance operations of the US military have increasingly shown the following distinctive characteristics: First, the frequency of reconnaissance missions are high",
      " Data released by the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative shows that 668 sorties of US reconnaissance aircraft were spotted over the South China Sea in 2022",
      " Second, the US has not only dispatched large reconnaissance aircrafts such as the RC-135, EP-3E, RQ-4, and P-8A, but also deployed oceanographic research vessels, unmanned underwater vehicles, and submarines",
      " Third, the US routinely uses civil aviation aircraft and impersonates other countries' civil aviation codes to carry out intelligence collection",
      " The US military has fraudulently used the civil avionics codes of neighboring countries such as Malaysia and the Philippines to carry out reconnaissance operations against China in the Yellow Sea and the South China Sea",
      " Commercial aircraft such as Lasai Aviation CL-650 and Beechcraft King Air 350ER are also frequently spotted over the South China Sea",
      "The US military's land, sea, air, and space information intelligence reconnaissance has four purposes",
      " One is to detect the activities of submarines and surface ships",
      " The second is to use RC-135 and EP-3 electronic reconnaissance aircraft to detect communication signals and radar signals, thereby deciphering and obtaining important data such as radar deployment, and laying the foundation for electronic interference during wartime",

      " First, the close-range and frequent reconnaissance of the US has undoubtedly increased the frequency of air and sea encounters and the probability of unexpected events",
      " Second, the US military carried out military reconnaissance by fraudulently using the electronic codes of other countries' civil aviation aircraft, leaving a huge security risk for civil aviation",

      " Photo:XinhuaChina's aviation industry has started applying world-leading 3D printing technologies on new-generation warplanes, with 3D printed parts widely used on a newly developed aircraft that made its maiden flight not long ago, said a leading developer",
      "3D printed parts enjoy advantages including high structural strength, light weight, long service life, low cost and fast manufacturing, experts said on Saturday",
      "\"We are applying 3D printing technologies on aircraft on a large scale at an engineering level, and we are in a world-leading position,\" Doctor Li Xiaodan, a member of the Luo Yang Youth Commando at Shenyang Aircraft Company's craft research institute, told China Central Television (CCTV) on Saturday",
      "With the growing demands of new-type warplane development in terms of weight reduction, lifespan extension, cost control and rapid response, previous production approaches reached a ceiling by 2013, and the Luo Yang Youth Commando was established to promote a breakthrough, CCTV reported",
      "The team is named after Luo Yang, head of production of China's J-15 carrier-based fighter jet who died of a heart attack brought on by overworking 10 years ago on November 25, 2012, after observing the country's first-ever aircraft carrier landing tests that featured the jet",
      "The Luo Yang Youth Commando made innovations with no reference and completely mastered the 3D printing technologies, also known as additive manufacturing, and it has been using the latest 3D printing equipment to produce components used by China's new-generation warplanes, CCTV reported",
      "\"3D printed parts were widely used on a newly developed aircraft that has made its maiden flight not long ago,\" CCTV quoted Li as saying",
      "Compared with conventional manufacturing methods, which need to use rivets or welding to connect parts together, 3D printing builds an integrated part, which enjoys a higher structural strength, which also leads to a longer service life, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Saturday",
      "It also enables manufacturers to use no extra materials, which makes the part lighter, Song said",
      " Another advantage is that 3D printing is fast, and parts can be quickly manufactured, which makes logistics support simpler and less costly, he said",
      "The Shenyang Aircraft Company, a subsidiary of the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China, is known as the cradle of Chinese fighters, having built main combat warplanes of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) from the country's first generation J-5 fighter jet to the modern J-15 carrier-based fighter jet and the J-16 multirole fighter jet",
      "It also developed China's second stealth fighter jet, the FC-31, which is available for export, and is also expected to be further developed into China's next generation carrier-based fighter jet, according to analysts",
      "3D printing technologies have now been implemented in major aircraft manufacturing factories of the Chinese aviation industry, making China a country to use such technologies on a large scale, the CCTV report said",
      "This means aircraft manufactured not only by Shenyang Aircraft Company, but also by other Chinese aircraft makers are using 3D printing technologies, observers said",

      " 9, 2021",
      " Photo:XinhuaThe COVID-19 epidemic in China can be considered basically over despite sporadic cases, Liang Wannian, head of China's COVID-19 response experts' team, said at a press conference on Thursday, adding that China has achieved a major victory in the prevention and control of the coronavirus",
      "The \"major victory\" means that the country has weathered the test of the latest round of the epidemic and built up a relatively good immunity barrier among the population",
      " The epidemic has not completely disappeared, as sporadic and localized infections still exist, Liang noted",
      "China has achieved a major and decisive victory in its COVID-19 prevention and control since November 2022, and created a miracle of the most populous country in the history of human civilization successfully walking out of the epidemic",
      "The country's policy adjustment and optimization helped achieve a stable transition and keep the overall death rate at the lowest level worldwide, Chinese top leadership said on February 16",
      "Also on the same day, a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee presided over by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, pointed out that China's epidemic prevention procedure has been extraordinary over the past three years",
      "The country optimized and adjusted epidemic prevention and control measures in accordance with the circumstances, effectively coordinating epidemic prevention and control with economic and social development, said the meeting",
      "The concept of a pandemic is an indicator of the intensity of an infectious disease, the strongest of which is a pandemic, when there is cross-border or continental spread, Liang said",
      "He said that in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 a pandemic",
      " The disease was declared a public health emergency of international concern at the end of January 2021 and remains so to this day",
      "From a global perspective, the status of the pandemic still exists, and so does the threat of the disease, the expert explained, adding that China's COVID-19 prevention and control achieved a major victory that made it a model for dealing with the pandemic",
      "Explaining whether the country is out of the pandemic, Liang said the judgment depends on a number of indicators, including the infection rate, the level of immunity of the population, the mutation of the pathogen and the reception capability of medical institutions",
      "The last indicator is the overall prevention and control capacity of the epidemic, that is, whether the means and ability to control the disease are basically in place",
      "The country's optimized COVID-19 management since November 2022 has realized a smooth transition of the anti-epidemic work, with more than 200 million people receiving treatment, 800,000 severe cases being effectively treated, and the death rate remaining at the lowest level in the world",
      "Information released by the China CDC on February 15 said that the number of in-hospital deaths dropped to nine on February 13, decreasing 99",
      "8 percent from the peak",
      " Starting on December 9, 2022, the number of reported positive cases increased and then kept declining",
      " It reached a peak of 6",
      "94 million on December 22 and dropped to 8,847 on February 13",
      "Chinese health officials and experts said recently that the nationwide COVID-19 situation has generally become stable",
      " Although a new wave of mass infections is unlikely to occur in the coming months, schools and rural areas will be the next priority for epidemic control",
      "Moreover, seven cases of XBB",
      "1",
      "5 have been reported in China since the implementation of the class B COVID management on January 8",
      " Although the neutralizing antibodies retained in the population provide immune protection in the short term and are less likely to cause a new pandemic in the near future, the harm of the virus remains, experts noted",
      "The meeting held by the CPC Central Committee pointed out that although the overall epidemic prevention and control situation has been improving, given that the global pandemic is still ongoing, all places and departments need to summarize their three years of experience and implement epidemic control in the new phase in order to further consolidate the hard-won result",
      "The meeting also called for strengthening capacity building for epidemic monitoring and regular early warnings, improving the epidemic monitoring system and information reporting system, and giving prompt and accurate early warnings while planning the next stage of work in boosting the vaccination rate among the elderly",

      "The Globe and Mail newspaper reported on Tuesday that the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) found Chinese \"monitoring buoys\" in the Arctic last year and were aware of Chinese surveillance attempts that have both commercial and military applications",

      "The Chinese Embassy in Canada also expressed strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to the smearing, noting that relevant practices of the Chinese consular authorities are in line with international law, which are just and unimpeachable",
      "With ulterior motives, some Canadian politicians have pieced together all kinds of false reports and seriously misled the public while poisoning China-Canada relations, the embassy said in a statement",

      "The report was published as the US has been escalating the great power competition across the globe, and its style of seeking hegemony has been transformed from \"benevolent\" to aggressive, forcing more and more countries and regions to take sides, said Chinese observers, warning that attempts by the US to suppress and contain China will only intensify in the near future",
      "Since becoming the world's most powerful country after two world wars and the Cold War, the US has acted more boldly to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and to pursue, maintain and abuse its hegemony, advance subversion and infiltration, and willfully wage wars, bringing harm to the international community, said the report",
      "The report pointed out that the US has developed a hegemonic playbook to stage \"color revolutions,\" instigate regional disputes, and even directly launch wars under the guise of promoting democracy, freedom and human rights",
      " Clinging to the Cold War mentality, the US has ramped up bloc politics and stoked conflict and confrontation",
      "It has overstretched the concept of national security, abused export controls and forced unilateral sanctions upon others",
      " It has taken a selective approach to international laws and rules, utilizing or discarding them as it sees fit, and has sought to impose rules that serve its own interests in the name of upholding a \"rules-based international order",
      "\"The report listed instances of US interference in other countries' internal affairs",
      " For example, in the name of \"promoting democracy,\" the country practiced a \"Neo-Monroe Doctrine\" in Latin America, instigated \"color revolutions\" in Eurasia, and orchestrated the \"Arab spring\" in West Asia and North Africa, bringing chaos and disaster to many countries",

      " Legislator Nixie Lam, of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong SAR, told the Global Times on Monday that in the past, the US extended its hand to China's Hong Kong many times",
      "Citing the List of Facts of the US Interfering in Hong Kong Affairs and Supporting Anti-China Chaos in Hong Kong, published by the Chinese Foreign Ministry in September 2021, Lam said China has warned US politicians and their agents who meddle in Hong Kong affairs that the Chinese government and people are determined to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and that any outside intervention is doomed to be futile",
      "Also, the report criticized that the country hosted the first \"Summit for Democracy\" in December 2021, which drew criticism and opposition from many countries for making a mockery of the spirit of democracy and dividing the world",
      "In March 2023, it will host another \"Summit for Democracy,\" which remains unwelcome and will again find no support, said the report",

      " Such eavesdropping on allies and partners has already caused worldwide outrage",
      "However, the US has always smeared other countries through spreading fictitious rumors over \"surveillance incidents",
      "\"For example, the US House of Representatives voted to pass a resolution condemning \"China's use of the suspected surveillance balloon\" that was shot down by US jets recently, CNN reported on February 9",
      " China has stated that the Chinese civilian unmanned airship straying into US airspace was completely accidental due to force majeure, and it did not pose any threat to US personnel or safety",
      "According to the Chinese report, the US has fabricated excuses to clamp down on China's high-tech enterprises with global competitiveness, and has put more than 1,000 Chinese enterprises on sanction lists",
      "The country has imposed controls on biotechnology, artificial intelligence and other high-end technologies, reinforced export restrictions, tightened investment screening, suppressed Chinese social media apps such as TikTok and WeChat, and lobbied the Netherlands and Japan to restrict exports of chips and related equipment or technology to China, the report said",
      "Sun believes that the stranglehold by the US on China in the field of science and technology is the most obvious and fiercest, as China's catch-up momentum in the field is very obvious, which has exposed US anxiety over the potential loss of its leading position in the field",

      " Photo: VCGThe Commissioner's Office of China's Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong and the Chinese Embassy in the UK slammed the UK side on Wednesday, saying that playing the card of the British National (Overseas) visa, known as the BN(O) scheme, is a shameful act",
      " They urged the British side to stop interfering in China's internal affairs",
      "Ignoring China's firm opposition and countermeasures, the UK side has been manipulating the BN(O) matter using the excuse of the National Security Law (NSL) for Hong Kong, blatantly violating relevant agreements between China and the UK and providing protection for anti-China rioters, a spokesperson for the office said",
      " This shows hypocrisy and ill-intentioned efforts to use Hong Kong to contain the Chinese mainland",
      "The latest remarks were made after the UK Home Office said in an official video on Tuesday that \"the UK is proud to have welcomed 144,500 people from Hong Kong since our BN(O) visa launch two years ago",
      "\"The Chinese Embassy in the UK also strongly condemned the latest remarks from the British side, saying that the remarks seriously interfere in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs, trampling on the basic norms of international relations, according to a statement released on Wednesday",
      "The British side insisted on implementing the so-called BN(O) visa scheme under the pretext of the NSL for Hong Kong, seriously violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration and relevant agreements between the two sides, the embassy said",
      "China has officially withdrawn its recognition of BN(O) visas as a valid travel and ID document starting from January 31, 2021, as the UK began accepting applications from BN(O)-eligible Hong Kong residents starting on the same day",
      "All the facts have proved that by playing the BN(O) card, the UK is trying to use more Hong Kong people for its political purposes, which shifts the focus from domestic problems, the spokesperson said on Wednesday",
      " Some media reports said that after some Hong Kong residents moved to the UK, they have had a difficult life",
      " There have even been some reports of suicide",
      "The so-called right to \"enjoy life\" is just false rhetoric by the British side, and its hypocrisy is widely known, the spokesperson said",
      " \"The BN(O) scheme is doomed to be another unsustainable performance of hypocrisy",
      "\"The tragic death of a 27-year-old Hong Kong master's graduate, which was suicide according to a coroner's ruling, shows the difficulties of moving to live in the UK, Hong Kong media outlet The Standard reported on Friday",
      "Fion Ho Yee-king's death came after seven months of hardship, and this is just the tip of the iceberg, a migrant in London was quoted as saying in the report",
      "The applicants leave Hong Kong for various reasons, such as career advancement, family reunion and settlement, further studies and retirement",
      " Of course, some are also those who participated in and supported the anti-government protests in Hong Kong, Chu Ka Krin, a veteran current affairs commentator based in Hong Kong, told the Global Times on Wednesday",
      "\"The applicants may still maintain close ties and proximity with Hong Kong, and it does not mean those who leave Hong Kong are abandoning it or that they will never return to their homeland",
      " Application for a BN(O) permit does not mean a loss of confidence in Hong Kong,\" Chu said",
      "Staying in the UK and having affection for Hong Kong are not mutually exclusive, he said",
      " The BN(O) is just a tentative grant to stay in UK and it does not mean right of abode or citizenship",
      "The spokesperson for the Commissioner's Office urged the UK side to clearly view the general trend and stop using the BN(O) matter to cover up for anti-China rioters and stop interfering in China's internal affairs",
      "With new ministers and cabinet members appointed in the UK, policies in areas including immigration keep changing and more updates are expected",
      " These affect the immigrants and BN(O) applicants, making their future uncertain, Chu said",

      " A file photo of Wang Guangfa Photo: Courtesy of Wang GuangfaMajor hospitals in China should increase their intensive care unit (ICU) beds to 10 percent of total bed capacity in next five years as well as train more ICU doctors by seeking financial support from the government, Wang Guangfa, a political advisor and renowned respiratory expert suggested",
      "China has summed up successful experiences during its three years of fight against COVID-19 epidemic, which prevented Chinese people from exposing to more dangerous and lethal variants, Wang, a doctor from Peking University First Hospital, who is also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "However, shortcomings were also exposed during the process, such as the lack of ICU beds, said Wang",
      " He said before the COVID-19 cases surged at the end of last year, there were only four ICU beds per 100,000 people on national average level, accounting for 4 percent of total bed capacity; and the number increased to 8 percent during the COVID-19 peakThe total number of ICU beds for critically ill patients in China is seriously inadequate when compared with developed countries, such as 30 ICU beds for 100,000 people in the US and Germany, said Wang",
      "Besides, Wang said the construction standards of a hospital are still too low, and some hospitals were even equipped with inferior infrastructure",
      " The insufficient supply of oxygen and electricity posed a major challenge for the transferring of ICU beds during the infection peak last year",
      "There are certain hospitals, due to lack of capital investment, which failed to retain their workforce, who chose to quit when emergencies such as COVID-19 spike, said Wang",
      " He pointed out the hospital departments of treating infectious, respiratory and severe diseases are understaffed, and still too small relative to population size",
      "He cited the report of 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which calls for strengthening health management for major chronic\u2002diseases and enhanceing\u2002the capacity for disease prevention and treatment as well as health management at the community level",
      "In order to address those shortcomings, Wang called for government and health authorities to help nationwide tertiary hospitals (which have the largest number of beds and provide comprehensive medical services) increase their ICU beds to 10 percent of total capacity; and then improve the infrastructure, such as oxygen and electricity supplies, so that the 10-20 percent of hospital beds can be converted to ICU beds to cope with public health incidents if necessary",
      "Wang also proposed more government funds to improve conditions and expand hospital department of treating infectious, respiratory and severe diseases",
      " Moreover, hospitals should encourage young doctors to gain experiences in ICU wards",
      "During a government work report delivered by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at the opening meeting of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) on Sunday morning, Li said that more scientific, precise and sufficient virus prevention efforts are needed, as China has started managing COVID-19 with measures designed for combating Class B infectious diseases",
      " The key point is to protect elderly, children and people with underlying diseases",
      " China will push forward vaccine updating, development of new COVID-19 drugs to guarantee the supply of medicines, and protect public health",
      "According to a draft budget report submitted to deputies of NPC, the central government is going to extend fund guarantee for COVID-19 patients",

      " Several US military spy aircraft operate in the East China Sea and the Philippine Sea on August 9, 2022 amid PLA's large-scale exercises around the island of Taiwan",
      " Photo: Courtesy of MizarVisionHigh altitude balloons are widely used for weather surveillance by countries around the world, but the US recently created a series of \"spying\" dramas hyping China's unmanned airship that went out of control, which not only built up tensions, but also seriously harmed China's rights through the use of force",
      " An exclusive report obtained by the Global Times on Monday shows that the US military frequently conducted close-in reconnaissance on China, including the use of balloons, making the US the top spying country in the world",
      "In 2022, the US military carried out close-in reconnaissance operations in the South China Sea over 600 times using spy planes, MizarVision, a Chinese technology and intelligence company, told the Global Times, citing open source Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data",
      "The real figure could be higher, as some US aircraft turn off their ADS-B trackers or use fake ones, MizarVision said",
      "Similar close-in reconnaissance sorties also took place in the East China Sea, including in August, when the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted large-scale exercises around the island of Taiwan, according to the company's monitoring",
      "Frequently deployed aircraft include the EP-3E electronic signals reconnaissance plane, the P-8A maritime patrol and reconnaissance plane, the RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft, the E-8C airborne command and control plane and the U-2 high altitude reconnaissance plane, said the intelligence company",
      "The US military also uses other types of aircraft as well as vessels, and also disguises them as civilian airliners and commercial ships through fake identification codes and by customizing commercial aircraft into spy planes, MizarVision said, adding that such techniques have been used to spy on China's Hainan Island and Xisha Islands in the South China Sea",
      "A suspected spy balloon released from the Philippines is captured on a commercial satellite image near the Philippines on April 2, 2022 during a US-Philippines joint exercise",
      " Photo: Courtesy of MizarVisionThe US military has also used spy balloons, including in an exercise with the Philippines in the Bashi Channel from March to April 2022",
      " Made of polyethylene plastic, the balloon can be used for communications, navigation and remote sensing for more than 45 days at a time, according to MizarVision",
      "But it is a normal practice to use balloons for scientific research purposes",
      "The World Meteorological Organization on Friday said that weather balloons have been a vital part of the global observation network over the past decades, serving as bases for weather forecasts and climate surveillance",
      " Some 1,000 weather balloons carrying radio detectors send data every day",
      "Using high altitude balloons for scientific research activities has become an international norm, with data from the China Science Daily showing that by 2018, the US had released more than 2,000 high altitude balloons, France around 3,000, and Japan more than 800",
      "With technological advances, balloon activities by scientific research organizations and companies around the world are becoming more frequent, which also makes cross-border flights more frequent, including those from the US",
      " When such incidents happen, they are often solved through dialogues",
      "But this time, when China's civilian weather scientific research airship accidentally entered the US, it disregarded facts and China's friendly communication, took the chance for political manipulation and ill-intended hype, and accused China of using the balloon for \"spying\" purposes",
      "A source close to the Chinese military told the Global Times that it is impossible that the Chinese balloon was used for \"high altitude reconnaissance,\" as even Pentagon officials and US experts said satellites would do a better job than a balloon for military reconnaissance",
      "The source said that the current political atmosphere in the US does not respect professionalism and common sense, as it intentionally creates anti-China stunts",
      "The US is conducting so-called analyses on the balloon's payload, and these results could be faked to further throw mud at China, said the source",
      "Zhu Yaochun, deputy secretary-general of the China Air Transport Association, told the Global Times that the US' shooting down of the Chinese airship using a fighter jet and missile was an obvious overreaction and does not conform to international law and norms",
      "In international practice, civilian unmanned aircraft that accidentally enter another country's airspace should be escorted, warned, expelled or forced to land, as resolving a problem peacefully is a key principle of the UN Charter, Zhu said",
      "According to international law, the illegality of an unmanned aircraft entering another country's airspace without authorization can be exempted in the event of force majeure, danger or emergency evasion, Zhu pointed out",
      "By contrast, the US is conducting real military reconnaissance on China using technologies including balloons",
      "The purpose of this kind of close-in reconnaissance is to gather intelligence on the PLA's maritime activities, including those by nuclear-powered submarines, collect electronic information that could decipher the PLA's communications and grasp radar information, learn China's defense facilities by using optical and radar devices, as well as understand the PLA's warplane sortie patterns and reaction times, which serve the US' hegemonic aims, observers said",

      " But for the outside world, the incident is not as simple as it appears",
      "Minihan is a big mouth",

      "\" But he is not that special or rare within the US military",
      " Similar voices have emerged one after another in the past few years, and they are all quite important people in the US military",
      " Navy Admiral Charles Richard, commander of US Strategic Command, said in November at a conference that the Ukraine crisis is \"just the warmup\" and \"the big one is coming,\" referring to a war with China",
      "These intimidating predictions about \"an imminent war between China and the US\" are all similar, while the only difference is the time",

      "\" Apparently none of these predictions is reliable",
      "However, we cannot yet regard these as just ravings",
      " Combined with the actual actions and deployment adjustments of the US military in the Asia-Pacific region, we can see substantive subtexts from these \"babblings",
      "\"The US military may have the intention of stimulating and deterring the Chinese mainland by talking big, but it is indeed making real preparations for a possible military conflict between China and the US, including military intervention in the Taiwan Straits to prevent China's reunification",
      " What Minihan said in his memo is not simply from his gut, it represents the real attitude of some people in the US military",
      " Behind Washington's frequent military deployments in the Asia-Pacific region under the banner of \"peace,\" such belligerent forces are fermenting",
      "Now Washington often talks about establishing \"guardrails\" for China-US relations, but the forces trying to break the \"guardrails\" lie within",
      " Recently, Washington has launched a \"war without gunfire",
      "\" According to US media reports, Japan and the Netherlands have reached an agreement with the US to restrict the export of advanced chip manufacturing equipment to China, which \"marks a significant milestone in US efforts to work with allies",
      "\" Some US media believe the two countries are helping the US",
      " Obviously, in this semiconductor war launched by Washington, Japan, the Netherlands and other countries will only suffer the losses",
      " \"Helping America\" is just a decent way of saying \"serving as cannon fodder",
      "\"Some political elites in Washington are now obsessed with the fantasies of \"crushing China,\" and are constantly fabricating threats or intimidating other countries to create momentum for themselves",
      " However, going against the trend of peace and development makes them feel tired",
      " But this didn't prompt them to reflect, but rather made them more anxious, which however pushes the world to be warier of an impulsive Washington",
      " The hawkish statements of senior officials such as Minihan, and Washington building cliques on chip sector resonate with each other",
      " They show that Washington has played a disgraceful and disruptive role in both issues of peace and development, and has essentially become the \"source of chaos\" for the entire world",
      "According to incomplete statistics, from the end of WWII in 1945 to 2001, the world witnessed 248 armed conflicts in 153 regions, of which 201 were launched by the US, accounting for about 81 percent",
      " Even today, Washington still doesn't abandon the old dream of making big fortune through inciting conflicts",
      " But both history and reality have showed that a country finds itself a wrong rival if it regards China as an enemy",

      "GT: Do you hold a positive attitude toward the recovery of China-EU relations in 2023?Fu: Although China-EU relations still face some difficulties, I am very optimistic about the recovery of the relations",
      "First, the two sides share a very solid political foundation for cooperation",
      " President Xi Jinping mentioned many times that China and Europe are two major forces upholding world peace, two big markets promoting shared development, and two great civilizations promoting human progress",
      " Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, Wang Yi also emphasized many times that friendship is the keynote of China-EU relations, and cooperation is the general goal of China-EU relations",
      " He also mentioned in the just concluded Munich Security Conference that how China and Europe make a choice will affect the direction of the world",
      " These all reflect how much we value China-EU relations",
      "From the European side, both the leaders of the EU and the EU member states also attach great importance to EU-China relations",
      " Shortly after the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited Beijing",
      " Charles Michel, the President of the European Council, also visited Beijing in December 2022",
      " Currently, we are actively planning with the European side in Brussels about the visits of European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to China in the first half of 2023 for the China-EU leaders meeting",
      "In addition, some high-level consultation mechanisms such as the vice premier-level ones will soon resume",
      " In the future, high-level visits between China and Europe will be very frequent",
      "Second, from the economic aspect, China and Europe are natural economic partners",
      " When I came to Brussels, I often said to the EU that we are partners, not competitors, let alone so-called systemic rivals",
      " The solid economic foundation of China-EU cooperation also serves as the cornerstone of China-EU relations",
      "China and the EU have many things in common in their diplomatic philosophy",
      " For example, we both advocate multilateralism and enjoy good cooperation in climate change, arms control and non-proliferation efforts",
      "Of course, there are some specific issues between China and Europe that need to be dealt with",
      " This is why diplomats on both sides should do their best to remove obstacles and solve these specific issues",
      " However, the general trend of the positive development of China-EU relations is clear",
      "GT: The EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) is still frozen today due to sanctions, which attracts the public attention",
      " Do you think we could expect a resumption of the CAI this year? What are the key points to restart it?Fu: Against the backdrop of the current global economic downturn, the CAI should be put into practice as soon as possible, which will play a good role in promoting both economies and the global economy",
      " That is why one of the very important tasks since I came to Brussels is to push the EU to ratify this important agreement as soon as possible",
      "We propose that on this issue, we should look forward, not tangle with the past, and lift sanctions simultaneously to make the CAI resume",
      " Currently, the reaction from the EU is mixed",
      " Some believe it's a good idea, while others think that the conditions are premature",
      "I can't guarantee that the CAI could be unfrozen within 2023",
      " But from China's perspective, we sincerely hope to iron out this problem as soon as possible",
      "I also told the European side that if you find China's proposal may not fly, I hope you can propose a solution that you think can solve this problem",
      " We are open to that",
      " As long as the solution is based on equality and mutual benefit, China will consider it",
      "At present, we are communicating with the EU",
      " We have received some positive feedback, but it still needs more efforts from both sides",
      "GT: What are the main difficulties?Fu: The simultaneous lifting of sanctions is the most straightforward solution",
      " But some people in Europe are reluctant to lift sanctions on China due to ideological bias",
      " They have some concerns about China's so-called human rights issues and argue that it will be difficult to lift sanctions against China, unless China improves its human rights condition",
      "However, we told the EU that, first of all, many of your perception on China's so-called human rights issues are based on misunderstanding and prejudice, which is unreasonable in itself",
      " On this basis, you have imposed sanctions on us",
      " We have taken countermeasures out of the perspective of safeguarding national dignity, which is only natural",
      "At the same time, we believe that it is quite normal for China and the EU to disagree on human rights issues",
      " We can calmly discuss and promote the resolution of some specific issues, reduce the differences on human rights issues, or clarify some issues",
      " We are willing to make efforts in these areas",
      " That is also why China and the EU have resumed the human rights dialogue",
      " We hope that these efforts will help to \"unfreeze\" CAI",
      "I often say to the EU that if you have to wait until all the political and human rights differences between China and the EU are resolved before you develop economic and trade relations with China, when will that be? Therefore, we call on the EU to take a more rational attitude",
      " There are other channels to discuss human rights concerns, and there is no need to link them with economic and trade issues",

      " This is very important",
      "Now some people in the EU always say \"EU's one-China policy,\" as if their one-China policy is not the same as our one-China principle, or they have the unilateral right to interpret their one-China principle",
      " But I stressed to them that the commitment of the EU made during the establishment of diplomatic ties actually included a very important principle, that is, the one-China position of the EU must be acceptable by China",
      "Some high-level officials in EU institutions and anti-China lawmakers visiting the island all violated the one-China principle",
      " There are also European (Parliament) members proposing to sign a so-called investment agreement with Taiwan",
      " If this happens, it will obviously be a major challenge of the political foundation of China-EU relations",
      "As to whether these negative developments have shaken the political foundation between China and Europe, my answer is that we must nip them in the bud to prevent them from shaking the political foundation between China and Europe",
      " If the dangerous situation is not contained in the first place, it will evolve",
      " Therefore, we always make it very clear to the EU that this is a \"red line\" for China and you should not touch it",
      " Otherwise, China-EU relations will face serious problems",

      " In every meeting with us, the European side always emphasize that they will not change the one-China principle",
      " Many European officials said the first lesson they took when they became diplomats was the one-China principle, which is now part of their DNA and told us to be assured",
      "However, it is true that some people will continue to blur and hollow out the one-China principle, which is something we need to be vigilant on and make timely representations with the European side",

      " By visiting both Europe and Russia, the message is that China is promoting peace talks",
      "China is very worried about the current situation",
      " The crisis is now clearly escalating, and both sides are preparing for the so-called spring offensive or counterattack, which means more killings",
      "The arrangement of Wang's visit also sent another important message that China-EU relations should not be affected by the Ukraine issue",
      " Due to various factors, the anti-Russian sentiment in Europe is now running high, and a lot of the emotional things are also reflected in their policies, and there are signs of anger at China",
      " I think it's very irrational",
      "As a major country, China has its own independent foreign policy and will not blindly follow the position and policies of others",
      " It is not very rational for China to take an identical position with the EU on the Ukraine issue",
      "It is true that we do not agree fully on some European positions on Ukraine",
      " For example, many top leaders of the European side say that now is not the time to negotiate",
      " Is this a rational approach? We cannot stand completely with the EU, but we do not want the Ukraine issue to affect the development of China-EU relations",

      " Visits to Russia and Ukraine by China and the US have become the focus of much media attention",
      " Are the two visits similar in nature?Fu: [Visits to Russia and Ukraine, respectively] are clearly not preplanned",
      " President Biden's visit to Ukraine was a sudden visit",
      " Until he appeared in Kyiv, the outside world did not know that he was going",
      " But Wang's visit to Russia was announced previously",
      " We should not compare these two visits in terms of timing",
      "Second, the positions of the two sides are also very different",
      " Biden's visit focused on the Ukraine crisis and was intended to support the war to continue",
      " Wang's visit to Russia is not only focused on the Ukraine issue, but also on all aspects of China-Russia relations, and the Ukraine issue is only one of them",
      "On the Ukraine issue, we have also taken a more fair and reasonable position",
      " We will not take sides but promote peace talks",
      " I think this is the main tone of Wang when talking about the Ukraine issue in Russia",
      "Illustration:Liu Rui/GTGT: Do you think there is a possibility of negotiation in terms of resolving the conflict between Russia and Ukraine? In your view or the Chinese government, what is the biggest obstacle to ending the conflict?Fu: Any war ends at the negotiating table",
      " However, I think there is no desire for peace talks among the relevant parties, so I am pessimistic about launching peace talks in the short term",
      " But I believe, after a period of time, they will finally come to the negotiating table",
      "Now the Russia-Ukraine conflict is a war of attrition with many scenes appearing to resemble trench warfare during WWI, which means a large number of frontline soldiers will die and civilians will be displaced",
      " Rather than deciding to negotiate until realising that the war is unwinnable, it would be better to sit down and talk right now, instead of continuing to fight it out on the battlefield",
      "But apparently, some people are fueling the fire",
      " In my opinion, the biggest \"black hand\" behind the scenes is the US, and it is also the biggest beneficiary",
      " As long as the Ukraine conflict continues, it will help the US with its policies of weakening Russia, controlling Europe and containing China",
      " The American arms industry would make a fortune",
      "GT: The US and the West seem to want to drain Russia through the war and push it back to a \"second-rate country",
      "\" In your opinion, if Russia really declines from a great power to a \"second-rate country,\" will it be a disaster or a good thing for the world order?Fu: First of all, there is a big question mark over whether it can defeat Russia",
      " If the West is to defeat Russia, it would be a brutal and protracted war and a great risk to the world, given the fact that Russia is a major nuclear power",
      "I often tell my European colleagues, are you really willing to take such big risk to continue this war? We need to analyze the current situation calmly and realistically, and then adopt appropriate policies",
      "As for wishful thinking to bring Russia back to a \"second-rate country\" or even seek regime change in Russia, I think these are dangerous statements that can only escalate the war",
      " That also completely exclude peace talks and would only cause more damage and killing",
      "GT: Although you are focused on European affairs, we want to ask a question about China-US relations, because the world is really paying close attention to China-US relations",
      " At the Munich Security Conference, Director Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had informal contact",
      " Do you think the China-US relationship can move on through the \"balloon incident\" after informal contact? Or will the \"balloon incident\" continue to have a relatively long-term negative impact on China-US relations?Fu: From China's point of view, it is our policy goal to maintain sound China-US relations",
      " That is indisputable",
      " However, maintaining China-US relations requires the joint efforts of both sides",
      " As we can see, both the sincerity and ability of the US to maintain China-US relations are questionable",
      "The so-called \"balloon incident\" was an accident, which China immediately explained to the US",
      " The US said that China did not communicated with the US, which is itself false information",
      "At the very beginning, the US did not think it was a big deal",
      " If not, why didn't shoot the balloon down before it drifted into its so-called sensitive area, but only after it had flown out of the continental US? This means that it is not very concerned about the so-called detection",
      "But the question is hyped because it fell victim to US partisan rivalry",
      " Under the pressure of such battling, the US has taken an extremely irrational approach to hit balloons with missiles",
      " It's almost like fighting mosquitoes with cannon",
      " It is irrational",
      " If the current US government really attaches great importance to China-US relations, it should take a more rational solution even in the face of some domestic pressure",
      " So, we first doubt its sincerity",
      "Second, we have some doubts about its ability to maintain China-US relations",
      " From the perspective of handling the entire issue, the US not only failed to provide a clearer explanation for irrational speech in the country, but instead fueled the fire, which only made the domestic public opinion field even more anti-China",
      " Therefore, we doubt its sincerity and ability",
      "Whether the \"balloon incident\" can be turned over depends first of all on whether the US will continue to hype this issue",
      " If it realizes its mistakes and stops hyping it, it will have a positive impact on the \"gradual soft landing\" of this issue",
      "GT: Last but not least, we would like to invite you to talk about China's recently released Global Security Initiative Concept Paper",
      " What do you think is its significance?Fu: First of all, I think this is an important document from the Chinese side, and it is a further explanation of the Global Security Initiative proposed by President Xi in April 2022",
      " We can see from this document that it is, above all, the promotion and inheritance of the UN Charter and the basic principles of international law",
      "Second, my feeling is that this is a \"comprehensive body\" of our positions in the field of international security, forming an organic whole and a complete plan of our positions and views on international security put forward on different occasions",
      "Third, the proposal of this document is also a further extension of President Xi's concept of a community with a shared future for mainkind",
      " In fact, it is a further explanation of President Xi's important concept in the field of international security",
      "Fourth, this is closely related to the current situation, which is its outstanding feature",
      " Proposing the concept paper at this time is closely related to the current international security situation we are facing",
      "At present, the changes unseen in a century are accelerating, and the international situation is undergoing profound changes",
      " Many unstable factors are superimposed",
      " The Ukraine crisis in Europe is facing the danger of escalation, and the risk of nuclear proliferation in Northeast Asia is also rising sharply",
      "In some non-traditional security fields, food security and energy security are also becoming increasingly prominent",
      " Hence, we put forward the paper, which comprehensively expounded some of our major propositions in the field of international security, and has very important guiding significance for solving the current international security dilemma",

      " Illustration:Liu Rui/GTAfter China decided to optimize its COVID policies, the US and the European Union offered to share vaccines with China",
      " But as Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said, China has seen rising vaccination rates, strengthened treatment capacity and expanded production capacity of medical supplies,\u2002which are generally adequate",
      " China has established the world's largest COVID vaccine production lines, which are able to ensure that anyone eligible for vaccination has access to COVID vaccines",
      " However, the sudden \"generosity\" of some Western countries, especially the US, has surprised people",
      " Many still clearly remember how the US engaged in political manipulation on many issues of global cooperation in the pandemic fight, including vaccine distribution, in the early stages of the outbreak and during its continuous spread",
      "The US vaccine offer is hypocritical in essence",
      " First, when it comes to vaccine aid, the US doesn't give help when it's most needed",
      " The US has always followed the \"America First\" doctrine in responding to the epidemic, just as it does in fields such as trade and technology",
      " Washington prohibited its firms from exporting medical products to other countries, including traditional European allies, in the early days of the pandemic",
      " It began providing vaccine aid to other countries only after there were signs of vaccine oversupply inside the US",
      " According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 82 million COVID-19 vaccine doses were thrown out in the US between December 2020 and mid-May 2022, due to a variety of reasons, including vaccine vial expiration",
      " This is why people suspect that the main motivation of the US in offering vaccine aid is to clear its inventory and make itself an appearance of a \"good guy\" at the same time",
      "Second, the US often goes back on its word in terms of vaccine donations",
      " US' promises to donate vaccines often risk turning into a bounced check",
      " For other countries, their hopes for US vaccine aid are often met with a US cold shoulder, impeding their efforts to curb the epidemic",
      "Third, there are commercial interests behind the US' vaccine aid",
      " Although the US government initiated a public-private partnership called Operation Warp Speed to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, it is actually a handful of US pharmaceutical giants that produce the vaccines and profit from them",
      "Most of the vaccines in the US are produced by Pfizer and Moderna",
      " More than half of Pfizer's record $100",
      "3 billion in 2022 revenue came from COVID-19 vaccines and Paxlovid, its oral antiviral",
      " Although the two companies have accumulated relevant vaccine technologies for many years, many people still have doubts about their \"standing out\" during the pandemic, believing that there have been profit transfers, political lobbying and even other behind-the-scenes maneuvering",
      " The commercial interests of the two companies are directly linked to US vaccine aid provided to other countries",
      " Pfizer recently said it expects sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and oral treatment to decline significantly this year as the world emerges from the pandemic, causing its stocks to slump",
      " It is believed that US vaccine aid to other countries will help the companies involved to solve this predicament",
      " The involvement of huge commercial interests is the main reason why the outside world is suspicious of the US offer of vaccine aid",
      "For the above-mentioned reasons, the US vaccine aid offer has done nothing to remedy the negative impact its many destructive practices brought about in the early stage of the pandemic",
      " In the face of this sudden and severe challenge to mankind, the US obviously failed to set a good example, and it has done badly in many aspects, including vaccine supply",
      "Judging from the US' actions, Washington hasn't regarded the COVID-19 pandemic as an international public health crisis, nor has it cooperated with other countries in dealing with the pandemic in a responsible manner",
      " Instead, it has played political and diplomatic cards",
      " US vaccine diplomacy is clearly utilitarian",
      " Its primary goal is to expand US soft power, and fighting the epidemic is only a secondary task",
      " As a result, many US actions, including its vaccine diplomacy, have not produced positive effects",
      "The COVID-19 epidemic has become the most expensive public health crisis in the history of the US",
      " If the US had been able to devote more resources and energy to responding to virus mutations and their international spread, some long-term costs could have been avoided",
      " On the issue of vaccines, the most effective \"assistance\" the US could offer is actually to open up and waive related patents, so as to help the global medical community find a way to eradicate this disaster and prevent the next crisis",
      " This approach may cause some American pharmaceutical giants to lose some profits, but it will allow countries around the world, including the US, to emerge from the crisis earlier",

      "Given the lessons from the two world wars, Japan's remilitarization should be a cause for alarm among all countries in the region, they warned",

      "Liu Jiangyong, vice dean of the Institute of Modern International Relations at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Wednesday that deploying a missile defense unit at the Ground Self-Defense Force camp closest to Taiwan island is a specific step from Tokyo to implement their new national security guidelines",
      "Japan on December 16 approved three documents - the National Security Strategy, the National Defense Program Guidelines, and the Mid-Term Defense Program - in one of the country's largest defense shake-ups since World War II",

      "On December 11, policy chief of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Koichi Hagiuda said Japan needs to increase its military spending when meeting with secessionist leader Tsai Ing-wen in Taiwan on December 11",

      "9-square-kilometer island, it is more likely that Japan intends to use the surface-to-air guided missile unit to safeguard its intelligence and monitoring capability",
      "Yonaguni is Japan's closest land to Taiwan island and to key military bases along the Chinese mainland's southeastern coast",
      " Japan has been deploying monitoring stations on Yonaguni to snoop on activities of both the mainland and Taiwan",
      "Therefore, Chinese experts said not only Yonaguni, but also the entire Ryukyu Islands is expected to be at the forefront of Japan's military deterrence against China in the next five years, with the ability to deploy weapons to strike important military installations within enemy territory",
      "This means that in the future, Japan may completely get rid of its post-war pacifist image that was of great importance to its economic development, to become a country that poses a threat to its neighbors, develops its military industry, and is likely to use force abroad, Liu warned",

      "Members of Congress shrieked about the so-called threats to US national security, as if Doomsday was approaching",

      "",
      "",
      " Chinese balloons briefly transited the continental United States at least three times during the prior administration",
      "\" Yet compared with the frank, open and calm manner of the Chinese authorities, the performances of some US politicians in the current Biden administration can be said as hysterical",

      " In December 2022, US President Joe Biden approved a record $858 billion defense spending bill for 2023",
      " The figure not only ranks the first on global scale, but is also more than the military expenditure of the next nine countries combined",
      " Yet the superpower somehow freaks out about a wandering balloon, which exposes it as a paper tiger",
      "From the perspective of modern military technology, balloons have long been logged off from mainstream military toolkits",
      " The use of balloons, especially the type involved in the latest incident, which can be sent to the Earth's stratosphere, is for collecting meteorological information",
      "Yet Politico magazine made a \"serious\" analysis, claiming they are \"cheap, can carry a lot, and can hang out for a long time\" for \"surveillance missions",
      "\" To put it bluntly, this is deliberately pretending to be anxious",
      " If such balloons were as efficient as surveillance equipment, they would have appeared in the Pentagon's purchase list long ago",
      " Anyone who understands this technology knows that US satellite surveillance system, as well as regular close-in reconnaissance toward China, are the ones that can be described as aggressive and amok",
      "Seeing how the incident was hyped up in the US, people can clearly see that US domestic political struggles are compressing the room for Washington to make responsible decisions for crisis management and strategies for stability",
      "In light of the historical development of the strategic games of great powers after World War II, crisis management and strategic stability require effective communication and exchanges among major countries on emergencies based on facts and seeking truth from facts",

      " But how it turned out? Political figures in Washington are jumping up and down, yelling and screaming, seizing the opportunity to show their toughness and firmness, without the decency or grace they are supposed to have, and they have made China-US ties the victim of political infighting among different factions, when they are hitting and biting one another",
      " They are extremely irresponsible",
      "Another manifestation of such irresponsibility is displayed by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's reportedly planned visit to China",
      " It is supposed to be a follow-up of the China-US summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022",
      " But the US side seems to have mistakenly believed that Blinken's Beijing trip is some kind of gift from the US to China, and the US side can make it work if it likes, and can cancel the trip if it doesn't",
      "As Chinese Foreign Ministry points out, \"One of the tasks of the diplomatic teams on both sides is to properly manage bilateral relations, particularly to manage some unexpected situations in a cool-headed and prudent manner",
      " In fact, neither side has ever announced that there would be a visit",
      " It is a matter for the US to make its latest announcement, and we respect that",
      "\"That being said, be it the narrative that Blinken was planning to visit China, or the reports that the trip was postponed, they are all monologues from the US, which are not in line with either diplomatic management or the rules-based laws that the US has been talking a lot, or the consensus reached by the two sides after consultation",
      " The one-man show of the US will do no good to help China-US relations back to the sound track as soon as possible",
      "The wandering balloon episode echoes an old Chinese saying - life can be really simple, but some insist on making it complicated",
      " The reaction from the US is bringing troubles on oneself",

      "   A plume rises over East Palestine, Ohio, as a result of the controlled detonation of a portion of the derailed Norfolk Southern trains, on February 6, 2023",
      " Photo: VCGEditor's Note:The train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio of the US on February 3 that unleashed highly toxic chemicals into the air, water and earth have left local residents fearing for their lives and aggrieved about how the government and the rail company, Norfolk Southern, have handled the aftermath of the accident",
      "In her I-Talk show, Global Times (GT) reporter Wang Wenwen interviewed Candice DeSanzo (DeSanzo), an East Palestine resident who and her kids suffered enormously after the derailment accident",
      " \"What I would want from the Chinese media is don't let us be forgotten, because that is my biggest fear with the media and the US,\" she said",
      "GT: After the accident, how is the water and air different from before? What happened to you and your kids?DeSanzo: We left our house on February 3",
      " We decided to shelter in place when we heard that they were going to do the controlled burn",
      " We left",
      " A few days later, they told us it would be safe to return to our homes",
      " So we came back",
      " And it was fine",
      " The first night we got home, I did notice a strong smell in the air when we got closer to getting into town",
      " I woke up the next morning and I noticed that my 1-year-old-son's voice was really worse",
      " From 24 to 48 hours after that, everybody in my family started having symptoms, including my animals",
      "The first day home, I bathed myself in the water and brushed my teeth with the water, I'm not bathing my children in the water",
      " After I was told the water was safe, I gave them a bath",
      " And they broke out in a horrific rash all over their bodies",
      " I see multiple other residents whose children are getting rashes also",
      " I develop multiple canker sores inside of my mouth",
      " I've never had a canker sore in my entire life",
      "I definitely believe that there's something going on with the water, even though it's testing OK",
      " I don't know if they're failing to test for the chemicals that they should be",
      " I'm not a scientist",
      " All I know is what I'm seeing with my own eyes and feeling in my own body",
      "As far as the air, there are certain times today where the air seems absolutely fine",
      " There's other time of the day where a smell will come through",
      " It is like a burning, plastic, chlorine, sweet type of smell",
      " As soon as I can actually smell that terrible odor, I feel that my symptoms that I'm having and my children's symptoms ramp up by three",
      "And the most ominous thing is that it seems the smell gets awful once the sun goes down",
      " And it makes many of us residents question what they are doing down there at night that is causing that smell to become increasingly more prevalent in the air at night",
      "GT: It was only after many days of the derailment that big US media started to pay attention to it and report on it",
      " Why?DeSanzo: I think that Norfolk Southern had some humbleness in their hearts when they found out that train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio",
      " Because I feel that they view us as a poor town full of stupid people, a town full of hillbillies, which I think they have learned we are definitely not",
      " We are a town full of respected individuals, educated individuals",
      " And we were not going to allow Norfolk Southern to sweep this under the rug",
      " I think that they did everything in their power along with the government to keep this from going mainstream media",
      "I think that's evident by Evan Lambert, the only national correspondent to be here for Governor Mike DeWine's press conference was arrested",
      " I've never heard of something like that in my life either",
      " I honestly believe that it was all of us residents coming together and being EP (East Palestine) strong and uniting as a force to say, \"hey, we need help up here",
      " We're going to put a spotlight on you guys because we already know that you're lying to us",
      " You're not being truthful with your words",
      " And we're going to hold your feet to the fire and make you accountable for what you guys have done",
      "\" I think without a media presence, that doesn't push them hard to do the right thing",
      " It's important that this story isn't just covered in the United States",
      " I believe it's important for this story to be covered nationwide",
      "I want people to see our kids sad, I want people to see me crying, I want people to see me throwing bricks in this water that they say safe and see all the oil come to the top",
      " I want reporters to come here and even though it's terrible, when they leave say, \"hey, I was in East Palestine for two hours and I have a terrible headache,\" because it gives validity, and it backs up what every single person in this town is saying",
      " And it makes us seem more credible, and it keeps the story alive",
      "GT: How long will the pollution of air, water and earth caused by the train derailment last?DeSanzo: Honestly I hate to say this, but I believe that we are going to be dealing with this for generations to come",
      " I think that Norfolk Southern did not do the right thing in the days preceding this train derailment",
      " I believe, by them leaving those toxic materials, hundreds and thousands of gallons of oil to just sink into our soil even further, I think by doing the controlled burn, it was the cheapest solution - maybe not the only one nor the safest and they polluted our air",
      " And I think that there are far-, long-reaching consequences to the choices that they made and the choices that they continue to make by not cleaning that up appropriately",
      " And we know that's true, because the EPA went in, and basically to ignore it, they did not clean up that site",
      "So that way there tells me exactly how long this is going to affect me and the residents of East Palestine",
      " I believe that if Norfolk would have stood up and did the right thing, from the minute this happened, it possibly could have gone away at some point",
      " But because they have been neglectful, because they put profit over people, and because they thought that they were just going to be able to sweep this under the rug, they were negligent and they didn't care what was gonna happen",
      " And they thought that they would get their train tracks built and trains were going to run through here",
      " And that's all they cared about",
      " And that's not what happened",
      " And now they're being held accountable for their actions",
      " And the sad thing is, as I hope that they realize that 20 years from now, when women are losing their uterus, when women can't have children, when people are dying from kidney disease, lung cancer, liver cancer, I really hope that they would look back and realize that what they've done here is an absolute shame",
      "GT: You set up a donation on the platform of Give Send Go, hoping to bring your children to other places",
      " Do you think the government could provide any help?DeSanzo: It should be the government's job to take care of people who want to relocate for the time being so that they can protect their children",
      " That's not what's happening",
      " I shouldn't have to be raising my own money",
      " I shouldn't have to be asking for donations from other people either",
      " I should be getting help from FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency)",
      " And by them not giving us that help, I can say what's going on here is crossing the line of being neglectful to criminal",
      "There are some types of cheap, temporary housing for the residents who are having symptoms, the residents whose children are sick and just don't feel safe",
      " Why? They're doing the cleanup here",
      " And they relocate us into temporary housing at no cost to us",
      " That's why we pay taxes as Americans",
      " So if there is a disaster, we have governmental services to come in and aid with help",
      " But when we had to evacuate our house, they said that people were refusing to leave",
      " That's a lie",
      " People were not refusing to leave",
      " It's that people don't have the means to leave",
      "I've worked my entire life",
      " I was a single mother for 16 years, and I raised my three younger children all by myself",
      " It's very hard for Appalachian people to ask for a handout",
      "But that's what the government and what Norfolk Southern have forced me to do, because they are refusing to provide me with the help that I should be entitled to",
      " If a United States citizen goes to a government official or goes to a corporation that is basically poisoning them and says my children are sick, my children have not been well for going on 20 days, do you not think that it's my right as the United States citizen to get some kind of aid or some kind of assistance to help me so that I can protect my children? They're not helping, they're leaving me with my hands tied",
      "GT: The US always claims to be a guardian of human rights, and criticizes the human rights of other countries",
      " What's your take on this?DeSanzo: As of what I've seen go on here in my town, I don't think the US government has any right to judge others on how they take care of their citizens",
      " The treatment that has been handed down to the folks here in East Palestine is absolutely horrendous",
      "GT: What's your expectation for the Chinese media in reporting the derailment accident?DeSanzo: I think that makes them tremble in their boots",
      " Our town is so tiny",
      " It's just crazy to see how much coverage it just has",
      " But I think that the Chinese media can play a huge role and help Norfolk do the right thing, helping even spread coverage further",
      " Like I said, when companies, government, elected officials see that they're being watched by not only the United States, but by media sources from other countries, it forces their hand",
      "And my biggest thing is what I would want from the Chinese media is don't let us be forgotten, because that is my biggest fear with the media and the US",
      " Things happen so quickly that one day, this is a headline, the next day, the headline is something new",
      "And I can't stress the importance of us not being forgotten, because I believe as soon as the pressure is left off of these corporations by these elected officials, they're going to slack and they're going to falter, they're not going to follow through on their promises that they've made to this town and all the residents there",
      "Please keep fighting for us",
      " Don't let us be forgotten",
      " I think that this is far from over",
      " And I think that we have a long battle ahead of us",
      " And I think that with the news coverage that's going on, that will protect our citizens more",
      " I would love for the Chinese media to keep East Palestine's name in the headlines and keep us in your prayers and help us fight the good fight",

      " Threatening peace",
      " Illustration: Liu Rui/Global TimesA year ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Beijing at start of the Winter Olympics, issuing a joint statement that called on the West to abandon the ideologized approaches of the Cold War",
      " The statement expressed their shared opposition to the further expansion of NATO and emphasized the need for long-term legally binding security guarantees in Europe",
      "President Xi said the two sides have taken an active part in the reform and development of the global governance system, followed true multilateralism",
      " A year later, with NATO's horrifying proxy war against Russia dragging on, the people of the world are living, and dying, with the consequences of the US and its allies' stubborn refusal to join the path of multipolarity",
      "With the benefit of hindsight, the Ukraine crisis has acquired a certain tragic inevitability",
      " Russia had made its red lines perfectly clear over the course of many years: that Ukraine must never become part of NATO; that NATO's expansion must end; that Ukraine must never be allowed to be used as a launching pad for war on Russia; and that the national rights of the Russian-speaking peoples of eastern Ukraine must be respected",
      "As John Wojcik wrote in the left-wing US journal People's World in January 2022, what happens in Ukraine is of critical importance to the survival of Russia",
      " \"From Napoleon to the Kaiser to Hitler, Russia has been invaded too many times from Europe, and it is understandably determined to maintain a militarily non-aligned buffer zone on its border",
      "\"It was within the West's power to prevent the current war, and it remains within the West's power to put a stop to it now",
      " Unfortunately the leading Western power, the US, has only a marginal interest in helping to bring about peace in Europe",
      " If the US wanted peace, it could have supported Ukraine in adopting a path of military neutrality and building friendly and mutually-beneficial relations with both East and West",
      " But the US prioritizes hegemony over peace, and has therefore constantly meddled in Ukraine with a view to exploiting its people and geography to project imperial power against Russia",
      "Guardian journalist Martin Kettle said the quiet part out loud recently, observing that \"sending tanks to Ukraine makes one thing clear: this is now a western war against Russia",
      "\" The West is pursuing a policy of gradual, continuous escalation in Ukraine - recycling a strategy that it used against the Soviets in Afghanistan four decades ago",
      " Its end-game is to significantly weaken Russia, cripple the Russian economy, undermine public support for the Putin government, and fertilize the ground for the emergence of a new government in Moscow willing to follow Washington's instructions",
      "Such a policy is not pursued out of any specific hatred of Russia, but as part of a broader global campaign to assert US hegemony and break the trajectory toward a multipolar system of international relations",
      " At the same time as attacking Russia, the US is also escalating its long-term campaign to contain and encircle China",
      "NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated in a recent visit to South Korea that \"China poses a challenge to our values, to our interests and to our security",
      "\" One has to wonder whether by \"our values and interests\" he means hegemony, warmongering, plutocracy, profiteering, and domination of the world's land, resources and markets",
      "These desperate attempts to roll back the multipolar process are not destined to bear fruit",
      " Even among the countries of Western Europe - with which the US shares a political ideology, a set of cultural values and an enduring commitment to white supremacy - there is diminishing enthusiasm for a reckless new Cold War, which is already contributing to serious economic difficulties in Britain, Germany and elsewhere",
      " German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has reluctantly agreed to allow German Leopard 2 tanks to be delivered to Ukraine, but only after sustained pressure",
      "In the Global South, such pressure has increasingly little impact",
      " Soon after capitulating on the tanks issue, Scholz travelled to Brazil to visit the newly-inaugurated President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva",
      " Asked whether Brazil would provide weapons to Ukraine, Lula stated firmly that \"our war is against poverty, not Russia",
      "\"Lula made an important suggestion: that China, Brazil, India and Indonesia - \"a club of countries that want to build peace on the planet\" - could take the lead in mediating a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict",
      " He added that \"our friends the Chinese play a very important role",
      "\"The idea of China and other responsible countries of the Global South taking a lead on mediation is gaining traction",
      " Professor Jeffrey Sachs recently wrote an article in the Economist that \"neutral nations including Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and South Africa\" could have an important role in facilitating a negotiated end to the conflict and becoming \"the co-guarantors to begin a new era of peace and rebuilding",
      "\"People who have critical thinking skills recognize that the US and NATO are incapable of, and unwilling to, clear up the mess they created",
      " Herein lies the profound irony",
      " The US is waging war on multipolarity, but a major effect of this war is to highlight to the peoples of the world the indispensable and urgent need for a multipolar future",

      " Wang said the rescue work must be carried out in full force, according to the official statement released by the Ministry of Emergency Management on Thursday evening",
      "The ministry urged the investigation to be carried out seriously and pursue responsibilities in accordance with the law",
      "As of 6 am Thursday, more than 900 personnel had rushed to the site for rescue operations, the Xinhua News Agency reported",
      "Experts from the central authorities, the autonomous region and other relevant provinces and regions had arrived at the rescue site",
      "The rescue operation is complex, as the mining area is located within a valley",
      " After the collapse, the bottom of the operation surface was basically buried",
      "The incident occurred in the western section of the coal mine",
      " The mountain slope in the western mining area collapsed",
      " After the collapse, it formed a mound of dirt that ran 500 meters east to west and 200 meters north to south",
      "Video footage from the mine's cameras showed that the collapse occurred at around 1 pm and lasted for about 30 to 40 seconds",
      " At about 6:44 pm, a second major landslide occurred at the site and halted search and rescue efforts",
      "In order to ensure the safety of the rescue workers, according to the advice of the expert group, all the rescue workers and vehicles were then evacuated to a safe area",
      " The expert group carried out on-site assessments overnight, formulated an optimized rescue plan, and then organized the rescue",
      "All the rescue forces have been put in place, medical rescue forces and ambulances have been prepared, and the power supply and communication support for the on-site emergency command has been put in place",
      "The mine was originally a closed site, but in 2012 it was transformed into an open-pit mine",
      " Production resumed in April 2021 following a three-year suspension",
      "Wang Hongwei, a professor at the Renmin University of China's School of Public Administration and Policy, told the Global Times on Thursday that as the area of the collapse almost covered the whole slope of the mine, removing the large amount of earth in the short term would be very challenging",
      "Plus, the collapsed area is located in a V-shaped valley, so there was less opportunity for miners to escape, and rescue teams had limited scope to launch their work, Wang noted",
      "But when the collapse occurred, many miners might have been operating excavators and dump trucks",
      " In this case, many buried personnel may be in the interiors of the carriages, and the cabs of the carriages can form a space of shelter, which may increase the possibility of survival for those who were buried, he said",
      "He said an open-pit mine is usually less likely to have an accident than an underground mine",
      " Although the specific cause of the disaster remains unknown, if the monitoring of the slope is strengthened, the possibility of the occurrence of such emergencies would be reduced and the risk can be effectively controlled, said Wang",
      "Some observers believe there may have been man-made factors to this disaster, such as overexploitation of the mountain, which caused a structural imbalance, thus leading to the collapse",
      "The Global Times found the company had been put on China's credit blacklist",

      " By using the balloon saga, some US politicians have pushed anti-China sentiments in Washington to a climax in recent weeks so as to push the China-US relations to nadir",
      " Aside from drumming up the rhetoric of the alleged \"China threat,\" US officials are hyping up a more sensational accusation by claiming China has a \"wider fleet\" of balloons that span five continents for surveillance",
      "However, earlier news reports on balloons have told a different story from the US narrative - the reports showed that the US is the very country that has flown balloons all over the world with records of US balloons entering many countries' air spaces",
      " The US also has an infamous history of using balloons for close-in reconnaissance on other countries, especially during the 1950s and 1960s, let alone its pervasive eavesdropping worldwide",
      "The US' abuse of military forces in shooting down the Chinese civilian airship for meteorological purposes not only violates international customs but also sets a dangerous precedent for the handling of deviated civilian balloons that have been widely used in collecting atmospheric data among other physical scientific experiments, analysts said",
      "The US' absurd and hysterical overreaction toward the Chinese balloon and its unceasing hyping up of spy rhetoric increased the international community's worries not only over strained China-US relations, but also over scientific research using balloons",
      "Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, a spokesperson with China's Ministry of National Defense, told a press conference on Thursday that \"We firmly reject the irresponsible and groundless remarks made by some people in the US",
      " The real threat to the global and regional security and stability is certain country's self-centered values and narrow-mind security value and zero-sum game mentality",
      "\"Amid the US' political stunt against the Chinese airship, the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) released a statement on February 17 to highlight the key role of weather balloons in climate monitoring and it said that every day, free-rising latex balloons are released simultaneously from almost 900 locations worldwide",
      "Nearly 1,000 balloons gather daily observations that provide real-time input",
      " The valuable information gathered by the balloons contributes to computer forecast models, local data for meteorologists to make forecasts and predict storms, and climate monitoring and data for research to better understand weather and climate processes, said WMO",
      "Some innocent balloons have been blown out of the sky as one of the three balloons, which were shot down by a US fighter jet in the North American air space, reportedly belongs to a Canadian hobbyist group, leading to growing worries among scientists and researchers over the safety of civilian balloons",
      "The United Launch Alliance launches its last Delta IV heavy rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California on September 24, 2022",

      " Photo: VCGNumerous balloon projects in USThe US is among the countries that have initiated programs on balloons for decades",
      " For example, more than 30 years ago, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) set up the NASA Balloon Program which has \"provided high-altitude scientific balloon platforms for scientific and technological investigations,\" according to an overview of the program on the NASA website",
      "Launch locations of balloons for the NASA project released on the NASA website cover the scope of North America, Europe, and the Indo-Pacific region with three in the US, one in Sweden, one in Australia, one in New Zealand and one in Antarctica",
      " Moreover, NASA's Balloon Program Office also said it uses multiple types of balloons to \"lift scientific payloads into the atmosphere,\" including zero-pressure, super-pressure, and planetary ballooning systems",
      "Aside from NASA, American companies and various organizations and clubs in the US have flown numerous balloons for commercial purposes or just as hobbies with many floating around the world",
      "For example, in August 2020, a large silver-colored contraption fitted with solar panels and wires was found parachuting into the dense Congo jungle, which caused public controversy and speculation surrounding the unidentified flying object and also led to the detainment of two people, according to local authorities, Reuters reported",
      "The subsidiary of the Google parent company Alphabet later confirmed that the balloon belonged to the Loon Project - a project that claimed to create a network of balloons traveling on the troposphere stratosphere",
      "As balloon activities by scientific research organizations and companies around the world become more frequent, so were cross-border flights, especially those from the US",
      "Zhu Yaochun, deputy secretary-general of the China Air Transport Association, told the Global Times that in international practice, civilian unmanned aircraft that accidentally enter another country's airspace should be escorted, warned, expelled, or forced to land",
      "Compared to previous reports on how other countries dealt with US balloons' \"entry\" into their airspaces, the US' shooting down of the Chinese airship using a fighter jet and missiles was a conspicuous overreaction and violation of international law and norms, observers said",
      "Infamous historyAlthough the US kept propagating the Chinese \"spy balloon\" narrative, it failed to provide proof to support its accusations even with the debris of the shot-down Chinese balloon having been collected and assessed",
      "Some analysts noted that maybe the Biden administration and the US military also find they have been lifting a stone that will end up failing on their own feet, and to appease American taxpayers, they have to continue the political balloon stunt",
      "While the US racks its brain in tarnishing China's image by hyping up a so-called Chinese balloon fleet, its infamous history of spying and eavesdropping worldwide has kept reverberating in history and modern times, with its spy balloon operations being traced back to the early days of the Cold War in the middle 20th century",
      "Historical materials show that after the WWII, the US Air Force started developing the concept of \"plastic balloon reconnaissance\" at around 1946 to spy on Russia, and it had test-launched over 500 reconnaissance balloons by the middle of 1954",

      "The US Air Force's launching of reconnaissance balloons later evolved into the infamous Project Genetrix, also known as WS-119L",
      " It was a program designed to launch surveillance balloons over the now defunct Soviet Union, as well as China and Eastern Europe with the help of a U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, to take aerial photographs as part of its intelligence gathering",

      "Despite strong protests by the international community, the US Air Force launched another balloon reconnaissance program in 1957, designated WS-461L",

      "Balloons have also been widely used in collecting intelligence",
      " In 2021, the above-mentioned Loon Project was scrapped by Alphabet and Raven Aerostar, which claimed to be the world leader in high-altitude, lighter-than-air technology, acquired intellectual property and patents from Loon",

      "The Drive report also noted that Raven Aerostar's Thunderhead balloons are designed to be able to persist over an area of interest in order to carry out a wide variety of tasks",
      " Moreover, according to the company, common applications include intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and act as communications relays",
      " Additionally, the balloons can also serve in augmenting navigational systems",

      "Analysts said that the discovery of a US sail drone in Namibian territorial waters signified the increasing tendency of US spying in every corner of the world, and countries should be vigilant as US investment in intelligence globally will pose a bigger threat",
      "Song noted that it is such typical hegemonic and double-standard mind-set by the US that doesn't allow balloon launching by other countries while persisting in the action itself",

      " A year later, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has profoundly changed the international geopolitics, and severely weakened the foundation for international cooperation",
      " Its spillover effects in various areas such as politics, security and the economy have far exceeded people's imagination",
      " This geopolitical conflict has become a microcosm of the turbulence of this era",
      "On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden delivered speeches in Moscow and Warsaw, respectively, about the conflict",
      " Both showed determination to achieve their respective goals",
      " This may indicate that the conflict will continue for some time",
      " Also during the past two days, the UN General Assembly resumed its 11th emergency special session to discuss the situation in Ukraine",
      " Assembly President Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si stressed that military solutions will not end this conflict, while expressing firm support for a political solution",
      " At the same time, China will also release a position paper on political solutions of the Ukraine crisis on the one-year anniversary of the conflict, which is highly anticipated by the world",
      "The European continent is at a critical crossroads: on one side, if the confrontation continues to escalate, it could lead to unforeseeable catastrophic consequences, including the risk of using nuclear weapons; on the other side, there are increasing calls for a political solution to the crisis and for achieving peace as soon as possible, which has become a universal desire of the international community",
      "The Russia-Ukraine conflict has a complex historical context, and ignoring this fact may lead to an incomplete understanding of the path to resolving the conflict, or even to unrealistic solutions",
      " Ukraine was once a part of the Soviet Union and has a complicated domestic ethnic situation, coupled with its geographic location sandwiched between NATO and Russia",
      " These objective circumstances require Ukraine to exercise extreme caution when dealing with its foreign relations, clarify and grasp its own interests, and become a bridge for promoting positive relations among major powers",
      "However, since 2014, when the US instigated a \"color revolution\" in Ukraine, Washington has been inciting further hostility between Ukraine and Russia, leading to a large number of conflicts in eastern Ukraine",
      " At the same time, Europe has failed to establish a security framework that spans the Eurasian continent",
      " The existing security mechanism, centered on NATO, completely excludes Russia and has repeatedly initiated NATO's eastward expansion",
      " In a sense, the Russia-Ukraine conflict is a major outbreak of historical grievances between Russia and the West",
      " It is in itself a failure of the American and European diplomatic and security framework in Eurasia",
      "There are no winners in conflicts or wars, and complex problems do not have simple answers",
      " Confrontations between great powers must be avoided",
      " This is the biggest warning left by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which should prompt deeper thinking about security in Europe and other parts of the world",
      " It requires sustained efforts, which include adhering to the principles of the United Nations Charter, valuing the legitimate security concerns of all countries, and self-restraint of major powers before carrying out their global ambitions",
      " The latter is equally urgent now because one of the biggest spillover effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is that some great powers are attempting to replicate a similar confrontation in the Asia-Pacific region, which could have a much greater impact than what is happening on the European continent",
      "The Russia-Ukraine conflict should not continue any further",
      " The parties deeply embroiled in the conflict need to calm down as soon as possible and stop pushing the narrative of the conflict toward a bloc rivalry",

      "\" Bloc rivalry only intensifies the conflict and makes the possibility of peace more remote",

      "On Sunday, White House national security adviser Jack Sullivan told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that aiding Russia would be \"a bad mistake\" and the US will continue to send \"a strong message\" to China against \"giving military aid to Moscow",
      "\" In an interview with CBS News on Saturday, CIA Director Bill Burns expressed confidence that China \"is considering the provision of lethal equipment\" to Russia",
      "Both Sullivan and Burns admitted that there's no evidence of actual shipments of lethal equipment from China to Russia",

      " (Xinhua/Li Xin)Multiple places across China such as Hangzhou in East China's Zhejiang Province have introduced or stepped up financial incentives, including a one-off subsidy, to families with a third child, to encourage couples to have more babies",
      "Hangzhou plans to hand out a one-off subsidy of 20,000 yuan ($2,902) to local couples with a third child and a 5,000 yuan subsidy to those with a second child, following new local population data and research that showed that local couples have low intentions to have more children, the Zhejiang Daily reported on Wednesday",

      "37 million as of the end of 2022",
      " The proportion of second children among newborns peaked at 52",

      "Many localities have rolled out economic incentives since the beginning of this year to bolster population growth rates",
      "Shenyang in Northeast China's Liaoning Province will offer subsidies of 500 yuan per month to local families with a third child until the child reaches 3 years old, as part of a plan to optimize the population structure and improve the quality of the population by 2025",
      "Other areas like Chengdu and Jinan also launched support policies for second and third children",
      "The effect of economic incentives still depends on couples' willingness to have children, Song Jian, a demographer at the Center for Population and Development Studies of the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Thursday",

      "During the process, it was confirmed that carrier-based fighter jets and helicopters took off and landed on the aircraft carrier Liaoning, according to the press release",

      "The participating vessels in the carrier group this time are regarded as unprecedented, with a record number of Type 055 large destroyers, so the drills should involve new training courses that integrate those new elements into the group, the expert said",
      "Following US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative visit to the island of Taiwan in early August, the PLA launched a large-scale exercise in response, demonstrating its capabilities in locking down the island",
      "The aircraft carrier Liaoningapparently did not participate in the drills at that time, so this is likely the first time the carrier has held an exercise in the region since the Pelosi event, observers said",
      "With Pelosi having worsened the situation in the Taiwan Straits and Japan recently adopting new national security strategies breaking away from its defense-only principle, the PLA must continue to enhance its capabilities in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, analysts said",

      " Australia, US Illustration: Liu Rui/Global TimesThe Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based think tank, released the Asia Power Index for 2023 on Sunday",
      " Created in 2018, the index measures powers based on 133 indicators across eight core themes",
      " Since the index was launched in 2018, the US, China, Japan, India, and Russia, in that order, have been the top five powerful nations",
      "Most countries saw a decline in their overall scores due to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic last year",
      " The US lost 1",
      "5 points, while Japan lost 1",
      "4 points",
      " But China saw the biggest drop in score, dropping 2",
      "1 points relative to 2021, which is also as the largest drop in this edition",
      "The US displaced China as the top-ranked country for economic capability",
      " Susannah Patton, the project lead for the index, said China's score had dipped across almost every indicator as the country's connections with the rest of Asia declined \"sharply",
      "\"However, China's status and strength could not be influenced by some measures taken in a short period of time",
      " It is often said that Rome was not built in a day",
      " The rise of China is a long-term process, and it is impossible for it to cause drastic changes because of what happened in a year, L\u00fc Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, indicated",
      "Now, Western media, politicians and think tanks, including Lowy, are talking about China's anti-epidemic policies as if they are trying to smear China to find an excuse for their own anti-epidemic failures",
      " They have turned a blind eye to US' mishandling of the epidemic, which caused social turmoil and severe economic damage",
      " By contrast, once it comes to China's issues, they will endlessly exaggerate or even distort facts",
      " But the facts prove that China's anti-epidemic policy is very successful, and it can even be said to be the most successful example in the world",
      "As a pivotal economic force in the Asia-Pacific region, China played a very crucial role in sustaining the Asia-Pacific economy and even the world economy in the fight against the epidemic",
      " This includes providing necessary supplies and vaccines to other countries during the pandemic",
      "Chen Hong, director of the Australian Studies Center at East China Normal University, pointed out that Lowy's release of the report at this time will play a misleading role in world public opinion",
      " Chen has spotted a modus operandi in the anti-China campaign in some Western countries, in which more often than not, anti-China political forces or interest groups would feed misinformation or some unsubstantiated \"leads\" to the media, which would, in turn, hype it up",
      " During this process, some think tanks would play their part in due course to act in disguise as academic authorities",
      " Sometimes they would conduct surveys with misleading results to influence public opinion",
      " Chen said, adding that Lowy Institute, is an influential think tank and should cling to academic impartiality and independent judgment rather than being affected by political pressures",
      "In fact, the US' economic data is not performing as well as the country had hoped",
      " Inflation, interest rate hikes, and recession can be said to be high-frequency words for the US economy in 2022",
      "Patton did not forget to appeal to Washington in the article titled \"China's Reopening, America's Challenge\" published in the Straits Times, saying that the year ahead promises to be an inflection point for China's power in Asia",
      " The Biden administration will need to adapt its strategy to compete with China in 2023",
      "Australia's Lowy Institute represents one of the most loyal American allies",
      " For them, the fear is that if the US goes down, they will go down with it",
      "But in the long run, with the gradual weakening of US influence in the Asia-Pacific region, there is no doubt that China's role in the Asia-Pacific region will increase",
      " Thus, Lowy's conclusion is more like a wish",
      " The forces represented by Lowy think they can benefit from relying on the US",
      " This is a very unhealthy \"zero-sum game\" mentality",
      "The current Australian government has actually begun to reflect on the unfriendly China-Australia relationship",
      " However, some politicians and think tanks in Australia always believe that if they can stand on the side of the US, they will benefit in the end",
      " This is very unfavorable for a country like Australia to achieve a stable external environment",
      "\"Lowy, as a prominent think tank, needs to realize that academic institutions should maintain academic independence, not serve interest groups or the geopolitical strategy of a certain superpower",
      " For the recent Lowy Power Index, it is no longer just a matter of taking sides",
      " Think tanks should not instrumentalize themselves to become a tool for anti-China forces, which would taint their academic reputation,\" Chen said",

      "According to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Monday, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong will hold the 17th China-Japan security dialogue and the 29th regular diplomatic consultation with Japanese Senior Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Shigeo Yamada",
      "Issues of common concern are expected addressed during the meeting - a once-regular fixture which has not been held since 2019",
      " Potential topics in the dialogue include Japan's long-term policy guidelines in its new National Security Strategy, which was updated in December 2022, and the situation over the Taiwan region, Japanese media reported, citing a government source",
      "The dialogue comes amid Japan's move of scaling up its defense forces, the industrial high-tech blockade against China, which includes semiconductors, and more provocative statements related to the Taiwan question",
      "The talks will not provide an immediate solution to old and new intractable problems between China and Japan, but they will promote mutual trust and provide a platform to manage divergences and prevent them from escalating into conflict, according to Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences",
      "The meeting also comes after Japan's accusation from its defense ministry that it \"strongly suspects\" that objects which flew over Japan in 2019, 2020 and 2021 were Chinese balloons",
      " Chinese analysts viewed the accusation as the latest demonstration of Tokyo's political game to coordinate with the US' hypes of the balloon incident",
      "Although the exchange could help manage divergences and prevent them from escalating into conflict, Chinese analysts said that the huge gap between China and Japan on a political level would be a major obstacle for the dialogue, as Japan intends to make China submit to the so-called international order based on US dominance, while neglecting China's goodwill in building a mutually beneficial, good partnership with Japan",

      "5 billion, on the top of that it has already provided Ukraine with financial support worth $600 million along with hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of emergency humanitarian assistance",
      "Given that the Kishida administration has been increasingly attempting to justify its ongoing militarization under the pretext of the so-called external threats amid the Ukraine crisis, Japan's strengthening of support to Ukraine could be seen as efforts to keep up with US-led NATO and to sell the provocative saying of \"a Taiwan emergency is a Japanese emergency,\" by falsely comparing the Ukraine crisis to the cross-Straits situations, Chinese analysts warned",

      "The US military's actions are a serious violation of China's sovereignty and security, and irrefutable proof of its hegemony in navigation and militarization of the South China Sea, Tian Junli, a spokesperson of the PLA Southern Theater Command, said on Tuesday, noting that such behavior fully reveals that the US is the provocateur against peace in the region",
      "China holds indisputable sovereignty over the South China Sea islands and their adjacent waters, and the PLA Southern Theater Command maintains a high state of readiness at all times to resolutely defend the country's sovereignty, security and peace and stability in the South China Sea region",
      "It is the first case of a US warship trespassing into waters of China's territory since leaders of the two sides met in Bali, Indonesia in November",
      " Experts said that the move suggests that China-US rivalry in the South China Sea will be a long-term phenomenon, and the US won't stop its provocations against China's sovereignty",

      "Rejecting China's claims, the US Navy said that the USS Chancellorsville \"conducted this FONOP (Freedom of Navigation Operation) in accordance with international law and then continued on to conduct normal operations in waters where high seas freedoms apply,\" the Navy's spokesperson said in a statement, media reported",

      " Illustration: Liu Rui/GTMore than half a year ago, Brandon Bochenski, Republican mayor of Grand Forks, a city in North Dakota, asked \"Are we going to be the first one to basically say no to globalism?\" His question came after a Chinese company's plan to build a local corn mill unexpectedly caused controversies",
      " As a firm supporter of that project, Bochenski called the opposition voices \"a large push away from globalization",
      "\"But just two days ago, Bochenski himself said he would seek the City Council's help to block construction by trying to deny building permits and by refusing to connect city infrastructure to the building site",
      " North Dakota's Republican governor, Doug Burgum, who celebrated with Bochenski in late 2021 when Grand Forks landed the project, also changed his attitude",
      " The US media claimed that the project hit \"what appears to be an insurmountable hurdle",
      "\" The question Bochenski asked half a year ago has become a reality",
      " The answer given by reality is ironic, bitter and helpless, and it has become yet another practical action of the US to \"say no to globalism",
      "\"Even the New York Times admitted that the project had been welcomed as an economic development success",
      " So why did the dramatic reversal occur in just a few months? What is the force and emotion driving behind? The attitudes of people like Bochenski and Burgum have changed so much that it is not normal",
      " While questioning these, we have made many discoveries worth deep thinking",
      " They reflect the complete process of how Americans' pragmatic rationality toward China has been eroded, coerced, and slowly deteriorated, and even reveal the internal logic of why today's China-US relations have gone so distorted",
      "Although Grand Forks has the word \"grand\" in its name, it is actually very small, with a population of only 50,000 to 60,000, and the total population of North Dakota is less than 800,000",
      " It is located in the Midwest of the US, with a cold climate and a relatively backward economy",
      " According to Mayor Bochenski, 18 percent of the residents in Grand Forks live in poverty, far higher than the national average",
      " Therefore, when the American branch of China Fufeng Group purchased land in the city and planned to build a corn milling plant, the mayor and governor who hoped to promote local economic development and employment opportunities were both very happy, considering it a \"huge opportunity",
      "\" No matter from which point of view, this is a mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation, and it fully complies with the market norms of the US",
      "However, the subsequent development of the matter surprised many US media",
      " In a society with diverse interests, it is not surprising that some people do not support this project",
      " What is strange is the reasons for their opposition and why this matter has caused such a big stir in the US",
      " Initially some people said that the city's water supply was not enough to support the operation of the corn milling plant, and others complained about possible odors or traffic congestion (in a city of 50,000 to 60,000 people), etc",
      " When these concerns were proved to be unnecessary, some people finally found a very lethal breakthrough -- the \"China threat\" theory, claiming that the proposed corn milling plant is not far from a US Air Force base, and might be used by \"China to monitor the air base",
      "\" Although this is obviously far-fetched and alarmist, but in the US, which is currently highly hostile to China, such a farce is performed publicly",
      "Anti-China politicians in Washington are obsessed with such a topic, and it soon caught the attention of the Congress with one Republican federal senator telling US Air Force general that \"Maybe it's just a corn mill",
      " But it would also provide the potential, at least, for Chinese intelligence to engage in intelligence collection of various kinds",
      "\" These are typical unwarranted charges",
      " Eventually, even the city had voluntarily shared information about its interactions with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US and said it didn't view the proposed corn-milling activity as a national security concern, the US Air Force still sent a letter to the Grand Forks, claiming \"The proposed project presents a significant threat to national security with both near- and long-term risks of significant impacts to our operations in the area,\" which dealt a fatal blow to the project",
      " This is the result of selective blindness of blind anti-China politicians",
      "Throughout the whole incident, economic laws and market principles have been squeezed to the corner step by step by so called political and security concerns",
      " A normal investment project has been sabotaged by abnormal means to the extent that the business environment of the US is as uncertain and unpredictable as a country in political turmoil and it doesn't look like a mature market",
      " \"National security\" is like the sword of Damocles, hanging over the heads of all foreign companies in the US",
      " This corn mill plant storm has not yet settled, and it should cause more Americans to reflect deeply",
      "At the same time, for those Chinese companies considering investing in the US, this incident is also a wake-up call",
      " Even in a sparsely populated remote area like North Dakota, the so-called national security may destroy normal investment projects at any time",

      " Chinese observers said the move can avoid escalation of tensions if miscalculation or other frictions happen between the two sides in their maritime and air relations",
      "Given that the two Asian powers have been at odds over some hot-button issues involving the East China Sea, the Diaoyu Islands and the South China Sea, Hayashi told a press conference that operating the hotline between Japanese and Chinese defense authorities will \"play an extremely important role in building confidence and avoiding unexpected contingencies,\" Kyodo News reported",
      "\"We will continue discussions with the Chinese side toward the realization\" of the hotline, Hayashi said, according to Kyodo",
      "The Kyodo News noted that Hayashi's remarks came after a meeting of leaders of state in Bangkok earlier this month in which an early start of the hotline was agreed upon",
      "On November 22, China and Japan held the 14th round of consultations under the high-level consultation mechanism on maritime affairs, during which the two sides acclaimed the performance of the defense sector's maritime and air liaison mechanism and the important progress in the launch of a direct telephone line under the mechanism",
      " They also confirmed that they would follow up on the subsequent work at a faster pace for early completion and launch of the telephone line, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry",
      "Japan and China launched the maritime and aerial communication mechanism in 2018, which aimed to increase mutual trust, manage differences and maintain peace and stability in the East China Sea area, according to the Xinhua News Agency",
      "Despite the launch of the mechanism, the two sides have made little progress on the hotline during the past years, Kyodo News noted",
      "With the hotline, possible frictions and escalation of tension between the two sides in maritime and air affairs are expected to be avoided in a timely manner, which would also ease the tensions and warm the ties between China and Japan, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Wednesday",
      "Since the first summit between the two Asian countries in almost three years took place on the fringes of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit earlier this month, the two countries have seen a series of positive signals in bilateral ties despite long-term differences on some sensitive issues",
      "Song also suggested that in the next step the two sides can strengthen exchanges in various fields, especially in non-traditional security fields, such as humanitarian relief, disaster prevention and mitigation, counter-terrorism, and anti-piracy efforts",
      "If the two militaries can deepen their cooperation, it can stabilize the situation in the Asian region and ease the tensions between the two countries, which would be in both countries' interests, Song noted",
      "The expert urged Japan to adhere to the consensus reached during the meeting between the two leaders of state, adhere to the one-China principle, refrain from provoking China on the Taiwan question and South China Sea issues, manage differences on the Diaoyu Islands issue, and stop colluding with the US under the so-called \"Indo-Pacific Strategy\" to contain China's peaceful development, so as to push forward healthy and mutually beneficial ties with China",
      " According to the Japan Times on Tuesday, Kishida has instructed his defense and finance chiefs to boost defense spending to two percent of GDP by 2027 - a target long sought by the ruling party but now referred to by Kishida as a specific budget figure for the first time",
      "Japan has long capped its annual defense spending at about 1 percent of GDP, or 5 trillion yen ($36 billion)",
      " The Defense Ministry said that 48 trillion yen will be required for the next five years to improve the country's defense capabilities, Kyodo News reported, citing the concern over \"China's growing military strength and North Korea's missile development",

      "\"Here is the rub: If the latest three objects were not linked to China, who do they belong to?On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that \"American military and civilian agencies have flown balloons over the US for a growing range of national-security applications, scientific research, intelligence collection and commercial uses, according to industry experts, former officials and government documents",

      "Analysts said the key for the CPC's anti-corruption campaign in its second centenary journey after the 20th CPC National Congress would be system construction and institutional development, as effective long-term sustainable self-governance and supervision that can deal with long-standing problems like corruption, misconduct and bureaucratism require a comprehensive and mature system to allow Party self-governance to keep up with the concept of law-based governance",
      "\"It will be long-term work that requires ceaseless efforts in combating corruption, and is crucial to ensuring the governance of the CPC in the country,\" Yang Xuedong, a professor of political science at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Monday",
      "More importantly, it's also a continuous campaign to combat corruption that needs system construction with comprehensive supervision, and the meeting's fundamental goal is to make sure the CPC's important decisions can be implemented correctly and effectively at different levels of the whole Party, Yang said",
      "Analysts said the work of discipline inspection is not just about fighting corruption, and in recent years, problems like bureaucratism and misconduct, which in fact are a form of irresponsible \"sloth administration,\" have seriously damaged the interests of the people, the normal operation of society, and the image of the Party",
      " Therefore, the main task in the work of discipline inspection in the future will also focus on dealing with these problems to further improve the governance capability of the CPC",

      "Experts said the documentary shows the CPC will maintain high pressure to deter corruption within the Party, and by showing the consequences and lessons of corrupt senior officials, as well as the law-enforcement process, the CPC is trying to keep educating the Party members to be loyal to the Party's central leadership and whole-heartedly respect and follow Party discipline, as well as show the Party's transparency and confidence in its anti-corruption campaign to the public",

      " Photo:VCGThe US, with around 750 military bases across the globe, warships in most oceans, which is waging a proxy war, stirring up conflicts here and there, is now vehemently making a fuss about so-called \"threats\" it is confronting: Earlier this month, it was balloons, and now, it is TikTok",
      "The White House on Monday gave government agencies 30 days to ensure they do not have short-video platform TikTok on federal devices and systems, Reuters reported on the same day",
      " In December last year, US Congress voted to bar federal employees from using the video app on government-owned devices",
      " Now, US President Joe Biden officially tossed out the deadline",
      "The decision is as unreasonable as Biden's order to shoot down balloons with missiles",
      " It is a typical irrational action generated by security anxiety stemming from a kind of mental illness, Shen Yi, an international relations expert from Fudan University, told the Global Times",
      "If the move reveals anything, it is that the US has gone hysterical in its anti-China stance while its relevant decisions have gone far beyond reality",
      " TikTok has been trying to demonstrate its global nature",
      " However, in the eyes of American elites, being born in China is an \"original sin",
      "\"Over the past years, TikTok has been questioned on whether the Chinese government has access to US user data; whether its content is censored by China; whether its stored US user data is based on US soil ",
      "",
      "",
      " However, after TikTok appropriately responded and met all these requirements, the US still claims the app is a \"national security threat",
      "\"In 2020, then president Donald Trump even tried to mandate that ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, strike a deal to sell TikTok's US operations",
      " In other words, the US government has been attempting to harm this globally leading short-video platform which was not born in the US, using various excuses",
      "The latest ban is aimed at government devices and will only affect a small portion of TikTok's users in the US, yet some observers believe that, the US is actually attempting to fan the flames of a wider call to ban the app throughout the country",
      " On the global arena, some US allies have already followed suit",
      " Also on Monday, Canada announced a ban on TikTok from government-issued devices",
      " Last week, the European Commission and Council of the EU, EU's two biggest policy-making institutions, banned staff from using the app",
      "It is a mystery why the US and its Western allies are afraid of TikTok, when there is no evidence to prove its \"danger,\" and when it is basically a purely entertainment platform, which people can download out of their own free will",
      " Against the backdrop, banning TikTok is absurd",
      " And the US is behaving like the emperor in the folktale \"The Emperor's New Clothes",
      "\" Don't ask why he has no clothes, he is just being unreasonable and even mentally ill, Shen said",
      "\"How unsure of itself can the world's top superpower be to fear a young people's favorite app like that?\" Mao Ning, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, asked at a daily briefing on Tuesday, when responding to the White House's TikTok ban",
      "It cannot be ruled out that the Biden administration needs some scores to demonstrate its capability to keep staying in the White House and protect so-called US national security, observers noted",
      " Moreover, reports show that TikTok was the most-downloaded app worldwide",
      " That being said, killing TikTok means US internet companies will have one less competitor",
      "US Federal Chief Information Security Officer Chris DeRusha said this latest decision on TikTok is \"part of the Administration's ongoing commitment to securing our digital infrastructure and protecting the American people's security and privacy",
      "\"US officials keep talking about \"American people's security and privacy,\" do they mean it? As George Galloway, a six-term British parliamentarian, tweeted, \"It's American intelligence, not Chinese, which is coming through your back door, your front door and all of your windows",
      "\"Worse, it was speculated that Washington's balloon frenzy earlier in February has a lot to do with covering up the scoop over what US did behind Nord Stream bombing",
      " There is also reason to suspect the hype of TikTok is aimed at distracting people from Ohio derailment and chemical spill",
      " Thanks to social media platforms like TikTok, short videos can be uploaded anytime and anywhere",
      " And they helped to push the story into the public when traditional mainstream media covered their eyes",
      " US' crumbling railway system is shocking, and US government's attempt to cover up the toxic train has been nakedly exposed to the world",

      "The incident occurred after the Hong Kong team defeated Iran 11-1 in Group B of the competition with the wrong song played for around 10 seconds",
      " Some members from the Hong Kong team made a \"T-gesture sign\" to signal the problem",
      "Similar incidents have been occurred last year during the international sports events where a song linked with Hong Kong's violent unrest in 2019 was played in the place of the Chinese national anthem, caused strong protest of the HKSAR government",
      "In November, World Rugby apologized to the Hong Kong Rugby Union for an error which appeared on the television broadcast of a match between the HKSAR and Portuguese teams at the Final Qualification Tournament for Rugby World Cup 2023, when an incorrect graphics caption was used when the Chinese National Anthem was played prior to the game",
      "And at the Asian Classic Powerlifting Championships in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in December 2022, after HK weight lifter Susanna Lin won a gold medal and stepped onto the podium, instead of playing the Chinese national anthem, a song associated with social turmoil in Hong Kong in 2019 was played, until the athlete made a T-sign gesture to stop the song after about 15 seconds before organizers changed the music into the right one",
      "On November 22, 2022, the SF&OC issued guidelines to all sports associations in the HKSAR for handling the broadcasting of national anthem and the hoisting of HKSAR flag during the participation of Hong Kong teams in international sports events",
      "It said that if an error occurs in such circumstances, athletes and team officials shall signify their objection with a T-sign gesture; if the organizer does not correct it immediately, the team leader shall lead all players in leaving the field",
      "The HKSAR government said in a statement on Wednesday that according to the game video, Hong Kong athletes have immediately protested in accordance with the guidelines issued by the SF&OC, prompting the organizers to make immediate corrections",
      " The HKSAR government affirmed the performance of Hong Kong athletes on the spot to safeguard the dignity of the country",
      "The HKSAR government attaches great importance to the incident and has requested the SF&OC to conduct in-depth investigations, including whether the relevant sports associations have followed the guidelines to re-check with the event organizers that the national anthem to be used is the correct version",
      "It also urged the SF&OC to submit a report as soon as possible and follow up the incident seriously",
      "In a statement sent by the SF&OC to the Global Times on Wednesday, it said it has been learning more information from the Hong Kong Ice Hockey Association and knew that the association, in line with the guidelines of the SF&OC, had submitted the correct version of the Chinese national anthem to the organizer and relevant team members responded appropriately and timely to the incident, which showed that the SF&OC's guidelines are effective",

      " It was on this pretext, which hasn't been supported by evidence and was vehemently denied by China, that US President Joe Biden ordered the Pentagon to shoot the airship down over the Atlantic Ocean",
      " That dramatic decision violated the spirit of international law and related practices",
      "Everything that the US has claimed about the weather balloon incident has been nothing but a lot of hot air and hype",
      " Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin revealed on February 13 during a regular press briefing that US high-altitude balloons have illegally flown over Chinese airspace on more than 10 occasions without the approval of the relevant Chinese authorities since January 2022",
      " He also disclosed that the US resorted to more dangerous means for spying on China too",
      "According to him, \"The US has also frequently sent aircraft and warships to conduct close-in reconnaissance on China, with 657 flights in 2022 and 64 flights in the South China Sea in January this year alone",
      "\" These revelations and the timing thereof enable everyone to better understand why the balloon incident was a lot of hot air and hype",
      " For starters, it's the US that has engaged in espionage and abused the use of its armed forces across the world",
      " Washington is thus in no position to lecture China",
      "Second, as evidenced by Wang's remarks, China responsibly handled all such violations of international law in accordance with related customary practices by addressing them discretely behind closed doors",
      " It wisely decided not to hype them up in order to avoid further worsening bilateral relations that have already been deteriorating as a result of the US' unilateral hybrid war aggression against China",
      " This is the proper way for mature countries to resolve such incidents",
      "The third point of criticism related to how the US handled the weather balloon incident earlier this month is that its decision-makers deliberately chose to defy those previously mentioned customary practices and ultimately violate international law by shooting down China's civilian airship",
      " Against the backdrop of what Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang just revealed, this confirms that the US had politically self-interested reasons in manipulating global perceptions about China and this incident",
      "Building upon the above, the fourth point relates to the impression that all objective observers now have of the US being the thief who dishonestly accuses others of stealing in order to cover up their own crimes",
      " The US must have known that China would reveal its spying operations on China in the aftermath of American perception managers hyping up the weather balloon incident, but it still shamelessly thought that it could achieve some short-term benefit by blowing hot air around",
      "And finally, while it can't be known what exactly motivated the US to engage in such an unfriendly act against China, there's no doubt that its hegemonic hubris played a major role in influencing its counterproductive calculations",
      " Had US decision-makers calmly thought everything through, they'd never have hyped up the accidental overflight of a Chinese civilian airship researching the weather since they'd have realized how aggressive, hypocritical, and paranoid it would make their country look",
      "In hindsight, the Chinese civilian weather balloon incident will go down in history as an example of a hubristic hegemon projecting its own crimes onto an innocent country and then overreacting out of guilt by violating international law and related practices to ridiculously shoot down that wayward object",
      " Far from being the moment of pride that the Biden Administration is trying to spin it as, it's an embarrassment that never should have happened and only makes the US look worse than ever before",

      " For a safer world, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, a senior Chinese diplomat said here Saturday",
      " Power politics and hegemony are a recipe for global instability and do the biggest damage to world peace, Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said in a keynote speech at the 59th Munich Security Conference (MSC)",
      " Interference in other countries' internal affairs, in whatever name, disregards and defies the basic norms governing international relations, said Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee",
      " Any violation of the one-China principle on the Taiwan question, and any attempt to create \"one China, one Taiwan\" or \"two Chinas,\" however framed, are a gross infringement on China's territorial integrity and pose real threats to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, he warned",
      " The principle of sovereignty is a cornerstone of the contemporary international order, and all countries should abide by the principle in both words and deeds rather than apply it selectively or with double standards, Wang said",
      " China will resolutely curb acts of separatism and interference to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said",
      " Wang noted that for a safer world, disputes should be peacefully resolved through dialogue and consultation",
      " Disagreements and frictions do exist between countries, yet handling them with pressuring, smear campaigns or unilateral sanctions is often counterproductive, and may even entail endless trouble, he said",
      " However complex the issue is, dialogue and consultation should not be abandoned; However intense the dispute is, a political resolution should be pursued; However difficult the situation is, peace should be given a chance, said the senior diplomat",
      " China follows a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security advocated by President Xi Jinping, and takes a responsible stand on international disputes based on the merits of each issue and plays a constructive role, Wang said",
      " On the Ukraine issue, China's position boils down to supporting and promoting peace talks, he said, adding that China will put forth its position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, and stand firmly on the side of peace and dialogue",
      " For a safer world, the purposes and principles of the United Nations (UN) Charter should be upheld, Wang noted",
      " The chaos and conflicts plaguing the world today occur because the purposes and principles of the charter have not been truly observed, he said",
      " Fanning ideological confrontation and forming exclusionary blocs harms international solidarity and hampers global cooperation, while hyping security threats and stoking tensions undercuts strategic mutual trust and elevates the risk of miscalculation, he explained",
      " Wang pointed out that the pressing need now is for all to put the larger interest embodied in the purposes and principles of the UN Charter above one's own lesser interest, and work together to oppose Cold War mentality and resist confrontation between blocs",
      " For a safer world, the key role of development must be harnessed, Wang stressed",
      " Noting that the world should not be a place where the rich stay rich while the poor remain poor, he called for stepped-up efforts to implement the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development",
      " The legitimate right to development of all countries, especially developing countries, should be effectively protected, and assistance should be extended to underdeveloped regions to improve people's lives, revitalize the economy, address both symptoms and root causes, and remove the breeding ground for conflict, he said",
      " The world should not veer off onto the wrong path of protectionism and decoupling, Wang said, noting that attempts to politicize, weaponize and draw ideological lines in the cooperation on trade, science and technology must be firmly resisted",
      " If security is to be firmly established and ensured, people in all countries should get to lead a better life, he added",
      " Some 150 senior officials, including over 40 heads of state and government, and leaders of international organizations joined this year's MSC to discuss pressing global security challenges and concerns",

      "(Photo: Xinhua)China's coordinated development of Beijing, North China's Tianjin Municipality and Hebei Province - a regional city cluster called Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, with its conveniently shortened form \"Jing-Jin-Ji\" - witnessed its ninth anniversary on Sunday",
      "Over the nine years, remarkable achievements have been made in the key fields of industrial upgrading, traffic management and environmental protection, bringing the region's total GDP to 10 trillion yuan ($1",
      "44 trillion) in 2022, up 1",
      "8 times compared with the figure in 2013",
      "In February 2014, China initiated a key strategy to coordinate the development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei to create a model with a better economic structure, cleaner environment and improved public services",
      "A prominent task of the strategy is to move non-capital functions out of Beijing to treat \"urban ills\" such as traffic jams and pollution in the Chinese capital",
      " Approximately 3,000 manufacturing and polluting enterprises in Beijing have been shut down, and nearly 1,000 markets and logistics centers have been relocated since 2014, according to data released by the Beijing Municipal Commission of Development Reform on Thursday",
      "Beijing's Zhongguancun, also known as China's Silicon Valley, is an important source of technological innovation in the Jing-Jin-Ji region",
      " To date, enterprises based in Zhongguancun have set up more than 9,500 branches in Tianjin and Hebei",
      " The total turnover of Beijing's technology contracts flowing to the two localities exceeded 210 billion yuan as of 2022, shows data from the commission",
      "Transportation development has been a basis for the coordinated development of the Jing-Jin-Ji region",

      "Tianjin municipal government vowed in a meeting on Saturday that it will convert the strategic advantage of coordinated development of the Jing-Jin-Ji region along with Tianjin's advantages in industry, technologies and ports to sustainable momentum of Tianjin's high-quality development",
      "Model of urban developmentIn order to further relieve Beijing's non-essential role and advance the coordinated development of the Jingjingji region, Beijing's two \"wings\" - the city's two sub-centers in the eastern Tongzhou district and in Xiongan New Area to the southern end of Beijing - are taking shape",
      "Dubbed China's youngest city and \"city of the future,\" Xiongan is designed to become a zone for innovation, a digital city synchronized with a brick-and-mortar counterpart, and be a livable and business-friendly area",
      "Currently, construction of the new area is forging ahead at full throttle, and centrally administered state-owned enterprises have set up more than 140 institutions there",
      "\"I participated in the construction of Xiongan since the very beginning",
      " I'm proud to say that I have witnessed the clusters of buildings rise from the ground, groups of enterprises set up businesses and cutting-edge technologies can be seen everywhere,\" Yang Ming, head of China Mobile IoT Company Ltd's business in Xiongan, told the Global Times",

      " Each following project is ensured to have the same level of high-quality of the prototype room,\" Wang said",

      "By taking the opportunity of the high-quality integrated development of Beijing's Tongzhou district, and Sanhe, Dachang and Xianghe in Hebei, authorities should actively explore a path toward coordination in areas like city planning, public services and the business environment to build a new example for regional development in the new era, said Chen on Sunday",

      " US economy Illustration: Liu Rui/GTChina released a report on the truth and facts behind the growing economic polarization in the US, revealing that the problem is so prominent that 1 percent of US households hold more than 20 percent of national household wealth",
      " The problem has been exacerbated by COVID-19 and other factors, and continues to pull at the fabric of US society",
      "The report, Rising Economic Polarization in the US: Truth and Facts, was published by the Xinhua News Agency on Thursday, highlighting some striking facts behind the US' widening wealth gap",
      " According to World Bank, the Gini coefficient, which measures inequality in income distribution, in the US has gone up from 0",
      "353 in 1974 to 0",
      "415 in 2019, exceeding the warning level of 0",
      "4, which indicates a large income gap",
      "The problem was further exacerbated by the onslaught of COVID-19, when economic recession led to massive job losses and further deterioration in the economic situation of low-income earners",
      " At the same time, excessive money supply and large-scale fiscal spending have driven up stock and housing prices, bringing enormous benefits to wealthier asset owners",
      "The Xinhua report cited a Fed report on household wealth, saying the total wealth of the richest 1 percent reached a record $45",
      "9 trillion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, and their fortunes increased by more than $12 trillion, or more than a third, during the course of the pandemic",
      "The widening wealth gap has also led to the middle class shrinking",
      " Fortune magazine reported in November 2022 that 61 percent of US adults were considered middle class in 1971, a figure that dropped to just 50 percent in 2021, according to an analysis from Pew Research Center",
      " Fewer Americans consider themselves to be middle class than before the Great Recession",
      "The shrinking of the middle class has also led to tense relations between different races in the US, as the middle class, which is mostly made up of white Americans, believe other races' improvement is based on sacrifices made by white Americans, thus fuelling their anger, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times",
      "The problem has led to growing populism in the US, created antagonism between different race groups and thus given a platform to extreme politicians who advocate a toxic form of populism, and led to an increase in cases of extreme violence, according to Li",
      "The report from Xinhua also pointed out that the widening wealth gap is one of the main causes of the deepening social crisis in the US",
      " Problems including growing ethnic conflicts, increasing homelessness, urban riots and violent crimes are all closely related to it",
      "Due to the increasing polarization between rich and poor, the US has witnessed frequent demonstrations in recent years",
      " From the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011 to the Black Lives Matter protests against police violence in the US in 2020, some demonstrations have even turned violent",
      "According to the US Census Bureau, 82 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds from high-income families have gone to college, compared with just 45 percent of those from low-income families",
      " A report by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development showed that more than 580,000 people were homeless in 2020, with 226,000 sleeping outside, in cars or in abandoned buildings",
      "Despite facing such a dire situation, US politicians are doing very little to change their people's lives",
      " Partisan conflict and constant changes in government have led to flip-flops in US policies",
      "While tax policy plays an important role in narrowing down the wealth gap, the rivalry between Democrats and Republicans on taxation has resulted in a failure to effectively tax the rich, who have tried every possible mean to \"legally\" avoid paying their dues",
      "According to a report by the news outlet ProPublica, the true tax rate of the richest Americans is only 3",
      "4 percent, far lower than that of ordinary wage earners",
      "In general, the US is facing a \"blackout\" of its national identity, its economy is being hollowed out, its society thrown into chaos, and politics is going to extremes, said Li, noting that COVID-19 has also fueled the American crisis",
      "What makes the situation worse is that the hostility between the two main parties has grown sharper, and this antagonism will exist on the US political map for the long term, which means the crisis in the country will only be further exacerbated, and it will be very difficult for the country to go back to normal, said Li",

      "As one of the most significant G20 meetings, the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting is taking place a few days after a gathering of finance ministers and central bank governors of the G20 member countries in Bengaluru failed to issue a joint statement due to the US-led West's escalation of tensions with Russia, which also cast a shadow over such multilateral economic cooperation dialogue that should aim to solve urgent issues such as debt problems and climate change, and also facilitate post-pandemic recovery",

      "China highly values China-India relations, and we believe that maintaining a good relationship between China and India - two civilizations each with a population of over 1 billion people, neighbors and emerging economies - is in the fundamental interests of the two countries and their peoples, Mao said on Wednesday at the press briefing",

      "It sparked discussions on whether Chinese cities will have an influenza outbreak surpassing that of previous years and whether there will be a duplex of COVID-19 and influenza",
      "Influenza has overtaken the novel coronavirus to become the most prevalent virus in Beijing between February 13 and 19, data released by Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control showed",
      " Meanwhile, occasional suspension of classes in schools of multiple cities including North China's Tianjin and Hangzhou in East China's Zhejiang Province were reported due to the prevalence of influenza",
      "China CDC Weekly report on influenza on February 23 showed the positive rate of influenza in the country continued to rise compared to that of last week",
      " The influenza A (H1N1) type takes up 71 percent of the total samples of the influenza, ranking the highest percentage, data showed",
      "\"It's no surprising to see the prevalence of influenza in this season, especially when nowadays the relative loosening requirements for wearing masks in public places provide a ground for prevalence of influenza,\" Wang Guangfa, a respiratory expert from Peking University First Hospital, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "In the past three years, influenza was in a low prevalence state because of COVID-19 prevention and control measures",
      " Comparing with previous years in the same period, the prevalent intensity this year also is in its low level, Wang continued",
      "Zhou Yishan, a pediatrician from Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Shunyi, has been busy with handing influenza-related cases in past days",
      " Zhou told Life Week thatthough there was a small rise in his department, but it is merely sporadic",
      "Factors including relaxed COVID-19 prevention and control measures and rapid movement of people from southern part and northern part of the country, as well as the reopening of schools were the major reasons behind for the sporadic spread, Zhou noted",
      "Besides of the prevalence of influenza, multiple disease prevention and control authorities had warned that the acute infectious diarrhea caused by norovirus has also entered its peak",
      "The period from October to March is a common season for norovirus",
      " Since there is no vaccines to help people to guard against the virus, people should be hygienic to prevent getting infected with the norovirus, Wang Guiqiang from Peking University First Hospital told Chinese media recently",
      "Wang Guangfa reminded medical institutions not to misjudge the disease whether is influenza or COVID-19 infection or just pure cold, because of its similar onset symptoms, such as fever and soar throat",
      "Influenza overtaking the novel coronavirus also confirms a fact that China has generally formed immunity against COVID-19 and the country has stepped out of COVID-19 shadow",
      " So, in the current season the possibility of a duplex of influenza and COVID-19 is quite low, Wang Guangfa noted",
      "But in winter, the possibility for the virus duplex will get higher",
      " The antibody against COVID-19 on most people will get weaker after six months and winter is a high season for influenza prevalence, Wang Guangfa explained",

      " NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg speaks during a conversation at Chey Institute in Seoul on January 30, 2023",
      " Photo: AFPNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg started his visit to South Korea and Japan on Sunday, but the \"gifts\" he brings with him aren't good",
      " During his trip to South Korea, he mainly discussed issues related to North Korea",
      " He said that the visit demonstrated \"the increased importance of the partnership between NATO and the Republic of Korea",
      "\" He also mentioned that NATO and South Korea can share information with each other in response to doubts caused by North Korea's nuclear and missile program",
      " Besides, Stoltenberg further touted about the importance of nuclear deterrence before his trip, claiming if \"China, Russia and North Korea have nuclear weapons, but NATO allies do not - that's a more dangerous world",
      "\"Obviously, Stoltenberg eyed wider",
      " NATO's existing nuclear sharing mechanism has nothing to do with the security issues on the Korean Peninsula",
      " It has to bring China and Russia along so that its appearance on the Korean Peninsula will not seem that abrupt and will not arouse the South Korea's vigilance",
      " Stoltenberg cited \"nuclear threat\" from China, Russia, and North Korea to strengthen information sharing with South Korea",
      " His purpose is very clear, that is, to draw South Korea into the cooperation framework of NATO",
      " Nuclear sharing is just an excuse with which NATO's grip can be extended to Northeast Asia in an imposing manner",
      "Although on the highly sensitive issue of nuclear sharing, Stoltenberg reserved some leeway in his public statements, the outside world generally believes that the \"information sharing\" he proposed will not be the end of NATO's involvement in the Asia-Pacific",
      " Some analyses from South Korea pointed out that NATO's move is intended to echo the US and expand its activity area to the \"Indo-Pacific\" region to contain China",
      " Although NATO claims that its positioning as a regional defensive alliance has not changed, since last year, it has continued to break traditional defense zones and areas and greatly strengthened military and security ties with Asia-Pacific countries such as Japan and South Korea",
      " Now Stoltenberg is standing on the soil of Northeast Asia, talking about \"nuclear deterrence\" in such a high-profile manner, which highlights the serious threat NATO poses to this region",
      "The stalemate on the Korean Peninsula and NATO are two remnants of the Cold War in Eurasia, but the former is a victim of the Cold War, while the latter is a beneficiary",
      " After the end of the Cold War, NATO lost the necessity and legitimacy of existence, but it survived by sucking the tense and terrifying atmosphere caused by new crises and conflicts",
      " The reason why NATO has set its sights on the Korean Peninsula is just like hyenas staring at the bleeding wounds of other animals",
      " What it brings to Northeast Asia is the drumbeat of a new cold war",
      "It is very popular in the US and the West to use the Ukraine crisis as a \"security textbook\" to sell security fears everywhere, and Stoltenberg's trip is no exception",
      " However, what happened on the European continent just shows that once there is a security dilemma, even allies will turn against each other, and this knot will become tighter and tighter",
      " In fact, this has a similar underlying logic to the situation on the Korean Peninsula",
      " The North and the South used to \"arm themselves\" out of their respective security concerns, which in turn deepened the other side's concerns",
      " What has happened on the peninsula in recent years has already proved that hostility and confrontation can never be the messengers of peace",
      " This is crystal clear",
      "We have noticed that although Stoltenberg always \"intentionally or unintentionally\" mentioned China when he unilaterally talked about the \"threat\" from North Korea, the South Korean side seemed to be relatively low-key about it",
      " In Stoltenberg's meeting with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, as well as with the defense and foreign ministers, the South Korean side avoided talking about China as much as possible",
      " This shows that South Korea's security concerns so far are still mainly focused on the peninsula issue, but South Koreans need to take more precautions against the calculative NATO",
      " The accelerated extension of NATO from Europe to Northeast Asia will only make the situation on the peninsula more complicated and difficult to resolve, and the result is by no means what South Korea wants to see",
      "South Korea's national stability and economic development today are inseparable from the long-term relative peace and stability on the peninsula",
      " The Hankyoreh pointed out soberly in a commentary, \"NATO's nuclear sharing is not about owning or sharing usage rights to nuclear weapons, but a means of sharing the political burden and operational risks",
      "\" The \"nuclear bait\" brought about by NATO is definitely poison rather than a cure for South Korea, which pursues a safe and stable external environment",
      " Today, NATO's intention to get involved in the Asia-Pacific is well known",
      " How to refuse to \"drink poison to quench thirst\" will test Seoul's political wisdom",

      " Human Rights Day is observed every year on Dec",
      " 10 - the day the United Nations General Assembly adopted in 1948 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights",
      " (Photo by Tshekiso Tebalo/Xinhua)During the 38th session of the China-EU Human Rights Dialogue held in Brussels local time on Friday, which marked a resumption of the talks after a suspension since 2019, China urged the EU to view the development of China's human rights cause in an objective way, cease politicizing human rights issues with double standard practices, and respect China's sovereignty and core interests",
      "Chinese observers believe that such resumption, coming after bilateral ties became icy since March 2021, is of great necessity and will serve as an effective measure to rectify the malicious trend of politicizing human rights-related issues, the practices of double standards, and the use of human rights as a tool for rivalry",
      "According to an official press release of the event, the dialogue was co-chaired by Sun Lei, Deputy Director General for International Organizations and Conferences at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Paola Pampaloni, Deputy Managing Director for Asia and the Pacific in the European External Action Service",
      "Sun stressed that matters related to China's Xinjiang and Xizang (Tibet) regions and affairs related to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, should not be categorized as human rights issues, instead they are major issues of principle that are related to China's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, with no external interference allowed",
      "The EU is requested during dialogue to pay serious attention to China's concerns, and be cautious in words and deeds on issues involving China's core interests and major concerns, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry",
      "China also shared its vision of human rights which is people-centered and views that the rights of survival and development are prioritized as basic human rights",
      " The country pointed out that the EU should take note of its own human rights problems such as violations of the rights of refugees and immigrants, an increase in exclusiveness and racism, as well as the application of unilateral coercive measures that violate human rights in other countries and double standards in matters including freedom of the press and forced labor",
      "The two sides welcomed the in-depth and candid discussion despite their divergences",
      " However, such differences should not be politicalized, and the two sides should continue dialogues to enhance understanding and handle differences with constructive measures",
      " The two sides agreed to collaborate on safeguarding the rights of women and children, per the Chinese Foreign Ministry release",
      "\"The reopening of the talks is of great necessity",
      " Such talks would be effective in correcting the US-led Western malicious trend of politicizing human rights-related issues, the practices of double standards, and the use of human rights as a tool for competition,\" Chang Jian, a professor and director of the Center for the Study of Human Rights at Nankai University, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "Tang Yingxia, vice director of the research center for human rights at Nankai University, told the Global Times that it also shows China's confidence and openness on human rights related issues",
      "Tang has just participated in the third review of China's implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) in Geneva and she was part of China's high-level delegation representing NGOs where she had a faceoff with Western rights groups",
      "Those rights groups are trumpeting their values that promote human rights, democracy and freedom while neglecting other countries' progress made in the field and efforts made toward such progress, Tang said, adding that they use hearsay and false information to accuse and contain China",
      "The China-EU Human Rights Dialogue that started in 1997 and was held twice a year has been stalled since a session in April 2019, following EU's sanctions and China's countermeasures over human rights issues",
      " The decision to resume the dialogue was taken at the China-EU Summit in April 2022",
      "Although the EU's foreign affairs spokesperson, Nabila Massrali, told media that the EU and China have different views on human rights, she said this is exactly why the dialogue is important",
      " Some rights groups in Europe slammed the talks, labeling them \"meaningless,\" as they advocate more sanctions against China and Chinese individuals rather than talks",
      "Chinese observers push back at such views, stressing that to yield positive fruits from these talks, it is crucial to be sincere and humble in the first place, so that both sides can learn from each other and enhance understanding of the reasons behind their divergences",
      " China has displayed sincerity in the exchanges",
      "Wang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission, met with EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell Fontelles on Saturday while attending the Munich Security Conference, stressing that China and the EU are not rivals but partners, and share more areas of agreement than points of divergence",
      "Chang warned the EU and US-led West that human rights issues should be a bridge rather than a barrier",
      " If one side is trying to forcibly coerce its own understanding and practices onto others, human rights issues shall inevitably become a barrier for restoring ties",

      "Chinese analysts believe that against the backdrop of visits and upcoming visits to China by European leaders, the relations between China and Europe are likely to be further enhanced, which goes against the US' expectation",
      " So Washington is hyping the \"Chinese military backing for Russia\" based on inference of guilt in an attempt to drive the wedge between Beijing and Brussels, but it is doomed to fail, analysts said",
      "According to the Politico, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday said China had declared it won't supply Russia with weapons, suggesting that \"Berlin has received bilateral assurances from Beijing on the issue",
      "\"Scholz was speaking at a press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who told reporters that the EU has received \"no evidence\" so far from the US that Beijing is considering supplying lethal support to Moscow, the Politico reported",
      "Groundless rumors of \"Chinese military backing for Russia\" have swirled around since late February when White House national security adviser Jack Sullivan told CNN that China aiding Russia would be \"a bad mistake\" and CIA Director Bill Burns expressed confidence with the CBS News that China \"is considering the provision of lethal equipment\" to Russia",
      "But Both Sullivan and Burns admitted that there's no evidence of actual shipments of lethal equipment from China to Russia",

      " Also, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel may visit China in the first half of 2023 with preparations already underway, Chinese Ambassador to the EU Fu Cong told the Global Times in an exclusive interview previously",
      "Gao told the Global Times on Monday that it is in line with common sense and based on matter-of-fact attitude for Europe to adopt such a position that does not blindly follow the US in response to the \"Chinese arms aid\" rumors",
      "During the yearlong Russia-Ukraine conflict, Europe is one of the most direct victims of the crisis while the US has been the biggest beneficiary who is on the way to hollow out Europe economically, militarily and on energy, Gao said",
      "So Europe has learnt that the US cannot be counted on to truly resolve the Ukraine crisis",
      " In this sense, more European leaders have revealed their potential visits to China and hope that China can play a positive role in promoting peace talks in the conflict, analysts said",
      "However, although the Europe is rethinking the future of its relationship with China and with the US and trying to strengthen its diplomatic independence, it is still facing a very severe test, as the pressure from the US and within Europe is mounting, analysts said, noting that there are still some divergences on issues of diplomatic strategy on China within the Europe",

      " Manila should avoid being used as a pawn of countries outside the region in following their agenda of militarizing the region and jeopardizing the hard-won peace and stability in the South China Sea, Song noted",
      "Marcos' Japan visit also comes shortly before new rounds of negotiations over a code of conduct (COC) with ASEAN members and China over disputed waters in the South China Sea that are scheduled to be held from March",
      "Chinese analysts pointed out that the main goal of agreeing on the COC is to exclude non-regional actors from South China Sea-related discussions, and it is due to interference from outside countries that the COC has encountered grave challenges in being concluded for years, which makes the goals of building the South China Sea into a sea of \"peace, friendship and cooperation\" difficult to achieve",
      "Marcos Jr said in January that his administration intends to pursue an independent foreign policy after his visit to China where he received a high-level welcome and scored cooperation deals in a range of social and economic sectors",
      "\"Marcos Jr is clearly making adjustments in his country's relations with China and the US, and he is betting on both sides",
      " And different from the former president, Rodrigo Duterte, he might be more inclined toward the US, as being proven in recent moves,\" said Gu Xiaosong, dean of the ASEAN Research Institute of Hainan Tropical Ocean University",
      "However, this course is detrimental to the peace and stability in the South China Sea, as the US deployment of troops, warships and warplanes to the region poses threats to not only China but to the whole region, Gu warned",
      "\"Marcos should see how the good China ties of the past six years under the the Duterte administration have contributed greatly to the overall stability and peace in the region, and the importance of keeping external countries outside the South China Sea,\" Gu said",

      " Illustration: Liu Rui/GTThe provocative arms sale to China's Taiwan region will make it more difficult to restore China-US military cooperation and exchanges, Chinese experts warned Tuesday, following reports that Washington has proposed arms sale to the secessionist Taiwan authorities, less than a month after two heads of state met face-to face in Bali, when US President Joe Biden reaffirmed that the US does not support \"Taiwan independence,\" and has no intention to engage in conflict with China",
      "Given the absolute military advantage of the Chinese mainland over Taiwan island, the US arms sales to Taiwan would be more about political provocation than a military support in practice, experts said",
      " They also urged the US to be true to its words and deeds, take concrete actions to stop provocations against China's core interests on the Taiwan question and refrain from sending wrong signals to Taiwan secessionists after their fiasco in the recent local elections",
      "According to a US State Department notice obtained by Bloomberg, the Biden administration has proposed selling Taiwan as many as 100 of its most advanced Patriot air-defense missiles, as well as radar and support equipment in a deal valued $882 million",
      "The proposal, according to Bloomberg, was made under the provisions of an Obama administration 2010 $2",
      "81 billion arms sale to the island of Taiwan and therefore \"technically is not new",
      "\" The US media mentioned that the 2010 package \"infuriated Beijing\" at the time and led it to halt military exchanges",
      "The notice to US lawmakers is expected to be printed in the Congressional Record as soon as Tuesday and will be reviewed by Congress for up to 30 days, according to Bloomberg",
      "The latest US military sales to Taiwan under the Biden administration was approved by the US State Department on September 2, a potential $1",
      "1 billion package including $355 million for Harpoon air-to-sea missiles and $85 million for Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, according to US media reports",
      " The package was approved after the outgoing US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reckless visit to Taiwan island where she met with secessionists in August",
      "China announced eight countermeasures in response to Pelosi's highly provocative tour, including halting China-US theater commanders talk, defense policy coordination talks, military maritime security consultative mechanism and suspending cooperation on illegal immigration repatriation, drug control and climate change",
      "Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the US says it supports the one-China policy, but its action is to pull Taiwan away from China",
      "US arms sale would be easily interpreted by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as a signal of support from the US for \"seeking independence\" and a blow to Taiwan compatriots' efforts to strengthen ties with the mainland, especially after the secessionists DPP's fiasco in the local elections, Li said",
      "The US arms sale to Taiwan tramples on one of the cornerstones of the stability of the China-US relations and current international relations, namely the one-China principle, Li said",
      "Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that arms sales to Taiwan could hinder the resumption of the halted military and other exchanges between China and the US",
      "In November, some analysts were optimistic that China and US could resume exchanges in the military and other aspects that were halted due to Pelosi's irresponsible moves after the first face-to-face meeting between the leaders of the world's two biggest economies since Biden took office at the G20 Summit in November",
      " During the meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed that the Taiwan question is at the very core of China's core interests, the bedrock of the political foundation of China-US relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations",
      " Biden said at the meeting that the US does not support \"Taiwan independence,\" does not support \"two Chinas\" or \"one China, one Taiwan",
      "\"The US should take more substantive measures to stop provocations on the Taiwan question and convince China that it is sincere in improving China-US relations, rather than saying one thing and doing another, Xin said",
      " \"Disclosing the arms sale at this point seems like saying that it will not give up playing the 'Taiwan card' to contain China and hinder China's reunification",
      "\"It cannot be ruled out that there are some extreme ideological conservative anti-China forces in the US, who are trying to block the momentum of the recent sound development of China-US relations, including the consensus reached between the two leaders in the G20, Li said",
      "But no matter what happens inside the US, arms sales to Taiwan mean damage to China's core interests and interference in China's internal affairs, and China needs to give the US a serious warning over it, Li added",
      " \"If arms sales do happen, China will not do nothing",

      " Photo: XinhuaLittle military significanceThe US' arm sales to Taiwan in recent years have become increasingly aggressive with more powerful equipment",
      " However, the 100 Patriot air defense missiles will not help the island of Taiwan gain a military edge over the Chinese mainland, as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) can launch saturation attacks including those with hypersonic missiles and stealth aircraft that would completely overwhelm the island's air defense, said Chinese mainland analysts",
      "According to Bloomberg, some 100 missiles of the hit-to-kill PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement are planned to be delivered to the island of Taiwan",
      " This version of the Patriot missile allegedly has increased range and covers higher altitude against tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and warplanes thanks to the use of a dual pulse rocket engine and modified aerodynamic design, a Chinese mainland military expert told the Global Times on Tuesday, requesting anonymity",
      "But it will have no chance against the PLA's hypersonic missiles which no current air defense system is capable of intercepting; stealth-capable cruise missiles and warplanes can also destroy the installations undetected, creating openings for additional attacks, the expert said",
      "The PLA Rocket Force operates the DF-17 short-to-medium range hypersonic missile, and the PLA Air Force just displayed a type of air-launched ballistic missile also believed to be hypersonic at Airshow China 2022, carried by the H-6K bomber",
      "Aircraft like the J-20 fighter jet and the GJ-11 drone are stealth-capable, and a type of stealth cruise missile was carried by the J-16 fighter jet and the JH-7A fighter bomber displayed at Airshow China",
      "The PLA can also simply pour a large number of munitions into saturation attacks, including inexpensive long-range rockets, which will outnumber the island of Taiwan's air defense missiles, the expert said",

      " If the procedures go well, Ya Ya will return home earlier, according to the source close to CAZG",
      " In April of 2003, Ya Ya from Beijing Zoo and Le Le from Shanghai Zoo arrived at the Memphis Zoo in the US state of Tennessee as a part of a joint conservation and research project between CAZG and the US zoo with an agreement duration of 10 years which was extended by 10 more years in 2013",
      " The arrival of the pair of pandas made the Memphis Zoo the fourth zoo in the US to have pandas on exhibition",

      "Chinese modernization contains elements that are common to the modernization processes of all countries, but it is more characterized by features that are unique to the fine traditional Chinese culture and the Chinese context, according to the spokesperson",

      " Photo: VCGOn Friday, the Russia-Ukraine military conflict dragged on to its one year mark with no positive sign of a truce in sight",
      " With the conflict not only profoundly changing geopolitics in the European continent and the world, but also redefining countries' notions on security, the majority of the international community is calling on all parties to press the stop button and urging some countries to stop adding fuel to the fire before a heavier impact is brought to the global economy and development",
      "Calling the past year one of \"sorrow, faith and unity,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on Telegram on Friday that this will be a year of \"victory,\" implying that the conflict will continue",
      " No delivery of message was reported from Russian President Vladimir Putin as of press time on Friday, but his remarks to the Federal Assembly on Tuesday that \"Russia cannot be defeated on the battlefield\" also showed Russia's decision to follow through with its military operation",
      "Reactions from different parties varied on the one-year anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " On Friday, the US-led NATO, which bears the initial responsibility for inciting the confrontation, issued a statement restating its support for Ukraine; the US, following President Joe Biden's whirlwind trip to Ukraine, planned to transport more weapons to the battlefield, and announced a new range of sanctions against Russia; and the European Union reaffirmed its backing for Ukraine but will have to swallow more bitter pills",
      " More forces around the world are calling for a truce",
      " At its resumed 11th emergency special session, the UN General Assembly adopted a new resolution calling for an end to the war, only hours before the conflict enters its second year on Friday",
      " Also on Friday, China issued a 12-point position paper and called for a cessation of hostilities and resumption of peace talks, and an end to unilateral sanctions and Cold War mentality",
      "The Russia-Ukraine conflict has changed the world, with more people feeling that war is not far away from their daily lives and countries reconsidering their notion of traditional security, especially in the military field, Wang Chenxing, a research fellow on national security from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), told the Global Times",

      "By inciting the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, the US has succeeded in estranging Russia from Europe at the same time realizing its ambition to replicate the mess in other regions to compete with its rival",

      "While the world continues to bear the brunt, observers pointed out that how the global economy navigates these crises this year is highly dependent on how the two sides settle the dispute",
      "Last year, natural gas and electricity prices skyrocketed to a record high in Europe, after Brussels, along with other Western countries, jointly slapped rounds of sanctions on Russia's energy imports, prompting countermeasures from Russia",
      " The sanctions have backfired on the European economy, whose manufacturing has been running on fumes as they were mainly powered by Russian imports",

      " A local farmer in Hungary told the Global Times that before the arrival of winter last year, his family had to chop wood in advance and use the stockpiles as an alternative heating source, or he would face bankruptcy over Christmas",
      "Rising production costs have also reportedly prompted a raft of European companies, including German automaker BMW and Arcelor Mittal, one of the world's largest steelmakers, to consider relocating their manufacturing lines to other bases, such as the US, fueling de-industrialization fears in Europe and further shattering the global supply chain",
      "The rest of the world was also caught in the crossfire of the ever-expanding crisis, in particular a number of debt-ridden emerging economies such as Sri Lanka",
      " According to data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, up to 205 million people in 45 countries and regions are expected to face acute food insecurity and will be in need of urgent assistance from October 2022 to January 2023",

      "Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Friday that while the emergency situation will ease in 2023, the lingering conflict will still create uncertainties which will likely continue weighing on global economic prospects",
      " \"The extent of the consequences hangs on whether Russia and Ukraine head toward a solution,\" Cui said",
      "Analysts warned that in the short-term, the disarray in global supply chains won't see any sign of reversing, which could further dent the economic outlook in particular in Europe",
      " The EU bloc has been ramping up efforts to reduce its reliance on Russian natural gas, replacing it with imports from countries like the US, Canada, Algeria while also gearing up for a renewable energy push",
      "Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times that energy supply will remain tight this year in Europe despite a recent drop in prices",
      " \"It takes a certain amount of time for Europe to build basic infrastructure for energy transportation, and this means energy prices won't return to normal in the short term,\" Lin said",
      "But one thing remains certain this year - the US will continue the playbook last year, pocketing revenues from the crisis, at the cost of the interests of the rest of the world, especially that of its ally Europe, analysts said",
      "\"From a strategic view, the US is the outright biggest winner of the crisis",
      " In the past, US LNG lacked competitiveness in the European market, but it has 'wedged into the space' by pressuring Europe to follow its sanctions against Russia,\" Lin explained",
      "With no signs of peace talks in sight, analysts predicted that the Russia-Ukraine conflict may last for months and further affect global development",
      " As no country is isolated from the rest of the world, the US will also suffer the bitterness brought by war, analysts said",

      " Elliott, which acquired around $170 million of Argentine government bonds for much less than their original value, demanded a full repayment of more than $1",
      "5 billion",
      " Negotiations between Elliott and the Argentine government eventually broke down",

      "As Joseph E",
      " Stiglitz, a professor of economics at Columbia University, said, \"We've had a lot of bombs being thrown around the world, and this is America throwing a bomb into the global economic system",
      "\"The Elliott hedge fund and its sort have earned themselves the title of \"vultures,\" and are lashed out by developing countries as \"unscrupulous financiers",

      "Zambia's Ministry of Finance says Western commercial creditor debt accounts for 46 percent of its foreign debt",
      " As of April 2021, Sri Lanka's total foreign debt was nearly $35 billion, of which about 50 percent came from Europe and the US , according to a report by the Radio France Internationale",
      "Western commercial creditors charge higher, and mostly floating interest rates",
      " According to the African Development Bank, the interest rates of 10-year government bonds of African countries dominated by the West range from 4 percent to 10 percent",
      " In comparison, as revealed by Debt Justice, the average interest rate on China's official and commercial loans to Africa is 2",
      "7 percent, which is far below those of Western countries",
      "The Fed's repeated interest rate hikes and the rapid strengthening of the US dollar have led to an increase in the cost of debt servicing for dollar-denominated bonds, putting enormous pressure on developing countries to repay their debts",
      " In addition, as high interest rates attract large amounts of dollars back to the US, developing countries have seen their currencies depreciate, further increasing their debt service costs",
      "A Zambian-born American economist, Dambisa Moyo, argues that instead of changing the lives of African people, the dominant, condescending attitude of Western countries toward aid to Africa has left African societies in a status quo of almost no development, and has instead left African countries deep in the trap of dependence on foreign aid",
      "Indeed, Western countries' financing to Africa is mainly concentrated in non-productive areas, and most of the loans include political preconditions such as human rights or judicial reform",
      " Unfortunately, such financing programs do not really promote economic development, increase government tax revenue, or improve the balance of payments",
      "Also, Western commercial creditors and multilateral institutions, which account for the largest share of claims, have consistently refused to participate in relevant debt relief actions under the pretext of maintaining their own credit ratings",

      "The cadets who pass the selection criteria, which will test the candidates' physical and mental qualities and flying talent, will have a chance to become China's first female carrier-based aircraft pilots",

      " A crowd of activists march along Whitehall during The Public and Commercial Services Union strike in London on February 2",
      " Photo: VCGThe UK is being shaken by the biggest wave of strikes in more than a decade, with as many as half a million workers' discontent over pay and working conditions finally erupting after brewing for months",
      " Meanwhile, widespread protests are also taking place on the other side of the English Channel, where protesters in France demonstrated their anger over President Emmanuel Macron's plans to raise the retirement age",
      "While a range of reasons, such as untamed inflation and deteriorating living conditions, are behind the rare strike in the UK, Chinese observers pointed out that Brexit, turmoil within political parties, and lack of strong leadership to bring the country back on track are what have put the UK in its current quandary",
      "Moreover, declining competitiveness and market share have left the UK feeling the pinch of deglobalization promoted by its close ally the US, while the Russia-Ukraine crisis has added insult to Europe's injury",
      " With economic recovery widely anticipated in 2023, experts urged the UK and other European countries to ride this wave and stop acting as Washington's vassals, and instead expand rational, win-win cooperation with countries such as China for their own benefits",
      "In the UK, teachers, university staff, train drivers and civil servants - including staff checking passports at airports - are striking in large numbers over pay and working conditions, as living standards continue to plunge after years of below-inflation raises, CNN reported on Wednesday",
      "The escalating strike action comes just weeks after the government tried to resolve pay disputes to bring an end to the worst wave of industrial unrest the country has seen in decades",
      " Many public sector workers have been offered raises of 4-5 percent for the current financial year, with the annual rate of inflation running at 10",
      "5 percent",
      "Such widespread strike action has not taken place since a dispute over public sector pay in 2011",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron's plan to raise the retirement age to 64 also prompted more than 1",
      "27 million people to take part in street demonstrations across France, the Guardian reported",
      "The French government has argued that the changes are crucial to guaranteeing the future financing of the pension system, which is forecast to tip into deficit in the next few years",
      "Although the direct causes of UK and France's protests are different, they show that financial problems are eating deeply into Europe, said experts, noting that the situation may be more challenging for the UK",
      "Ever since it left the European Union, and with the Russia-Ukraine crisis adding insult to injury, the UK's social and economic development has hit huge buffers, with inflation hitting a 41-year-high in the latter half of this year, Gao Jian, director of the Center for British Studies at Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "The UK is still in a head-spinning situation after its painful departure from the European Union, and is closely following the US in cracking down on China and fanning the flames between Russia and Ukraine, Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times, noting that none of those attempts has saved the UK from post-Brexit chaos",
      "The IMF's new 2023 forecast on Monday evening saw the UK as the only \"advanced economy\" to contract, by 0",
      "6 percent",
      " This is 0",
      "9 percentage points lower than its previous estimate",
      "With positive forecasts for the global economy widely anticipated this year, the UK and Europe should jump on the trend, discard the US-imposed unilateralist mentality, and seek win-win cooperation with countries such as China, while also contributing more to easing tensions between Russia and Ukraine, rather than fanning the flames, said experts",
      "Last month, the US and other NATO countries said they will ship a huge, wide-ranging package of heavy weapons to Ukraine, sending a clear signal that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is expected to escalate in the coming months",
      "Wang predicted that the UK and other European countries will become mired in the wave of strikes for the whole year, but the situation will be improved if the Russia-Ukraine crisis eases this year",
      " \"Also, major economies such as China and India may contribute to global economic prospects this year, so in the best case scenario, economic stagnation in Europe is expected to ease in the latter half of this year,\" Wang said",

      "In November 2021, the Ministry of Education issued the Guide for Life Safety and Health Education Curriculum Teaching Materials for Primary and Secondary Schools, which requires students to \"learn the basic knowledge and skills of adolescent health care and improve their ability to prevent sexual harassment and assault",
      "\"Beijing and Shanghai released the first pilot sex education textbooks for primary schools as early as 2011",
      "But several experts have said that not only are there few kindergartens in China that provide appropriate sex education for children, but most teachers have not received proper training in sex education, and localized teaching materials are also hard to find",
      "Some experts believe sex education textbooks should not be just copied from the West",
      " These textbooks should be developed by authorities, experts on child sex education and even representatives of public opinion, Peng said, adding that these materials should be piloted and gradually improved in select kindergartens, so as to be promoted in kindergartens across the country",
      "It's alarming that some Western countries have infiltrated sex education in China and instilled some so-called politically correct ideas into the younger generation through foundations, agencies and NGOs, the expert noted, adding that this constitutes Western interference in China's social development from the commanding heights of discourse",
      "Many netizens and parents expressed similar views, saying that they encourage and support the idea of children receiving sex education, only if the content is consistent with children's cognition, social cognition and legal constraints",
      "Sex education in kindergarten can start with a simple understanding of the body, so that children can gain basic judgment and awareness of self-protection, a netizen surnamed Jian told the Global Times",
      " More specific sex education and gender knowledge should be strengthened through courses at high schools and universities, she added",
      "Another parent surnamed Yang said that sex education content must be appropriate for the age and cognitive level of children, while attention should also be paid to protecting children's privacy and safety",
      "Education should not only teach children a correct and normal understanding of sexuality, but also guide them to shape values in line with the laws and social cognition of Chinese society, Peng said",

      " Cartoon: Carlos LatuffCNN on Monday published an analysis entitled \"Why the Chinese balloon crisis could be a defining moment in the new Cold War,\" saying that \"The Chinese balloon saga threatens to be a watershed moment in the world's dangerous new superpower rivalry: For the first time, Americans experienced a tangible symbol of the national security challenge from Beijing",
      "\"A civilian Chinese airship can be sensationalized as \"a defining moment in the new Cold War,\" which illustrates how far Washington has gone in deteriorating its relations with China",
      " This is not the first time in the world that balloons for scientific research went out of control",
      " The US shooting down the airship dramatically aggravated this incident",
      " The US' move seems to show the outside world its resolute manner of confrontation with China",
      "The rhetoric of this CNN piece displays that the main driving force of exacerbating China-US relations comes from a false \"China threat\" perception constructed by the US itself, which is essentially a product of American hegemony",
      " Washington has set a standard of absolute national security, and then spread it among the American public for a long time via a set of media mechanisms, forming a false sense of security among them",
      "When there is any unexpected disturbance of external uncertainty, it will trigger a major setback",
      " It is just like a jealous and arrogant one who thinks itself as powerful, but its heart is very fragile",
      " It turns out the US is essentially a gigantic baby living in a false sense of security that it created",
      "The balloon posed no impact let alone a threat to US national security",
      " Yet due to Washington's excessive hype, the so-called China threat theory has been promoted in a radical manner",
      "Another illustration is that republican congressman Michael Waltz on Sunday published an opinion on Fox News, describing the so-called Chinese spy balloon as \"a Sputnik moment for America",
      "\"The balloon incident is a whole different story from the Sputnik satellite of the Soviet Union, and such hype and analogy are complete bollocks",
      " The Sputnik moment referred to the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite Sputnik 1 in 1957, which shocked Washington as it hoped the US would accomplish this scientific advancement first",
      " This triggered the US to considerably invest funds and sources to catch up",
      " \"Waltz's analogy between a Chinese civilian airship, which does not involve much technology, and Sputnik mirrors how ignorant, arrogant as well as vulnerable some US politicians are,\" Shen Yi, a professor at Fudan University, told the Global Times",
      "\"If there is a Sputnik moment between Beijing and Washington, the Chinese tech giant Huawei's technological advancement in 5G is more like it",
      " In response to the satellite Sputnik in 1957, Washington expanded its support for scientific research and education at an unprecedented rate, in a bid to boost US' capabilities to compete with the Soviet Union",
      " But when dealing with Huawei, the US has adopted a series of means to suppress this tech company, instead of going all out to develop its own technology",
      " It's also a sign of the US' decline,\" noted Shen",
      "As an \"after-effect,\" Washington may push some more radical matters regarding China-US relations in the future, and may use the set of approaches against the Soviet Union to deal with China",
      " The US' excessive exaggeration of the balloon incident is also an attempt to mobilize the US public to gain their understanding for the US government's use of national resources to compete with China without a bottom line",
      " The question is, does the US today have the confidence and ability to cope with China in this way?White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday that \"It's up to China to figure out what kind of relationship they want",
      "\" Such a line is to pass the buck of deterioration of China-US relations to China",

      " \"Strategic,\" as a high-frequency word throughout China-Iran cooperation, is a highly condensed expression of the connotation of the relationship between the two countries",
      "As two ancient civilizations in Asia, China and Iran are now important industrialized powers and energy producers respectively",
      " The two countries are highly complementary economically, and both have a strong desire for development",
      " The development needs of the two countries are highly compatible in many fields",
      " For many years, China has been Iran's largest trading partner; Iran is one of the most important markets for China's overseas project contracting, and exports of complete sets of equipment and technology",
      " Meanwhile, Iran is an important country in the process of China's high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative through joint efforts, and China is the target partner of Iran's \"looking east\"policy",
      " The potential for future cooperation between the two sides is huge",
      "The development of China-Iran relations has a strong endogenous driving force",
      " It can be said that President Raisi's visit to China is very natural",
      " However, as Iran is still under severe sanctions by the US, and China is the main target of US' strategic suppression",
      " With a narrow-minded mindset, some US and Western public opinion appeared rather odd in viewing the relationship between China and Iran, hyping that both China and Iran are \"opposed\" to the US and claiming that cooperation between the two sides will \"weaken US efforts to isolate Iran",
      "\" Such zero-sum thinking is arrogant, unreasonable and overbearing",
      " China and Iran do not need to act according to their attitude, and it is even less likely that the two sides will reduce exchanges because some people are unhappy",
      "In fact, many of the achievements of China-Iran cooperation in recent years have been realized by overcoming interference and sabotage by the US side",
      " It may be difficult to improve this situation in a short period of time, but outside the US-West bloc and its influence circle, there is huge space and potential for win-win cooperation between countries, including China and Iran, which cannot be blocked by the political forces of the US and the West",
      "In this sense, China's deepening cooperation with Iran also has anti-hegemony and anti-bullying feature",
      " Both China and Iran uphold independent foreign policies, firmly defend the principle of non-interference in internal affairs on international occasions, and safeguard the common interests of developing countries",
      " This is conducive to promoting the multi-polarization and diversified development of the world, and conforms to the general trend of the times",
      " If anyone feels \"targeted\" in this process, then they should first reflect on whether they are too selfish",
      "The world today is undergoing major changes unseen in a century",
      " Under Washington's moves, the international structure is being divided and restructured, with the vicious trend of forming blocs and camps again emerging, which puts the non-Western world in a difficult situation and once again faces historical choices",
      " The existing US-led international system has designs to bully and exploit developing countries and emerging countries",
      " Now Washington still thinks that it is not convenient enough, that the interests of developing countries have increased in weight, and wants to reconstruct a new international system with a stronger tendency, which is undoubtedly a major challenge for the non-Western world and needs to be resisted by forming a joint effort",
      "During the Cold War, many developing countries refused to join the bloc confrontation, and they started Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to pursue independent, autonomic and non-camp purpose and principle",
      " Today, two thirds of the UN members are members of the NAM and about 55 percent of the global population live in NAM countries",
      " This is a mainstream political force deliberately ignored by the US and Western public opinion",
      " China is a natural partner of the NAM, and it has always shared the destiny with vast number of developing countries, upheld correct concept of justice and interests and promoted global governance system in a fairer and reasonable direction",
      "Some US and Western media outlets viewed President Raisi's China visit as China and Iran \"huddling together for warmth",
      "\" Such view is not surprising to us, since it's a result of their binary opposition thinking, and also because Washington has distorted the international landscape",
      " Through a distorted mirror, all things that the US and the West see are twisted",
      " However, it must be said this underestimates China-Iran relations",
      " As an old saying goes: How can a sparrow know the will of a swan? We welcome President Raisi's visit, and look forward to China-Iran relations reaching a new high",

      " The expression is, if your only tool is a hammer, you think every problem is a nail",
      " The US basically has one giant hammer, which is our military, which we spend $1 trillion a year on and have 800 to 900 military bases around the world",
      " The US views most problems as something that can be dealt with militarily",
      "It really is the first solution that the US goes to, which is horrifying on a bunch of levels, not to mention the innocent civilians that die in any military conflict, but it's horrifying on the level that any military conflict puts us closer to nuclear war, and, even if it's accidental, an accidental nuclear exchange where the world becomes unlivable",
      " Everyone dies in a nuclear exchange, essentially",
      "So, the idea that that is the only way to solve things is just psychotic and sad and just completely uninvolved",
      " It's a very simple brained response to every problem",
      "Now, the US kind of has a second smaller hammer which we can describe as \"economic warfare,\" that we have been using a lot of recently",
      " But unfortunately, we don't use it usually to pressure countries",
      " We use it in a way that often kills a lot of people",
      " Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, have died from our economic wars on Afghanistan, Venezuela, Iran and Syria",
      " Right now, Syria is dealing with this horrible earthquake",
      " Why is the earthquake so horrible? Part of it is that they have no infrastructure and no ability to deal with a disaster like that",
      "Why is that? Well, the US has put crushing economic sanctions on Syria",
      " That doesn't mean that Syria doesn't have plenty of its own internal problems, but this crushing economic war means that 90 percent of Syrians are what the US rapporteur recently said are below the international poverty line",
      "If you have so many people who are poor in a country and they're dealing with a horrifying earthquake, they don't have the ability to deal with it",
      " And part of that is America's fault",
      "Many people talk about sanctions as if they're not a form of war; but in reality they really are a form of war",
      " And another UN rapporteur found that around 100,000 Venezuelans have died from our economic war on them, because the people who are harmed first and worst by economic war are the babies, the elderly, the ill, the very poor",
      " The rich and the upper class tend to be fine",
      " They may lose some of their money, but they tend to be fine",
      "Now as the Russia-Ukraine conflict drags on, China must have realized that the US is trying to pick off pieces of a Russian influence",
      " Ukraine is not owned by Russia, but it is a former Soviet bloc country",
      " The US has long for many years now been trying to pick away Ukraine so that Ukraine would be fully US and NATO supportive",
      " And by doing that, they then have NATO even closer onto Russia's border",
      "The US military complex is trying to do the same thing",
      " It is trying to pick off pieces of China, find pieces of China that are vulnerable, and either get them to turn against China or get them to at least be something that China has to spend a lot of effort, maybe even use its military to deal with",
      "They're trying to do it with Xinjiang",
      " They're trying to do it with Taiwan",
      " This is how the US works",
      " It will be kind of like someone going into Texas in the US and trying to get Texas to decide its own country, which by the way some Texans believe they are",
      "If someone gets Texas to declare it's a separate country and they want their independence, the US would then have to spend a lot of effort dealing with the fact that Texas wanted to be its own country",
      "It's a tactic designed to weaken what our ruling class views as the enemy",

      " The Fujian Graphic: GTIn an epitome that highlights a busy year of missions and development, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) carried out several concurrent major military exercises at the end of 2022, including the China-Russia joint naval drill, far sea training of the Liaoning aircraft carrier group and the cross-service joint exercises around the island of Taiwan, with observers expecting the PLA to continue making strides and achieve its centenary goal in 2027, safeguarding the country's sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests",
      "China and Russia on Tuesday wrapped up the weeklong Joint Sea 2022 naval exercise in the East China Sea, in which some of the PLA Navy's main combat and support surface, aerial and underwater elements joined their Russian counterparts in training courses including joint blockade, joint air defense and joint anti-submarine, according to a statement released by the PLA Navy on the day",
      "On Sunday, the PLA Eastern Theater Command conducted cross-service joint combat alert patrols and joint fire strike exercises in maritime and aerial areas around the island of Taiwan in a resolute response to the recent escalation in the US-Taiwan collusion, with the defense authority on the island reporting a record-breaking number of 71 PLA warplanes surrounding the island",
      "In the meantime, the Liaoning aircraft carrier group in its new prime - with two Type 055 10,000 ton-class large destroyers among others in the flotilla - has been operating in the West Pacific waters east of the island of Taiwan and south of Japan since December 16, hosting intensive fighter jet and helicopter takeoff and landing drills under the close watch of Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force",
      "These simultaneous drills highlighted the PLA's intensive exercises throughout the year across the country",
      "Following US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative visit to the island of Taiwan in early August, the PLA hosted large-scale military exercises that blockaded the island of Taiwan almost entirely, and saw PLA ballistic missiles fly over the island for the first time",
      "China and Russia held several other drills, including two joint aerial strategic patrols in May and November featuring strategic bombers from both sides flying over the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea and the West Pacific, the Russia-led Vostok-2022 strategic drills in eastern Russia in September, and a joint naval patrol in the Pacific Ocean following the Vostok-2022",
      "In July, China and Pakistan held the joint naval drill Sea Guardians-2 off Shanghai, with the Pakistan Navy operating its newly commissioned Type 054A/P frigate built by China",
      "The intensive and often concurrent exercise schedules reflect that the PLA has grown in both size and capability, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times",
      "These significant developments of the PLA have also benefited from China's advancements in technology, the arms industry and the country's overall economy, Song said",
      "On June 17, China launched the country's third aircraft carrier, the Fujian",
      " Having a displacement of more than 80,000 tons, the vessel is the country's first one equipped with electromagnetic catapults and arresting devices, making China a step closer to the world's top level super carriers",
      "Ten years ago, the PLA commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, which was built from an unfinished Soviet hull",
      " It is astounding to see how fast China's aircraft carrier program has progressed in these 10 years, observers said",
      "In 2022, two new Type 075 amphibious assault ships, the Guangxi and the Anhui, three new Type 055 large destroyers, the Anshan, the Wuxi and the Yan'an, and many other main surface combatants entered service with the PLA Navy",
      " It means the PLA Navy has received more ships in one year than many other navies have in total",
      "At the Airshow China 2022, held in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province in November, the J-20 fighter jet of the PLA Air Force for the first time put a static display in front of the general public, with many details visible",
      " It was announced that the independently developed stealth aircraft has entered all Eastern, Western, Southern, Northern and Central theater commands, indicating that the fighter jet is now in mass production, with US media outlet Defense News speculating that China has likely built more than 200 J-20s, surpassing the number of the US' F-22s",
      "The PLA Air Force also displayed its new YU-20 aerial tanker and a new type of what seems to be air-launched hypersonic ballistic missile carried by the H-6K bomber at the event",
      "In the large-scale exercises around the island of Taiwan in August, many of these advanced weapons and equipment, including the J-20 and the J-16 fighter jets, the YU-20 aerial tanker, the H-6K bomber, the modularized multiple rocket launcher system, conventional ballistic missiles, as well as multiple types of destroyers and frigates, demonstrated the PLA's capabilities in solving the Taiwan question and denying external forces from interfering, experts said",
      "More to comeIt was stressed at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in October in Beijing that achieving the goals for the centenary of the PLA in 2027 and more quickly elevating the people's armed forces to world-class standards are strategic tasks for building a modern socialist country in all respects",
      "Looking into the future, the PLA will continue its rapid development aiming for the centenary goal in 2027, basically complete modernization by 2035 and become world-class by the mid-21st century",
      "After the US revealed in December its new stealth bomber, the B-21, China is also expected to eventually unveil its next generation strategic bomber, the H-20, which is the last missing piece in China's strategic nuclear capability, Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military aviation expert, told the Global Times",
      "When the H-20 is completed, it will be around the same level as, if not surpassing, the B-21, Fu said",
      "By 2027, the country's third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, will likely be ready for combat, and equipped with new aircraft, including carrier-based stealth fighter jets and carrier-based early warning aircraft, and more advanced vessels, including the next generation frigate and the improved version of the Type 055 large destroyer, might enter service, said analysts, who also expect nuclear power for China's potentially in-development new aircraft carrier",
      "With the development of new weapons and equipment in new domains and of new qualities, as well as the enhancement of joint combat capabilities as a system through realistic combat-oriented exercises, the PLA will become increasingly capable of safeguarding national sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests amid future uncertainties, observers said",

      " Moreover, internal strife will continue in the DPP, but an unscrupulous power struggle will only harm Taiwan people, as they care more about their livelihoods",
      "There are three major factions in the DPP: the \"New Tide\" faction, the largest faction within the party led by DPP's party chief Lai Ching-te; Tsai's faction which includes Chen and Mayor of Kaohsiung Chen Chi-mai; and \"Taiwan Normal Country Promotion Association\" faction, led by the island's legislative body leader You Si-kun",

      "Wang Jianmin, a senior cross-Straits expert at Minnan Normal University in Fujian Province, said that factional struggle is DPP's tradition, which is crucial to the distribution of power and benefits",
      " Therefore, although the DPP agreed to dissolve factions in 2006, it did not fundamentally change the reality of the development of factions",
      "In Taiwan's regional \"legislative body\" in 2020, only six of the 61 DPP \"lawmakers\" have no factional background",
      " The \"New Tide\" is the biggest winner with 18 \"lawmakers,\" followed by 14 from Tsai's camp and nine from \"Taiwan Normal Country Promotion Association",
      "\"Attack and revengeThe fight within the DPP for a bigger slice of the pie is even fiercer than facing other parties",
      "Wang recalled to the Global Times how Su and Frank Hsieh fought for the nomination to represent DPP in regional leadership race",
      " He said that in addition to political attacks, the two men exchanged insults fiercely to a degree that were \"never seen before,\" even worse than smearing their enemies",
      "In the 2019 DPP primary election for regional leadership nomination, the Tsai's camp smeared Lai of the \"New Tide,\" and manipulated follow-up public opinion polls",
      "Lai retaliated by purging Tsai's advisers Hung Yao-fu, the former secretary-general of DPP, as soon as Lai became DPP's new party chief",
      "\"This is the beginning of Lai's revenge,\" Chiu said, noting that Tsai has the \"administrative machinery\" and control of the intelligence unit, which allows her faction to collect disgraceful evidence of political opponents for the media and use tax investigations to deter paymasters from backing Lai financially in election campaign, which is also a common tactic",
      "An unscrupulous power struggle will only make the people of the island disillusioned with the DPP and abandon it, as it only goes for political gains rather than people's livelihoods, Wang said",
      "According to a report from Taiwan-based media udn",
      "com that \"factional co-governance\" has always been a politer term, and its essence is not much different from \"sharing spoils",
      "\" Regarding to the new list of \"cabinet members,\" it is nothing more than appeasing different factions through resource allocation, with the subtext that \"no one is allowed to be rebellious",
      "\"Since the defeat in the local election in November 2022, DPP has been in a state of crisis, with factions competing for resources and the slightest mistake will break the factional balance",
      " Tsai's apparent balanced layout may trigger even worse imbalance, thus affecting DPP's election in 2024",
      "Some analysts, however, said the DPP has a history of factional conflict in surface, but preferring to seek to maintain its advantage as a whole over other parties through \"temporary solidarity\" after the conflict",
      "Lai Yueh-chien, a Taiwan-based political scholar, told the Global Times that although the \"New Tide\" is the largest faction in DPP, it will not be like a \"winner-takes-all\" way",
      " \"They always take a big chunk, and they share the spoils,\" he said",
      "Power struggle within the DPP is fierce, but people always find a way out, he said",
      " And that's why the opposition party like Kuomintang cannot afford to take the 2024 election lightly",

      " China issued a Global Security Initiative Concept Paper on Tuesday",
      " Photo: Chen Qingqing/GTChina on Tuesday released The Global Security Initiative Concept Paper, which expounds core concepts and principles of the Global Security Initiative (GSI), lays out 20 priorities of cooperation and five platforms and mechanisms of cooperation",
      " It plays an action-oriented guiding role",
      " The release of the concept paper marks an important step for China in putting its previously proposed GSI into practice, demonstrating China's responsibility for maintaining world peace and its firm determination to safeguard global security",
      " At a historical crossroads, as new cold war clouds are hanging over the world, the concept paper is another major public good offered by China to the world, a Chinese solution to solve the systemic security dilemma, and a new exploration for human society, with crucial historical significance",
      "The release of the concept paper comes against the backdrop of unprecedented global security challenges, which gives it stronger practical significance",
      " February 24 marks the first anniversary of the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which is the most prominent manifestation of Europe's security dilemma",
      " Meanwhile, other parts of the world are not peaceful either",
      " Conflicts in old hotspots have not ceased, while new security crises are brewing",
      " If the fuse cannot be dismantled in time, it will lead to more serious consequences",
      " If security dilemmas cannot be resolved, they will lead to war",
      " Humanity has already suffered enough painful lessons in this regard",
      " The GSI was born in response to the challenges of the times",
      "In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping initiated a new vision for common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security",
      " The vision stands at the height of a community with a shared future for mankind, surpassing the Western traditional security concept and power politics",
      " On April 21, 2022, Xi proposed the GSI based on the new vision for security at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference, which has received positive responses from the international community",
      " So far, more than 80 countries and regional organizations have expressed their appreciation and support",
      " At the same time, more and more voices are hoping that China's GSI can be further promoted",
      "This concept paper further enriches and elaborates on the GSI, with strong practical relevance and operability, aiming to promote a new path of security that emphasizes dialogue instead of confrontation, partnership instead of alliance, and win-win instead of zero-sum",
      " The concept paper meets the universal expectations of the international community, helps the international community to fully understand China's principles and concepts on global security issues, and guides relevant parties to find effective ways to deal with security disputes and address security dilemmas",
      "Regardless of their country or cultural background, as long as they do not have bias, prejudice, or narrow-minded personal interests, they can feel China's sincere attitude toward peace and the enormous value of Eastern wisdom in solving today's problems in the concept paper",
      "\"China's development cannot be separated from a stable international environment",
      " Similarly, without China's security, there will be no global security",
      "\" China is the only country in the world that has pledged to \"keep to a path of peaceful development\" in its Constitution",
      " China's development miracle over the past few decades has largely benefited from a peaceful environment, and the love of peace is deeply ingrained in Chinese traditional culture",
      " The GSI was not proposed by China by chance",
      "We have noticed that some Western public opinions hold subconscious biases and misunderstandings toward the concept paper",
      " They either simplify it as China's response to the West in the Russia-Ukraine issue, or claim that it is \"undermining the US' dominant position",
      "\" This is a very narrow and low-level understanding rooted in group political thinking",
      "What needs to be emphasized is that the propositions including the six commitments proposed in the concept paper start from historical experiences and focus on human beings' common future, which transcend the boundaries of ideology and apply to societies with different civilizations, races, and political systems, and has true universality",
      " China has repeatedly called on the world to join hands",
      " There is nothing exclusive, and it definitely includes the US and Western countries",
      "Security is a common concern for all mankind, and great powers should set an example",
      " Currently, there is too much hype about \"threats\" in the world, and too little discussion of the paths to achieve peace",
      " What people see in reality is the acceleration of actions that create panic and division under the banner of \"peace,\" and the tragedy of great power confrontation drawing closer once again",
      "Foreign policies of certain great powers are the main source of insecurity for the vast majority of the world",
      " Hence, the concept paper proposes that efforts should be made to promote coordination and positive interaction among great powers, and advocates that great powers should take the lead in promoting equality, good faith, cooperation, and the rule of law",
      " This is China's goodwill and expectation, and we sincerely hope that relevant major countries will meet each other halfway",
      "As stated in the concept paper, \"the issue of security bears on the well-being of people of all countries, the lofty cause of world peace and development, and the future of humanity",
      "\" We call on all countries to actively participate in GSI, to adapt to the profound changes in the international landscape with a spirit of unity, and to respond to complex security challenges with a win-win mindset, so that the flame of peace can be passed on from generation to generation and the sound of peace can ring throughout the world!

Well, it's a real thing and Michael Crichton, the famous doctor, writer, scientist movie maker among many other things, gave it a name - the Gell-Mann Effect",
      "I've said it before and will no doubt say it again, when I arrived in China, I had a very different perspective on what I was seeing to what I thought I knew about China",
      " It really didn't take me long to understand much of it was wrong; probably about 24 hours",
      "What I was seeing in real life didn't matter at that time because my media consumption was telling me China was slowing, China was collapsing, China was a bad place to be and it must have been true because even the BBC said so",
      " But",
      "",
      "",
      " China didn't collapse when they said it would",
      "As my years of living in China extended, I started to notice things: China said it would build a bridge to Hong Kong, they said they would put two high speed train stations into the city where I lived, they said they would build a new university and another hospital in downtown and I've seen many governments promise to do things like this; but then China actually went and did them all",
      "In the UK, back in 2013, I read about a high-speed rail link that will be completed by 2045 and, if it ever finishes, it will be a total of 530 kilometers",
      " Most of it is still being planned and much of it is still unapproved by Parliament - it might be finished in 2045",
      "",
      "",

      " China opens an average of eight new airports a year, while reportedly collapsing",
      "Why is my news telling me one thing, when my ears and eyes are showing me something completely different?I also noticed that the standard of living has improved",
      " When I came here, almost no one had a car, now almost everyone does",
      " Corruption, pollution, and crime are almost non-existent",
      " Education, health, and the economy have all improved and yet, everything I read in the news about China says the opposite",
      "I witnessed how life in China has improved, it was clear that people in the West were being misinformed about this one topic that I actually know about",
      " But I still wanted to believe the rest of the things I read were true - that was the Gell-Mann Effect",
      "I started to question the things I don't know about",

Go look it up, it's true",
      "What's going on in Ukraine and why can't I easily find information from both sides of this conflict?Why did the US invade Iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction there but that was their reason for doing so?It's simple, we're being misinformed about almost everything we're reading, hearing and watching in Western media",
      " From time to time, we know we're being misinformed but we continue to believe it when we don't know",
      " That's the Gell-Mann Effect in action",
      " We want to believe something is true when we want it to be so",
      "If you want to believe China will collapse soon and you want to believe China is a threat you can read that every single day in your media but think about the logic of that",
      " How can a country that's been in decline for dozens of years build all that infrastructure",
      " How is a country that has never invaded or attacked another in your lifetime be a threat",
      " Think about this: who is telling you these things?Remember the expression: \"if you don't read the papers you're uninformed, if you do, you're misinformed\" and we're all told it was said by Mark Twain, well, once again, we're misinformed even about that - there's no record Mark Twain ever said it but there is a similar quote from Thomas Jefferson who, in an 1807 letter said \"nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper\" and went on to say that \"the man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them",

      " Officers and soldiers of the 42nd Chinese naval escort fleet wave to the crowd at the Port of Richards Bay, South Africa, Feb",
      " 19, 2023",
      "(Photo: Xinhua)A top US Navy official recently claimed that the US is trailing China in building warships and accused the country of using \"slave labor,\" in a publicity stunt that Chinese experts said was aimed at hyping the \"Chinese threat\" theory to gain more funding",
      "The US Navy fleet still leads the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy by far in terms of actual capabilities, which are reflected more by total displacement rather than number of ships, they said",
      "US Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said on Tuesday at the National Press Club in Washington that China's navy \"has significant advantages over its US rival, including a bigger fleet and greater shipbuilding capacity,\" CNN reported on Wednesday",
      "The US must upgrade its fleet in response, he said, as the PLA Navy has about 340 ships and the number is increasing, while the US has less than 300, according to the CNN report",
      "Del Toro claimed that US naval shipyards cannot match the output of Chinese ones, as China has more shipyards while the US lacks skilled labor",
      "In recent years, the PLA Navy has indeed made huge strides and built dozens of modern warships, including those of the Type 052D and Type 055 destroyers, the Type 075 amphibious assault ship, plus the Fujian, an electromagnetic catapult-equipped aircraft carrier",
      " However, they serve the needs of China's normal and rightful national defense modernization amid the country's growing comprehensive national strength and complicated national security situation",
      " Even so, the US Navy is still far ahead of the PLA Navy overall, experts said",
      "The US should not gauge a navy's capability by the number of ships, as the real indicators should be the total displacement and technologies, a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "Many Chinese vessels are small corvettes and boats used for coastal defense, which are vastly different from US aircraft carriers and cruisers that are designed for global deployment, the expert said",
      "Song Zhongping, another Chinese military expert, told the Global Times that the US Navy operates 11 nuclear-powered super carriers and uses the most cutting-edge nuclear-powered submarines",
      "By hyping the \"China warship number threat,\" the US Navy is just seeking more funds from Congress so that it can further expand and maintain its global hegemony, experts said",
      "Del Toro also accused the Chinese shipbuilding industry of using \"slave labor,\" but his remark was refuted even in the CNN report, which quoted Blake Herzinger, a nonresident fellow and Indo-Pacific defense policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute, as saying that \"China has a very large pool of available manpower and it wouldn't really make sense to use slave labor in a high-tech sector vital to their national security",
      "\"Herzinger said comments like that from the US Navy chief are indicative of a pattern where US attention is put in the wrong place, as the US Navy leadership throws stones at real or imagined faults in Chinese shipbuilding rather than reckoning with US failures over two decades to conceptualize, design and build ships for its own navy",
      "The US Navy Secretary's accusation is just another publicity stunt aimed at gaining attention in US political circles, Chinese experts said",
      " They said that if the US really realized that its shipbuilding industry lacks skilled labor, it should resolve the problems by raising the pay for designers and workers rather than making accusations against China",

      " He is expected to promote peace talks as the Russia-Ukraine conflict approaches the one-year mark, with the situation still deteriorating",
      " Analysts said that China's tangible moves in de-escalating the situation have been in stark contrast to the US' fanning of flames",

      "\"Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, started his trip to Russia after visiting France, Italy, Hungary and his eye-catching engagement at the Munich Security Conference",
      "Wang's trip has attracted great attention as he is reportedlythe highest-ranking Chinese official to visit Europe since the the conclusion of the 20th CPC National Congress, and also because his trip is taking place just days before the one-year anniversary of the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict when the international community is eager to seek a better solution to ease the tense situation",
      "Wang's trip to Russia, the latest interaction between China and Russia, will pave the way for further and higher-level communication as mutual political trust continue to deepen",
      " The Russia-Ukraine conflict is also high on the agenda, analysts said",
      "China and Russia have maintained frequent high-level interactions in recent years from heads of state to diplomatic agencies",
      " For example, on February 2 and 3, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu paid a visit to Russia and met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov",
      "The close relations between China and Russia have been advanced by their cooperation in various fields and close international coordination and their shared support to the international community in defending international fairness and justice, and resisting hegemony, Wang Chenxing, a research fellow from Institute of Russia, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), told the Global Times on Monday",
      "However, the US and a handful Western countries are trying to tie up China and Russia especially in the Ukraine crisis for their own geopolitical strategic purposes, analysts said",
      "Stark contrastOne day after meeting with Wang Yi on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told media that China is considering giving Russia weapons and ammunition for the Ukraine war",
      "The top US diplomat did not elaborate on what information the US had received about China's potential plans, and said that it would be primarily weapons as well as ammunition, BBC reported",
      "The US invents these charges against China to drum strategic conspiracy of \"China support to Russia,\" and by hyping \"threats\" from China and Russia, it can unify the West and further boost transatlantic allies, said Wang Chenxing",
      "Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times that the US wants to tie China with Russia on its opposite side so that when Russia gains the upper hand on the battlefield with Ukraine, it can put the blame on China",
      "Blinken's remarks are also the US way to drawing up \"red line\" for China, warning it to shun providing military aid to Russia, Cui said",
      " China has also repeatedly made it clear that its ties with Russia are not targeting any third party, and is not a military alliance",
      "Responding to Blinken's remarks, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Monday that the US is not qualified to give orders to China and it is the US that has been arming the battlefield",
      " And China will never allow the US to boss it around or even exert pressure on China-Russia relations",
      "China's stance on the Ukraine crisis has always been clear and consistent - promoting peace talks",
      " This is also the message sent by Wang Yi when meeting with Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and will also be the stance when meeting with Russian leaders in Moscow, Wang Chenxing said",
      "Cui said that Wang's trip to Russia has conveyed a strong political signal about China's concerns for global security",
      " \"It provided China's solution to the tensions fueling security situation worldwide",

      "The conflict has claimed many lives and caused higher losses",

      " US Taiwan policy Illustration: Chen Xia/GTThe Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command on Sunday organized cross-service joint combat alert patrols and joint fire strike exercises in maritime and aerial areas around the island of Taiwan after the US continued down a provocative and dangerous path of playing the \"Taiwan card\" to suppress China with its latest defense bill, including $10 billion in security assistance and fast-tracked weapons procurement for the island",
      "In a resolute response to the recent escalation in the US-Taiwan collusion, Senior Colonel Shi Yi, a spokesperson of the PLA Eastern Theater Command, said in a statement on Sunday that the command troops will take any necessary measures to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity",
      "Photos released with the statement show that the H-6 strategic bomber and the Type 052C guided missile destroyer are some of the forces that took part in the exercises, and warplanes were able to visually confirm the Central Mountain Range of the Taiwan island",
      "Given that the US' National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, which contains a large number of negative provisions targeting China and signed by the US President Joe Biden on Friday, marked the first time the US government will finance weapons for the island, multiple Chinese government departments, including the Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), have voiced opposition to the US' defense act",
      "The US defense act mentions \"China\" and \"Chinese\" 331 times, \"Taiwan\" 467 times, \"Ukraine\" and \"Ukrainian\" 165 times, and \"Russia\" &\"Russian\" 401 times, which prompted a question from Chinese observers \"has any other country mentioned other countries and regions so many times in its national defense act?\"Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense, said in a statement released on Saturday that \"China is strongly dissatisfied with and firmly opposed to the US' move, and has lodged solemn representations with the US side",
      "\"Tan said that for a certain period, the US has been constantly hollowing out and distorting the one-China principle, frequently selling arms to the Taiwan island, strengthening its military connection with the island, and concocting Taiwan-related acts that damage China's sovereignty, which seriously jeopardizes peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits and increases the risk of a China-US military confrontation",
      "\"The Chinese People's Liberation Army will, as always, be ready to resolutely safeguard national reunification and the territorial integrity of the country,\" Tan stressed",
      "You Wenze, a spokesperson of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the NPC, on Saturday also voiced strong dissatisfaction with and firm opposition to the China-related content of the new US defense act",
      " Any attempts to use the island to contain China or support the separatist forces for \"Taiwan independence\" will only further escalate tensions across the Taiwan Straits and undermine the political foundation of China-US relations, You said",
      "\"Any provocation that attempts to interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's interests will be met with firm countermeasures,\" You said",
      "The new act stipulates that the US government will provide Taiwan with $10 billion as military aid and $2 billion as military loans within five years, and will accelerate arms sales to the Taiwan island",
      " This further indicates that some forces in the US are trying to support the \"Taiwan independence\" secessionists with arms in the military, provoking confrontation across the Taiwan Straits and pushing the two sides of the Straits to the brink of war, Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office, said in a statement on Saturday",
      "Referring to the Taiwan question, Wang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, state councilor and foreign minister, said on Sunday at the Symposium on the International Situation and China's Foreign Relations that \"we have not been intimidated by any hegemonic power or its bullying, and have acted resolutely to safeguard China's core interests and national dignity",
      "\"\"The Taiwan question is at the very core of China's core interests",
      " It is the bedrock of the political foundation of China-US relations, and a red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations,\" Wang said",
      "Two days ago, Wang had a phone call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in which he pointed out that the US should not pursue dialogue and cooperation while containing and stabbing China in the back",
      "The US legislated its arms sales to the Taiwan region, which seriously provoked China's core interests and sent a supportive signal to the \"Taiwan independence\" secessionists, Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Sunday, saying that it was another serious escalation by the US in strengthening military ties with the island",
      "In the future, the US is likely to sell advanced weapons and equipment to the Taiwan authorities instead of secondhand, defective weapons and equipment like it sold in the past, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times",
      "Given that a formal opinion was also written into the act urging the Pentagon to have the Taiwan region be part of the 2024 Rim of the Pacific joint exercises, Song believes that Washington could push the Taiwan authorities, especially the local military, further into the international community and strengthen military exchanges, as well as send more troops to the island in an attempt to help the secessionist authorities resist the process of reunification",
      "The defense act also requires the responsible authorities to prioritize and, with no bundled arrangement allowed, expedite the processing of Taiwan's arms purchase requests, which Song said would cause the Taiwan authorities to invest more money to buy more weapons and equipment, thus intensifying tensions across the Straits and making military conflicts more possible",
      "Xin said that after the passage of the defense bill, an \"arms race\" and \"military conflicts\" are more possible but the island is far from capable of having an arms race with the Chinese mainland",
      "The bill, which again exposed the US' continuous maneuvers of hollowing out and distorting the one-China principle, will surely trigger China's countermeasures, the expert warned",

      "Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force spotted a PLA Navy flotilla consisting of the aircraft carrier Liaoning, the Type 055 large destroyers Anshan and Wuxi, the Type 052D destroyer Chengdu, the Type 054A frigate Zaozhuang and the Type 901 comprehensive replenishment ship Hulunhu sailing from the West Pacific through the Miyako Strait into the East China Sea on Sunday, Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff said in a press release on Monday",
      "The Chinese warships entered the West Pacific through the Miyako Strait on December 16, and held exercises in waters east of the island of Taiwan and south of Japan, as well as waters west of Guam before they returned, according to the Japanese press release",
      "In tandem with the Liaoning aircraft carrier group's return, the PLA also sent a WZ-7 high-altitude reconnaissance drone through the Miyako Strait on Sunday and Monday, marking the first time Japan's Air Self-Defense Force has spotted this type of aircraft",
      "In the 15 days from December 17 to Saturday, the aircraft carrier Liaoning hosted about 320 fighter jets and helicopter takeoff and landing activities, the Japanese Defense Ministry said",
      " This intensive sortie rate set a record, surpassing the Liaoning's drills in the West Pacific in May 2022 with over 300 aircraft sorties in some 20 days",
      "By including two Type 055 large destroyers for the first time, observers said the flotilla is by far the most powerful Liaoning aircraft carrier group",
      "It is also the first time the Chinese aircraft carrier was spotted operating near Guam, meaning that the record-breaking voyage not only broke the first island chain, but also reached the second island chain, analysts said",
      "The Liaoning is not meant to stay in homeport, and drills in the far sea have become regular and routine, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times",
      "The Liaoning carrier group has formed complete combat and support capabilities with enhanced vessel-aircraft interoperability, and China now has the comprehensive capability to seize air supremacy and control of the sea far away from its homeland, Song said",

      "For instance, issues of resource allocation, a unified command structure, Japan's use of US military bases, and coordination of intelligence and reconnaissance are all likely to feature in the \"2+2\" security talks, Zhu noted",

      "The US plans to push Japan to the front line of the conflict so Japan takes the brunt of the attack so China could not wipe out US forces, Zhu said, noting this is also why US armed forces in the Western Pacific are showing a trend of dispersed deployments as Japan's national security strategy shifts to its southwestern islands",
      "In fact, in Japan's three key defense documents revised in December, the Kishida administration pledged to strengthen Self-Defense Forces units in its southwestern islands, describing China as its \"greatest strategic challenge",

      " Actually, the US, which has touted \"freedom of the press,\" has restricted foreign journalists, arrested domestic journalists and hindered the freedom of the press, analysts said",

      "Analysts said that listing Chinese media outlets as foreign missions puts them under the full supervision of US administrative departments and strips them of the rights that they are entitled to under domestic and international law",

      " Photo: AFPWhile Europe is showing \"unswerving\" support for Ukraine in terms of military and financial aid, it is far from ready to admit the country into the EU at such a fast pace, as some member states have warned that it should be made clear that this will not be possible",
      "France, Germany, Italy and the Benelux nations have also warned against striking an overly optimistic tone over the joint statement to be released after the summit, BBC reported, and last May, French President Emmanuel Macron warned it could take \"decades\" before Ukraine meets the criteria and achieves full membership",
      "The last country to join the EU was Croatia in 2013, a decade after formally applying",
      " For Ukraine's neighbor Poland, it took 20 years before it joined in 2004, according to media reports",
      "The West is showing great divergences over opening a \"fast track\" for Ukraine's admission into the EU",
      " \"Two voices are fighting within the system - one insisting that Ukraine follow the rules and join after meeting all the criteria, while the other says it should be handled as a special case, showing support for Ukraine by admitting it into the organization so as to further pull it in, which is also in line with the long-term interests of Europe,\" Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Friday",
      "Ukraine did not stand a serious chance of becoming a candidate before the conflict broke out, analysts said, as it was far from being able to meet the membership standards given its less developed economy and outstanding corruption issues",
      "A fresh wave of anti-corruption raids was carried out in Ukraine ahead of the summit in a bid to appease EU leaders",
      " Among those targeted were residences linked to influential billionaire Igor Kolomoisky, one of the country's richest men, who has holdings in a slew of industries, including media, aviation and energy, France24 reported",
      "The reason why Ukraine was able to become a candidate was out of political considerations, Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Friday",
      "\"Saying yes to Ukraine has become a politically correct thing to do for Europe, but there are indeed difficulties involved in admitting Ukraine at this point, especially with a heavy fiscal burden under such high inflation,\" Cui Heng noted",
      "\"They don't want their cake to be split even more, but they dare not say this when they feel themselves that they 'ought to do the right thing,'\" Cui added",
      "The other reason the EU will not admit Ukraine at this point is that it doesn't want to anger Russia and stir up trouble that will invite conflict to its own doorstep, analysts noted",
      "Experts called on the EU to reflect on its stance toward the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and stop being further dragged down the vortex as it has been, which has brought about serious consequences including economic recession, an energy crisis, massive strikes and livelihood issues",
      "Overall military support from the EU to Ukraine is estimated at being close to 12 billion euros ($13",
      "1 billion)",
      " Overall assistance to Ukraine pledged at both EU and member state levels so far amounts to nearly 50 billion euros ($54",

      " Illustration: Tang Tengfei/Global TimesWhen looking at China, the ongoing two sessions are a window",
      " As the meetings unfold, wave of data pours out of the window",
      " While looking at GDP, defense spending, R&D investment, and other key data, please pay attention to the CPI",
      "China's consumer price index(CPI), a main gauge of inflation, rose 2 percent year on year in 2022, which shined among major global economies",
      " Moreover, in a government work report submitted Sunday to the national legislature for deliberation, China has set a 2023 target of around 3 percent for its CPI - only one percent increase",
      "Our recommendation is to compare the CPI with that of the US and some Western countries before judging or anticipating the direction of China's economic policy",
      "After hitting a 40-year peak inflation rate of 9",
      "1 percent in June 2022, the US has seen seven consecutive months of decline",
      " However, the CPI still rose more than market expectations in January",
      " It is also estimated that inflation across the eurozone reached 8",
      "5 percent in January",
      "By March of this year, the Federal Reserve has handily suppressed inflation for a whole year, but the effect still does not seem to be obvious",
      " Inflation in the US is probably becoming a chronic disease severely constraining the US economy and causing the most pains to the global economy",
      "Why is inflation so severe in the US and so low in China?Behind the different economic cycles, structures and elements included in the CPI are the different economic policies to deal with the spread of COVID-19",
      " Today's inflation in the US comes from indiscriminate issuance of money (subsidies), trillions of greenbacks spread out",
      " Can it not be inflationary?Conversely, China has adopted a completely different policy and maintained a prudent monetary policy",
      " In contrast to the \"open floodgates\" in Europe and the US, the Chinese government has been cautious about a comprehensive stimulus package, avoiding an overly loose monetary policy and not injecting too much liquidity into the market",
      "China does this because it has the world's most extensive manufacturing system, a large industrial capacity and trade surplus, and is largely self-sufficient in food and coal, with ample oil reserves and diversified energy imports",
      " Thus, the Chinese government can respond more comfortably to global commodity price increases and other imported inflation",
      "China is a responsible country, and it will not adopt a selfish economic policy in these difficult times, shifting the burden it should have borne to the world",
      "What is more? During Donald Trump's term, Washington wielded the trade sanctions stick against China",
      " The Joe Biden administration has followed suit and sought to \"decouple\" from China in the supply chain of critical products, preventing the smooth functioning of the global supply system, inadvertently increasing the cost of supply, and pushing up commodity prices",
      "China is a developing socialist country with a large population",
      " The government is more focused on building the foundation for stable social welfare development, so its policies during the epidemic focused on raising subsidies mainly for low-income people, raising pensions and health insurance levels, and reducing tax burdens for small and medium-sized enterprises to ensure the basic needs of the people while maintaining the broad fundamental base of China's manufacturing industry",
      " This is reflected in Sunday's government work report and foreshadows the direction of China's future economic policy focus",
      "China's economy is in an upward period of steady recovery after the epidemic, and inflation is expected to rise gradually",
      " However, work report shows that China will continue to take the initiative to control inflation and consolidate the policy of preventing inflationary input externally and deflationary pressure internally",
      "At a time when major global economies still have to cope with inflation in a nervous and hectic manner, a strongly recovering China with a low inflation will show the world the policy-control capabilities its government has and will give more confidence to those who are worried about the global economy",

      "Photo: VCGSouth Korea should avoid sleepwalking in its diplomatic policies and serving as a pawn of the US, Chinese experts warned, as President Yoon Suk-yeol faces a backlash from the domestic public after he said that Japan is \"a partner\" in regional economic and security affairs during a speech to commemorate the 104th anniversary of the March 1 Independence Movement",
      "Without urging Japan to apologize to or compensate war victims, Yoon said that \"Japan has transformed from a militaristic aggressor of the past into a partner that shares the same universal values\" a century after the March First Independence Movement, according to a full text of the speech released by the Yonhap News Agency on Wednesday",
      "Yoon noted that \"trilateral cooperation among the Republic of Korea, the United States and Japan has become more important than ever to overcome security crises including North Korea's growing nuclear threats and the global polycrisis",
      "\"It is rare for a South Korean president to use such fawning words toward Japan on the day",
      " It has been interpreted as a gesture to mend ties with Japan by some US and Japanese media, according to experts",
      "Making a goodwill gesture to Japan and advocating Seoul-Tokyo-Washington security cooperation on the March 1 Movement anniversary day raises eyebrows, as the day marks South Korean people's brave, unyielding, resistance spirit",
      "It is the day marking national humiliation, according to L\u00fc Chao, an expert on the Korean Peninsula issue at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences",
      "The speech is the latest reflection that the Yoon administration has been hypnotized and entered a sleepwalking state in its diplomatic policies, according to analysts",
      "South Korea used to pay attention to keeping a balance between China and the US, and that strategy brought many benefits",
      "In the past three decades since the two countries established diplomatic ties, bilateral trade increased by 72 times",
      " In 2021, the value exceeded $360 billion",
      "South Korea should be an important player in the complex situation in Northeast Asia",
      " Hope it can walk in a more stable fashion and not turn itself into a pawn of the US, observers stressed",
      "Soon after the speech was delivered, some 200 civic activists gathered near the Japanese Embassy in Seoul on Wednesday, urging Yoon to keep his promise of resolving historic disputes with the neighboring country, including the one over sexual slavery during Japan's 1910-45 rule of the Korean Peninsula",
      "The Korean Peninsula was colonized by Imperial Japan from 1910 to 1945",
      " During the nationwide independence movement on March 1, 1919, about 7,500 Koreans were killed and some 50,000 arrested under the brutal crackdown of Japan",

      " NATO Illustration: Chen Xia/Global TimesDragging South Korea deeper into the abyss of providing aid to Ukraine, NATO is testing how closely Seoul is willing to tie itself to the Washington-led military alliance",
      " Its ultimate goal is to extend its tentacles even further into Asia-Pacific through its partners in the region",
      "During his visit to South Korea, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Monday called on South Korea to strengthen its military assistance to Ukraine and even consider allowing direct arms exports",
      "Against the backdrop of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, NATO is trying to persuade its members and partners to form a bigger camp that supports Kiev politically and militarily",
      " In this process, it will be necessary for these countries to provide whatever helps as much as possible",
      " Therefore, according to this logic, since South Korea has a relatively advanced and productive defense industry, the country needs to export more weapons to Ukraine",
      "Among the countries that have supplied weapons to Kiev, Seoul has performed a very limited function, providing arms of relatively small quantities and low levels",
      " But for NATO, it does not matter what kind of weapons South Korea has offered or plans to offer; what is more important is if Seoul will show the gesture of agreeing to enhance the assistance",
      " In other words, Stoltenberg's urge comes more likely from a political perspective than military needs",
      "NATO seeks to transform itself from a regional organization into a global one",
      " Under this goal, one of its grips is to bring the US allies in the East closer",
      " As a result, with all its strength, NATO has been working on its two main pivots in the Asia-Pacific region - Japan and South Korea",
      "Under Washington's instigation, NATO is trying to extend its tentacles more deeply into the region and get more regional countries involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict to share US risks in international politics",
      " Shaping a local conflict in Europe into a global problem serves only the US Indo-Pacific Strategy",
      "For the NATO Secretary General, the immediate goal of urging Seoul to change its policy is to form a more solid Western alliance to aid Ukraine in this ongoing conflict",
      " But in terms of medium- and long-term strategic objectives, he wants Seoul to tie to the NATO chariot more tightly",
      " In this way, the organization will be able to use South Korea as an entry point into Asia-Pacific affairs more easily",
      "Therefore, in the eyes of the US, if South Korea is involved in a European military conflict, then it is suitable for NATO to interfere in the possible disputes and conflicts in East Asia, especially under the guise of a just international organization",
      "Experts believe that South Korea, for its own sake, may not be able to resist NATO's pressure",
      " For one, cooperation with NATO will help Seoul strengthen its global presence",
      " On the other hand, since South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has set the goal of pushing his country to become the world's fourth-largest arms exporter by 2027, it is difficult for South Korea - driven by economic interests - to continue moving cautiously and slowly on selling more weapons",
      "To persuade South Korea better, Stoltenberg even used the example of how several NATO allies who had as a policy never to export weapons to countries in conflict have changed that policy",
      " But what we actually see here is how these countries have finally shown their true colors under the mask of hypocrisy, becoming fully subject to Washington's strategies and policies",
      "The dangerous step these countries made can easily pull the entire Europe to the brink of conflict",
      " As a result, it is afraid that such an action will prolong the Russia-Ukraine conflict, intensify the tension between NATO countries and Russia and complicate the situation in Europe",
      "The West always talks about \"rules-based order,\" but if the rules can be changed so easily just because of the US-led West's strategic interests, there is no way to talk about an order",
      " It will not only impact the current situation, but also pose a severe and long-term challenge to the entire system of rules in international relations",

      " US overreacts by shooting down Chinese weather balloon",
      " Cartoon: Carlos LatuffAmerican military and political leaders, and the front pages of the corporate media, have been devoted to the denunciation of China for allowing a balloon to float across the Pacific Ocean and across North America",
      " Although spokesmen for the Pentagon had acknowledged that the balloon actually posed no threat to the US and that any information the so-called spy balloon might gather would be only a redundant version of information routinely available to satellites and already widely known in intelligence circles around the world, pundits and politicians have been almost hysterical to outshout one another and demonstrate their hatred and aggressive intentions toward China",
      " All of this would be funny, if it weren't so dangerous",
      "It has been clear for a long time now, since at least the \"Pivot to Asia\" announced by former president Barack Obama in 2011, that the US has embarked on a campaign to isolate and contain China, to try to disrupt China's development and derail its efforts to improve the lives of its people and the peoples of other developing countries around the world",
      " The American military maintains bases all around China, and US intelligence agencies operate highly sophisticated listening posts to monitor communications and other kinds of information sources within China",
      " American spy planes routinely fly just beyond the limits of China's airspace, sometimes even venturing into that airspace, to gather information",
      " And of course the US has a long history of \"overflights\" by the infamous U-2 aircraft to spy on Cuba, the former Soviet Union, and other countries, not to mention the many American surveillance satellites which track over China every day",
      "All of this makes the current flap over a Chinese balloon drifting across the country seem rather ridiculous",
      " The melodramatic shooting down of the balloon just off the coast of South Carolina was so absurd that the popular American television show Saturday Night Live made it the focus of their opening comedy routine the following night",
      " The hypocrisy and posturing of everyone from President Joe Biden to members of Congress, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Pentagon generals, intelligence spokespersons, and various media outlets is stunning",
      "Sadly, this is just the latest round in the ongoing effort to demonize China, to prepare the American people for possible conflict, and to ensure that most Americans have only the most one-sided and hostile kind of knowledge and information",
      " American elites are fearful of the decline of the US as the dominant power in world affairs, afraid of losing the power and privileges which they have enjoyed for many decades and the ability to enforce their will on peoples and countries around the planet",
      " As the Western industrialized economies have lost their monopoly on modern technologies of production, and countries which were formerly the subordinate components of a global system of exploitation and extraction which enriched American and European elites have pursued their own paths of development, American domination has eroded, and a new world order has begun to emerge",
      " China has been a leading example of this, having raised the material conditions of the lives of its people over the past 70 years, extending life expectancy, drastically reducing infant mortality, improving housing, providing educational opportunities, and creating national health care systems which saved millions of lives through the course of the COVID-19 epidemic",
      "China is returning to the kind of role in global affairs it occupied for many centuries before the onset of Western imperialism in the 19th century and the invasion and exploitation of the country in the Opium War and the following century until the successful revolution led by the Communist Party of China culminated in the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949",
      " The accomplishments of the Chinese people since then are a source of justifiable pride for their country, and serve as an inspiration for many people around the world, but for American elites they represent an existential threat",
      " The rich and powerful in America do not want to share the wealth created by working people with those who actually produce it, in their own country or elsewhere",
      " The fear and hatred generated by their realization that the times are changing and that the future will be different is driving them to ever more reckless actions and provocations directed at China",
      " This is a danger to people in China, in America, and around the planet",
      "This is an age when the world's people face profound challenges",
      " Climate change and global warming threaten the very existence of society in the coming decades",
      " Inequality and injustice destroy lives every day",
      " It is an era when the resources of the world should be directed to solving these critical challenges, not to fanning the flames of \"great power conflict\" as American politicians and military leaders are doing",
      " That a balloon drifting across North America, which posed no threat to anyone, should be the focus of so much hyped up anger, and be shot down by fighter jets with missiles, is a colossal demonstration of how warped the thinking in the White House, Congress, and the Pentagon has become",
      " China and America should be working together to build a better future, one in which peace and justice are the goals, and in which improving the quality of life for all is the objective, not the perpetuation of the power of a few to enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else",

      " The first CPAC in Brazil took place on October 2019 in Sao Paulo, attended by leading American conservatives and Eduardo Bolsonaro",
      "\"Both Trump and Bolsonaro have endorsed the CPAC while they were in office, and made its far-right conservatism taken root in their countries,\" Zhou said, \"and the two riots reflected the same logic, which is denial of the election results, and even the system itself",
      "\"Brazil is an important part of CPAC's global outreach to far-right conservatives, and whether Lula can contain the flames of the far right is not only crucial for Brazil but also Latin America, Zhou said",
      "Wang Youming, director of the Institute of Developing Countries at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times that if Trump, or a far-right populist like him, is elected as US president in 2024, that may not be good news for Latin America's stability, especially given the record of the US intervening in the regional affairs through color revolution and military intervention",
      "Without a full industrialization, it is easy to cause social protests and even violent impact if the American style democratic election is copied, Wang said, noting that the democratic politics in Latin America is fragile and unstable",
      "When the Capitol Hill riot has made the US fall from the so-called \"altar of democracy,\" US politicians are still exporting its political models, causing instability in other countries, Wang said",
      "Theimpactof far-rightAccording to Chinese experts, \"Capitol Hill riot\" has the possibility to repeat in other Latin American countries, with regard to the spillover effect of Brazil, the biggest country in the region",
      "Brazilian politics is a bellwether for regional politics, said Wang, noting that Bolsonaro, a follower of Trump, also has populist or right-wing imitators in Latin America",
      "Despite Lula's victory was viewed as part of Latin America's \"new pink tide\": eight countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Peru and Chile have elected left-wing leaders since 2018, experts believe that the \"pink tide\" is still fragile",
      "In Brazil, Colombia and Chile, the left wing won on the basis of broader electoral coalitions, while the far right was only narrowly behind, Zhou said",
      "In the past, a country could improve its people's livelihood through international cooperation",
      " However, current prolonged global economic downturn and geopolitical contradictions have made it more difficult",
      "And if people's livelihoods are not continuously improved, social contradictions will be intensified, resulting in dissatisfaction with the current system, especially in Latin America, where the poor population is still relatively large, Zhou said, \"That's how the far right rise",
      "\"These problems are not unique to Brazil, which raises the possibility that the pattern of Capitol Hill attack could be replicated in Latin America, Zhou said",
      "Theimpact of far right will intensify political antagonism in Latin America, which means not only limiting the policy arrangements of left-wing governments, but also increasing political and economic risks in the region, experts said",
      "The leftwing government pays more attention to social justice and people's livelihoods",
      " In an environment of political confrontation, the leftwing policy proposition and implementation may be compromised, especially considering that the fiscal condition is relatively tight under the economic downturn, Zhou said",

      " Illustration: Xia Qing/GTWhen one reads the 2022 National Security Strategy of the US, it becomes crystal clear that, at least according to the world view as promulgated by the administration of President Joe Biden, the US and China are on trajectory that can only lead to one thing - military confrontation",
      "At the core of this assessment is the enduring belief on the part of the Biden administration that the key to America's continued role as a world leader is the reinvigoration of \"America's unmatched network of alliances and partnerships to uphold and strengthen the principles and institutions that have enabled so much stability, prosperity, and growth for the last 75 years",
      "\"The Biden administration has a name for this network - the rules-based international order",
      " And sustaining the grip this order has on the world represents an existential challenge for the US",
      "According to the Biden administration, \"The [People's Republic of China] is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective",
      "\"China, the Biden administration believes, is the greatest threat to the US, something the Biden administration makes abundantly clear",
      " \"The People's Republic of China harbors the intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its benefit, even as the US remains committed to managing the competition between our countries responsibly",
      "\"The \"responsible management\" the Biden administration speaks of draws upon an \"unrivaled network of allies and partners\" which \"protects and advances our interests around the world",
      "\" The Biden administration's strategy for \"competing\" with China requires the US to \"assemble the strongest possible coalitions",
      "\"But when one looks at the coalitions highlighted by the Biden administration as being central to this effort, one is struck by the exclusively militaristic nature of their mission-the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Australia-UK-US (AUKUS) security partnership, and a \"revitalized Quad\", which brings together the US with Japan, India, and Australia in a security arrangement designed to contain Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region-are all, at their core, military alliances",
      "\"Competition\", when it comes to the US approach toward China, is better defined as \"deterrence\", and \"deterrence\" is a military mission, one which the Biden administration has pledged to \"act urgently to sustain and strengthen\", noting that China is the \"pacing challenge",
      "\"The result of the Biden administration's approach toward China is the militarization of what should be a classic problem of diplomacy, where the traditional tools of negotiation are increasingly replaced by confrontation",
      "The most recent example of this militarized approach is the so-called \"Chinese Spy Balloon\" crisis, where the Biden administration used the incursion by what clearly was a wayward high-altitude balloon equipped with sensors designed to collect atmospheric information used to investigate climate change to generate hysteria about a non-existent Chinese threat",
      " This hysteria culminated in the US employing Air Force fighter aircraft to shoot down the balloon, destroying both it and its scientific payload",
      "The extent to which the Biden administration has supplanted diplomacy with \"militarized\" competition is underscored by the fact that, because of this self-generated Sinophobia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken cancelled plans to travel to China for high-level talks",
      " At a time when the US and China should be exhausting every opportunity to engage in the kind of constructive dialogue the Biden administration claims as its principal tool for managing its relationship with China, the US has instead embarked on a phrenetic \"balloon chase\", where US fighter aircraft scour the American skies for even more \"made in China\" balloons to shoot down",
      "The militarization of US-Chinese relations reached its apex recently when US Air Force General Mike Minihan, the head of the US Air Mobility Command (AMC), issued a memorandum declaring that his \"gut\" told him that the US and China would be at war by 2025, and instructing the men and women under his command practice pistol marksmanship by firing a full \"clip\" of ammunition into a 7-meter target, aiming for the head",
      "While General Minihan's superiors have distanced themselves from the memorandum, the fact is his undiplomatic language is reflective of a core assessment dating back to 2021 known as \"the Davidson Window\", named after the former commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Philip Davidson, who postulated at that time that China would invade Taiwan within six years",
      " The \"Davidson Window\" guides the posture of a US military which, by the Biden administration's own admission, uses China as its \"pacing challenge",
      "\"The Biden administration would be well-advised to become grounded in old-school diplomacy rather than chasing balloons in the sky because, left unchecked, the ongoing militarization of the US-Chinese relationship can only lead to disaster",

      " After US' veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published his report \"How America Took Out The Nord Stream Pipeline\" on February 8, he encountered an even more abnormal anomaly",
      " Instead of a stone, the report is a heavy bomb, but it seemed to have been thrown into a black hole of public opinion",
      " As the saying goes, if there is an abnormality, there will be a demon, and this time is no exception",
      "The US made a simple and rude denial when the report was first released",
      " After that, it has kept silent",
      " European countries, as stakeholders, have mostly shunned commenting on the matter",
      " The oddest phenomenon is that the US mainstream media, which have been very sensitive to all kinds of clues, have maintained collectively silent",
      " In response, Hersh himself expressed disappointment, pointing out that not one of them has written a word about the pipelines, or even quoted the White House's denial of his report",
      " It's been almost a month, how long will the West continue to play dumb?Some say Hersh's report cites anonymous sources and lacks sufficient evidence, therefore, the US and Western media dare not to follow up",
      " This is untenable and they think too highly of the US and Western media",
      " Compared with Hersh's detailed investigative report, major US media outlets have published countless unreliable reports without any hesitation or psychological burden",
      " For instance, the Wall Street Journal recently hyped a \"low confidence\" report on virus origins tracing",
      " A more convincing explanation is that they all know the waters here are too deep, so they chose to \"wisely\" avoid it",
      "The performance of the US and Western media once again illustrates that their so-called independence and professionalism are selective",
      " It's not just the US and Western media, but almost the entire Western world is very passive in seeking the truth behind the Nord Stream bombing",
      " At a recent related UN meeting, the UK showed \"tolerance,\" holding that more investigations are unnecessary and claiming it was unclear why the Russian Federation is suddenly pursuing the issue with such urgency",
      " Many countries including Germany, one of the biggest victims of this incident, has yet to make a public statement",
      "Throughout the Western world, they are even afraid to mention Hersh's name, not to mention questioning him",
      " This is quite abnormal",
      "The Nord Stream bombing is an extreme international political event",
      " If such a big issue is deliberately covered up by some countries and ends up being in a confusing state with no consequences for those responsible, the harm will be more than damage to the interests of the victims",
      " More and more evidence shows that the Nord Stream sabotage was a deliberate act, and from the perspective of physical conditions, it is difficult to imagine that non-state actors are capable of carrying out such destruction alone",
      " From the perspective of the common interests of the international community, the consequences of the Nord Stream sabotage will be intensified and enlarged, further lowering the bottom line of the way of great power competition",
      " In short, if a country can bomb the Nord Stream pipelines today, it may destroy undersea cables tomorrow, and the security of global infrastructure will be severely threatened, which is terrifying to the whole world",
      "The world is facing such risks",
      " A balloon made Washington to act like a startled bird, while Hersh's report has been collectively ignored in the Western world",
      " This is chilling",
      " At a public meeting held by the Security Council in September last year, many countries called for an investigation into the incident to uncover the truth and identify those responsible",
      " We believe that conducting an objective, fair and professional investigation is not only necessary but also urgent, which is closely related to the interests and concerns of each country",
      " The international community should make concerted efforts on this issue",

      " Photo: Courtesy of Li YunChinese and Russian naval forces successfully concluded their week-long routine joint drills in the East China Sea on Tuesday, with Chinese navy commanders revealing to the Global Times that actual combat performances and innovation were highlights during the exercise, which focused on joint maintenance of maritime security",
      "Chinese naval forces from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern and Northern theater commands, including the Type 052D destroyer Baotou, the Type 052C destroyer Jinan, the Type 054A frigates Binzhou and Yancheng, the Type 903A comprehensive supply ship Gaoyouhu, as well as a submarine, fixed wing early warning aircraft, anti-submarine patrol aircraft and vessel-borne helicopters, participated in the Joint Sea 2022 from December 21 to 27, the Global Times has learned",
      "According to the Russian press release, the Russian Navy sent the guided missile cruiser Varyag, the frigate Marshal Shaposhnikov and the Project 20380 corvettes Hero of the Russian Federation Aldar Tsydenzhapov and Sovershennyy, as well as aircraft and helicopters belonging to the naval aviation forces under the Russian Pacific Fleet",
      "Joint Sea 2022 marks the 10th anniversary since the first drills in this series took place in 2012, and the latest naval drill consolidated experience and partnership between the two militaries over the past decade, the Global Times learned from Chinese officials",
      "Focusing on joint maintenance of maritime security, the two naval forces worked and coordinated with each other with solidarity, overcoming adversity created by bad weather",
      " The exercise involved joint operations on blockade and control, visits, boarding, search and seizure (VBSS), air defense, rescue, anti-submarine and other mock situations",
      " Life-fire shooting of main battle weapons including air defense missiles and rocket depth charge were also rehearsed",
      "The joint operations were conducted under rotational guidance or joint direction from two sides",
      "Shao Jianpeng, captain of the Type 054A frigate Binzhou which participated in the joint drills, revealed that during the air defense practice, China and Russia both sent out their elite warships, forming an air defense formation and working closely under seamless command to effectively cope with a variety of threats",
      "Shao said that it is safe to say that the drills showcased the most advanced air defense capability to date belonging to the two sides, as well as the great combat abilities and military skills of the two naval forces",
      "The steering rooms of Chinese destroyer Jinan and Russian guided missile cruiser Varyag were set as the main venues for the closing ceremony of Joint Sea 2022 on Tuesday morning",
      " Other ships and crews participated in the event via audio link",
      "Rear Admiral Wang Yu, the executive director of Joint Sea 2022 from the Chinese side, announced the start of the closing event at around 9:30 am",
      "In the past seven days, military officers from both sides smoothly completed all the set practice goals, and the joint drill has deepened cooperation and friendship between the two sides and boosted overall capabilities",
      "Wang stressed that \"as the relations between the two countries and militaries grow deeper and deeper, the prospect of pragmatic cooperation between the two naval forces will become broader",
      " And we shall certainly be more capable of making new and greater contributions to the cause of safeguarding world and regional peace",
      "\"The joint drills showcase the two countries' strength and resolve to safeguard peace and stability in the region, especially at a time when the US keeps promoting its \"Indo-Pacific Strategy\" and constantly increasing military deployment in the Western Pacific ocean, while Japan has broken away from its defense-only principle, provocatively instigating tensions over hotspot issues involving the Taiwan Straits, Korean Peninsula and the South China Sea, military expert Wei Dongxu told the Global Times on Tuesday",
      "Wei noted that the anti-submarine practice was one of the highlights during the Joint 2022, where the two sides could invest top-notch forces and their best weapons to carry out real combat-like adversarial practice, from which both sides could learn a lot",

      " The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) reported 28,475 new COVID-19 cases on March 8",
      " (Xinhua/Lo Ping Fai)Hong Kong will scrap mask mandate starting Wednesday after three years' fight against COVID-19, HKSAR Chief Executive John Lee announced on Tuesday, 958 days since the rule was imposed",
      "Following the lifting of the mandate, local residents will no longer need to wear masks indoors, outdoors and in public transportation, except in high-risk places such as nursing homes and hospitals",
      "The move was viewed as a step to achieve normalcy, showing greater openness to the world when the financial hub has launched a major push to welcome back global tourists and investors, also a necessary move following a stable COVID-19 and influenza trend",
      "The end of the mask mandate means the city ditched the last remaining social distancing measures, allowing the public to show their smile and say \"Hello Hong Kong\" to each other, Lo Chung-Mau, secretary of health of the HKSAR government, said at Tuesday's press conference",
      "Lo stated that the decision to remove the mask mandate was taken because of the overall situation of the controllable outbreak in Hong Kong, such as no signs of rising confirmed respiratory disease cases and no major outbreaks among schools",
      "The influenza height is also nearing its end",
      " Related positive cases can experience an upward trend when mask mandate is removed, but the risk is controllable, Lo noted",
      "The government did not want to lift the mandate too early for fear of a massive winter influenza outbreak that could overwhelm the public hospital system at the same as COVID-19, David Hui Shu-cheong, an expert advisor to the HKSAR government on COVID-19, told the Global Times on Tuesday",
      "Hong Kong accepts that COVID-19 has become endemic",
      " The overall vaccination rates are high enough, and many people in the community have been infected before, creating strong hybrid immunity in the community, Hui noted",
      "Though the city is about to scrap the mask mandate, masks are still required when entering medical institutions to protect high-risk populations and are recommended to be worn in stuffy places, Lo highlighted",
      "Lee also noted that people entering high-risk places such as nursing homes and hospitals will still be required to wear masks in an administrative and non-legal manner",
      "If there are outbreaks due to influenza or new COVID-19 variants in the community, then reintroducing the masking mandate outdoors would be necessary, Hui said",
      "The mask mandate came into effect on July 15, 2020",
      " Failure to abide by the rule was at risk of facing fines of up to HK$10,000 ($1,275)",
      "Hong Kong has gradually emerged from COVID-19",
      " The city resumed border exchange with the mainland on January 8 and then fully opened the border on February 6",
      " All international arrivals to Hong Kong will no longer be required to present vaccination records as Hong Kong fully reopens",
      "The lift of the mandate comes at a good time when Hong Kong has launched a campaign themed \"Hello Hong Kong\" this year to attract tourists from around the globe",
      " \"I believe that the city will be more prosperous and energetic in 2023,\" said the Chief Executive",
      "Starting from Monday, Macao also dropped its COVID-19 mask requirements for outdoor locations, except for public transportation, hospitals, and in some indoor places",
      "In the past three years, the mask was considered as one of the key social distancing measures to prevent and reduce the spread of the coronavirus",
      " Discussions over whether to scrap masks also rise as the mainland has overcome the height of COVID-19",
      "Health authorities had discussions about the end of wearing masks in Chinese cities but the final decision has yet to be made, a senior expert from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China's CDC) who prefer not to be named revealed to the Global Times",
      "China's health authorities currently hold a cautious attitude about it",
      " Chang Zhaorui from China CDC told a recent press conference on February 23 that wearing masks is still a necessary measure as part of personal protection as now is a high season for respiratory disease and sporadic COVID-19 cases are still occurring in some regions",

      "The implication of these long-range arms is that Ukraine will have the ability to carry out attacks deeper into Russian territory",

      " This could lead to another downward spiral for the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "According to AFP, Zelensky has agreed that weapons supplied by the West will not be used to attack Russian territory",
      "\"There is a consensus on this point,\" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in an interview with the German weekly Bild am Sonntag on Sunday",
      " He also said that such a consensus-based approach \"avoids escalation",
      "\"However, experts note that Scholz's remarks were more of an appeasement to Russia and an attempt to de-escalate tensions as it is unclear whether Ukraine will be able to keep its promise, experts warned",

      " Actually, this has surpassed the usual attempts and boundaries of aid,\" Zhang Hong, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "The so-called consensus to not attack Russia is also a message from Zelensky to Europe, Zhang said, noting that this is a \"guarantee\" of security for Europe",
      " However, now that the US has crossed a line by providing Ukraine with longer-range rockets, other countries may follow suit, which could cause a lot of troubles",
      "Experts also warned that as the two sides have different definitions of \"territory,\" it can be predicted that escalation is inevitable and intensity in fighting will increase",
      "Moreover, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine will not only escalate, but also threaten to spiral out of control",
      " This is decided by Russia's basic policy on nuclear safety, Zhang warned",

      "The spread of ideological radicalization from the US leaves European countries with no choice, experts warned",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/GTRecently, there has been much controversy in India surrounding a BBC documentary known as \"India: The Modi Question",
      "\" The documentary is a critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's purported role in sectarian riots which struck the Indian state of Gujarat in 2002 between Muslims and Hindus, where more than 1000 people died",
      " The program created outrage in India, which was denounced as \"propaganda and anti-India garbage\" that \"reflects BBC's colonial mindset\" by Kanchan Gupta, a minister in the information ministry",
      " It was subsequently banned thereafter",
      "Not long after, the BBC's offices in India were raided as part of a tax investigation by Indian authorities",
      " The broadcaster responded by insinuating that the probe was politically motivated, and emphasized that the BBC is \"independent\" and \"trusted",
      "\" From a Chinese perspective, these developments feel very familiar, as the BBC has also actively interfered in the country's internal affairs to push goals which were likewise ideological and geopolitical, with the broadcaster also taking a self-righteous position in response to criticism",
      "The BBC can't be trusted, and India's authorities are correct to label it as \"colonial propaganda,\" which as a lingering element of British Imperialism, sees itself as having a public duty to influence the country towards the \"correct course",
      "\" The BBC World Service of course, is neither impartial nor is to be trusted",
      " It was created to reassert British influence over former colonial nations following the decline of the empire, and during the tensions of the Cold War",
      " It operates under the jurisdiction of the British Foreign Office, who fund it and control its editorial processes external to British domestic regulations, where localized programming is monitored by Ofcom",
      "However, more important to the point, is the fact that these revelations show that India cannot trust the West as a long-term partner, especially if India's development pathway and national interests contravene their vision for what India should become",
      " In recent years, India is sometimes praised by Western commentators for being \"The world's largest democracy,\" which has attached an ideological character to Western countries' relationships with India, especially as a proposed alternative to China",
      " But this does not mean Western countries treat India as an \"equal,\" so to speak",
      "The West once held a similar attitude toward China",
      " In the early days of \"reform and opening up,\" in particular from the 1980s to the early 2000s, Western officials, scholars and commentators believed that China was on an inevitable path to liberalization and would conform to the Western model",
      " Therefore, their foreign policy toward China was cordial as this \"inevitable\" change made its political system tolerable",
      " However, when it became clear that China would not conform to the Western model, and would pursue its own development path, the West became hostile",
      " Both policies have been driven by the underlying assumption that China is never to be accepted \"on its own terms\" but rather those which the West have set for it",
      "Although India is not a Communist state, Western public opinion of India is closer to that of China in these earlier eras",
      " As a country that has been poorer, India is not viewed in \"threatening terms\" but seen as on a journey to \"become like the West\" and therefore needs the West's \"leadership and guidance",
      "\" As a former colonial power, the United Kingdom likewise views its relationship with India through the prism of Imperial nostalgia and still believes that it acted altruistically and India's benefit during the colonial era",
      " As such, the UK reserves the right, as it did with Hong Kong, to interfere in India's internal affairs and to set a \"parental expectation\" that the country must remain firmly on the liberal path",
      "However, when the time comes that India becomes an economic giant and a hugely successful nation, which challenges the West's monopoly, and likewise, should India make political choices that part it from the Western path of development, which is already happening to some extent on Modi, the West will begin to depict India as a threatening country",
      " Suddenly, India will be accused of human rights abuses and even genocide, it will face sanctions and embargos, and media such as the BBC will become even more hostile to India than they are already, as we see today with China",
      " Because of this, India will be wise not to \"put all its eggs in one basket,\" while the country needs capital and foreign investment to develop, and dreams to become a manufacturing powerhouse, allowing itself to become a \"Western backed puppet\" against China will ultimately damage India's strategic autonomy and independence",
      "New Delhi should know now that aligning with the West, comes with \"strings attached\", that is the long-term expectation you orient your political preferences and ideology to their vision",
      " A small country can of course get away with this, but not a country like India with over 1 billion people who could become a superpower beyond anything the West has seen before",
      " The West at large might overlook their political differences with Modi for now, but for how long? China was fine, until it wasn't",

      " US President Joe Biden Photo:AFPIn his most recent comments on the balloon farce, US President Joe Biden confirmed three objects shot down in North American airspace are not connected to China, but made \"no apologies\" for taking down the deviated Chinese airship while still seeking talks with China",
      " Analysts said as there have been no findings to support the spying accusations, Biden made the low-key speech in a bid to bring a soft landing to the balloon spat",
      " However, his ability to resist toxic anti-China sentiment in Washington and stop the deterioration in China-US relations remains a question",
      "Biden on Thursday made his most extensive remarks on the Chinese balloon and three unidentified objects downed by US fighters",
      " After saying that the most recent three objects appear to have been benign, Biden warned that if any object presents a threat to the safety and security of the American people, he \"will take it down",
      "\"While boasting about his decision to shoot down the Chinese balloon, Biden claimed the US was continuing to engage diplomatically with China on the issue and said he is not looking for a \"new cold war\" with China, but plans to continue pushing policies to compete with the country",
      "In response to Biden's remarks, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin reiterated on Friday that the Chinese airship's unintended entry into US airspace was an unexpected and isolated incident, but it tested the US' capability to properly manage crisis and sincerity about stabilizing relations with China",
      "The US cannot ask for dialogue and communication while at the same time escalating confrontation and crisis",
      " It should meet China halfway to manage differences, properly handle the unexpected isolated incidents, avoid misjudgments and work to bring bilateral relations back to the healthy and stable track, said Wang Wenbin",
      "The spat between China and the US around the balloon incident has continued",
      " Also on Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre claimed that China's sanctions against US defense contractors Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Missiles & Defense was to shift attention from the balloon incident, and criticized China for its \"irresponsible\" move",
      "In his response, Wang Wenbin said, \"Speaking of 'deflecting', can the US tell us why it is able to see the 'balloon' 18,000 meters in the sky, but seems to have been blind to the toxic mushroom cloud of vinyl chloride over Ohio? Why was it vocal about investigations and accountability immediately after the Nord Stream blast, and yet unusually silent in the wake of the latest investigative report written by a US journalist?\"\"What exactly were the three high-altitude objects it shot down? If the US does not consider the appearance of these objects in US airspace to be irresponsible, why jab its fingers at China? The US should not have overreacted and abused the use of force, still less use the incident for political manipulation or to smear and attack China,\" said the spokesperson",
      "Illustration: Liu Rui/GTNarrowing spaceBiden's Thursday speech was made as he faced increasing pressure in Washington to be more transparent about the situation around the Chinese balloon and the aerial objects, after confusing information from the military and the White House left not only Americans, but also the international community perplexed",
      " Compared to some anti-China hawkish \"China threat\" rhetoric, Biden's low-key speech aims to bring a soft landing to the balloon saga, analysts said",
      "However, as politicians in Washington seemed obsessed with anti-China sentiment, whether Biden is capable of avoiding further straining China-US relations amid the toxic political atmosphere remains a question",
      "Finding nothing to support its previous \"spying\" accusations after collecting and assessing the debris of the Chinese civilian airship that it shot down may be one reason why Biden kept the speech low-key, Sun Chenghao, a research fellow from the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times",
      "China and the US could have had better communication on the balloon incident, as it is by nature not a very significant issue",
      " But against the backdrop of intensifying China-US competition, some administrative departments that initially wanted to use the incident to push their strategy toward China found its side effects went out of control due to complicated domestic politics, Sun said",
      "The Biden administration may have been overconfident in its ability to set guardrails for China-US relations, and now realizes that once the irrational anti-China sentiment is fanned, any attempt to fix relations will be impeded, said Sun",
      "On February 9, the US House of Representatives unanimously backed a resolution condemning China for \"the incursion\" of the balloon into US airspace",
      " Republicans are also ramping up their criticism of the Biden administration's handling of the Chinese balloon, pushing the President to be harsher on China",
      "The US is split, as the administrative authority hopes to maintain communication and cooperation with China, push forward bilateral relations with a set agenda and deal with heated issues, such as the Ukraine crisis",
      " But some politicians, including Republicans, have different views and want to take the steering wheel, Zhang Jiadong, a professor at the Center for American Studies in Fudan University, told the Global Times",
      "Some officials from the Biden administration also expressed the importance of having communication with China and also hinted at a possible meeting between China's top diplomat Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Munich",
      " In a speech at the Brookings Institution, Blinken's deputy Wendy Sherman said, \"We have, we are and we will maintain open lines of communication\" with China so \"we can responsibly manage the competition between our countries",
      "\"Chinese analysts called on the Biden administration to take action instead of simply paying lip service",
      " Fixing China-US relations is a test of Biden's abilities and poses a severe challenge on how to avoid US diplomacy being taken hostage by political struggles, as some Republicans are pushing to provoke China, they said",
      "Republicans in Congress' foreign affairs and armed services committees are asking President Joe Biden to propose as much as $2 billion in military aid for the island of Taiwan when he releases his fiscal 2024 budget request, expected next month, media reported",
      " Meanwhile, the Pentagon's top China official, Michael Chase, has arrived in the island for a visit, the Financial Times reported, citing a source",
      "China-US relations were severely harmed after former House speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative visit to the island of Taiwan in August 2022",
      " China has reiterated its firm opposition to US' official exchanges with the island and asked the US to abide by its commitment",
      "There have been growing calls from around the world in recent days for China and the US to prevent the fallout from the incident to spiral out of control",
      " US former senior State Department official Chas Freeman was cited by media as saying that the US' hysterical overreaction to the Chinese balloon incident, including calling off a high-level diplomatic dialogue, shows the world that the Biden administration does not have sufficient strength and ability to engage Beijing constructively",
      "Zhang said that the international community does not want to see the deterioration of China-US relations while the Russia-Ukraine conflict is ongoing",
      " They are also witnessing which side is taking tangible actions in stabilizing relations, and which is not, he added",

      " Zhu fenglian Photo: VCGThe Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council on Wednesday urged the Taiwan island's secessionist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities to take practical measures and remove unilateral barriers to cross-Taiwan Straits exchanges, while stressing that the Chinese mainland will continue to promote the resumption and expansion of cross-Straits exchanges and cooperation in various fields",
      "In addressing the highly anticipated matter of the resumption of normal cross-Straits traffic, Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian said at a press briefing Wednesday that the mainland is well prepared to resume normal direct flights across the Taiwan Straits, without any restrictions or obstacles",
      "On February 1, the mainland proposed that direct cross-Straits flights resume to 16 destinations from the current four, given the easing COVID-19 situation and rising public sentiment",
      " Prior to the pandemic, direct cross-strait flights covered 51 destinations in the mainland and 10 destinations in Taiwan",
      "We hope that the Taiwan authorities can follow public opinion, take practical measures and stop using the epidemic as an excuse to block the resumption of normal direct flights across the Taiwan Straits, Zhu said",
      "Ferry services between Taiwan's outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu and the mainland's Fujian Province have continued this week, but the services are restricted to residents of the two islands, mainland spouses of Taiwan residents, and students studying in the two islands, media reported",
      "\"The epidemic on the mainland has been well put under control, and compatriots on both sides of the Straits have a strong desire for normal exchanges to resume,\" Zhu said",
      " \"Using the epidemic as an excuse to block cross-Straits exchanges runs counter to public opinion and is unpopular",
      "\"Zhu said that the mainland remains committed to the promotion of economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Straits and will continue to facilitate the import of Taiwan food products",
      "Zhu's remarks came at a time when members of Taiwan region's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party are embarking on a trip on the mainland from Wednesday to February 17 to consolidate exchanges and cooperation",
      "Zhu said on Monday that the mainland is willing to strengthen exchanges with the KMT and deepen exchanges and cooperation on the common political foundation of adhering to the 1992 Consensus and opposing Taiwan secession",
      "Wang Yingjin, director of the Center for Cross-Straits Relations Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the mainland is making great efforts for peaceful reunification, whether calling on the DPP not to put obstacles in the way of cross-Straits exchanges or discussing cross-Straits exchanges and cooperation with the KMT",
      "Cross-Straits people-to-people exchanges, dialogue and integrated development may be the focus of mainland efforts in 2023, but the first thing is to break the deadlock that the DPP authorities have created over the past three years with the epidemic as its shield",
      "According to Wang, both Tsai Ing-wen and the DPP are diving head first into an awkward dilemma",
      " On one hand, their pro-secession stance requires them to reject normal cross-Straits exchanges",
      " But they also fear a further loss of votes in the 2024 local elections in the face of public opinion on the island calling for peace and resumption of normal cross-Straits interaction",
      "As long as the DPP authorities recognize the 1992 Consensus, which embodies the one-China principle, and takes concrete actions to stop provocation seeking \"independence\" and collaborating with external forces against the mainland, cross-Straits dialogue and consultations can be resumed, Zhu said",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/Global TimesWith White House officials Tuesday calling on House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to \"come clean\" about secretive deals he made with hard-line House members that helped him eventually land the job, experts believe that the influence of a fundamental split within US political parties have begun to emerge, and that the polarization of US politics will make it difficult to sustain the two-party system",
      "US Republican Congressman Kevin McCarthy finally became Speaker of the House of Representatives on January 7 after a historic and embarrassing deadlock which took 15 rounds of voting that prevented the lower chamber from being fully functional for days after the new Congress convened",
      "Some media outlets revealed that McCarthy and the \"Freedom Caucus,\" the most conservative, far-right caucus of the Republican Party, reached \"secret agreements\" behind closed doors during the four days of drawn-out voting",
      "Addressing the details of these \"secret agreements,\" White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement released on Tuesday that \"an unprecedented tax hike on the middle class and a national abortion ban are just a glimpse of the secret, backroom deals Speaker McCarthy made with extreme MAGA members to end this month's chaotic elections and claim the gavel",
      "\" Bateman said \"it is well past time for Speaker McCarthy and the ultra MAGA Republican House members to come out of the dark and tell the American people, in-full, what they decided in secret",
      "\"While McCarthy insisted he made no formal agreements in exchange for getting conservative holdouts to vote for him, conservative members have said they received certain promises from the new speaker, Politico reported",
      "For 100 years, the election of the speaker was decided after a single round of voting, but this time, it took 15 to produce a result, L\u00fc Xiang, an expert on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday, noting that this can be seen as a prelude to a fundamental split in the Republican Party in the long run",
      "\"It shows that the two-party system can no longer function properly in the American political environment,\" L\u00fc said",
      "Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times that McCarthy's election came as a result of compromise within the Republican Party, but the battle between the two opposing parties in the US remains bitter, now and for some time to come, and will be difficult to reconcile",
      "The main reason is that the Republican Party refuses to compromise on the current distribution of power in the US, Li noted",
      " Such opposition has worsened the existing political environment in the US, greatly reduced the quality of American politics, and made social problems more serious and difficult to alleviate",
      "According to NBC News, McCarthy offered to lower the threshold to force a vote on ousting the House Speaker down to just one member",
      " In addition, McCarthy also promised to put more right-wing hard-liners on key House committees and vote on a series of conservative bills",
      "\"The few agreements we know about would fundamentally reshape our economy in a devastating way for working families and criminalize women for making their own healthcare decisions,\" Bates said",
      "In the future, US politics may lean toward a more European style with multiple parties contesting elections, L\u00fc said",
      " It is hard to sustain a functioning two-party system just by lumping people with totally different political views together",
      "McCarthy is expected make moves on a number of China-related issues, as he wants to cast more shadows and disrupt the Biden administration, experts pointed out",
      " McCarthy represents a more extreme group of lawmakers with no political experience and no boundaries, L\u00fc said",
      " Therefore, people will see the whole domestic atmosphere in the US will be clouded by China-related issues",
      "It is predictable that McCarthy's position will be precarious, and it will be difficult for him to do his job",
      " It is more likely that McCarthy will do something drastic to secure his position, such as compromising on domestic issues or shifting attention to China, Yuan Zheng, deputy director and a senior fellow of the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday",

      " Most critical of these are de-escalating to ceasefire, cautioning against the threat of nuclear weapons, peace talks, humanitarian relief and respect for national sovereignty",
      " These goals were welcomed almost immediately by Russia, which declared itself open to pursuing diplomatic and political routes to peace",

      "What is being proposed is not a solution, but a pathway towards finding a solution",
      " There will be no final outcome unless first steps are taken",
      " Those opposing the plan must know that, yet they still oppose it",
      " Do they want to weaken Russia with a prolonged conflict? Do they refuse to even try to seek peace, simply because the path is being shown by China, now so routinely demonised as the bogeyman of Western media that even the most outlandish criticism of it (such as preparing to supply weapons to Russia) is not challenged",

      "As the PLA Air Force's only female captain that is qualified to fly both the Y-20 large transport aircraft and the Y-9 medium-sized transport aircraft, NPC deputy Chen Jinlan said that pilots in active service and academies should enhance cooperation and personnel exchanges, so personnel training can be accelerated",
      "She urged that outstanding co-pilots should be directly promoted to captains if they are capable",
      "The goal is to form a transport aircraft fleet with excellent skills and tactical capabilities that can adapt to a variety of complex combat situations and combat systems, becoming a round-the-clock, comprehensively capable force that boosts the strategic transform of the PLA Air Force, Chen said",
      "Transport aircraft can rapidly set out, deliver cargos and then return, as they have the advantages of a long range, fast speeds and short time requirement, meaning that strategic transport capabilities can influence the entire situation on the battlefield, Chen said",
      "Chen said that the fleet's main mission is military airlift, including assisting all armed services in their rapid, forward deployment of personnel and equipment under highly dangerous conditions",
      " Transport aircraft will carry out reinforcement transport and equipment supply missions in short times, and send airborne troops, special forces and combat supplies to designated areas for fast, precision assaults",

      " Graphic:Global TimesChina on Sunday announced a draft budget for 2023 which will see the country's annual defense budget rise to 1",
      "5537 trillion yuan ($224",
      "79 billion), an increase of 7",
      "2 percent,remaining single-digit for the 8th consecutive year",
      " Analysts said that the figure marks a reasonable and restrained boost amid military spending sprees by many other countries around the world in light of global security tensions",
      "It is part of the country's efforts to meet the need of modernizing its national defense in order to safeguard national sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests facing external threats and instabilities",
      "The proposed defense budget growth was made public in a draft budget report issued at the opening of the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC), the country's top legislature, on Sunday",
      "It marks that China maintains a single-digit growth for defense budget for the eighth consecutive year since 2016, and a steadily increasing pace since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020",
      " The growth rate was 6",
      "6 percent in 2020, 6",
      "8 percent in 2021 and 7",
      "1 percent in 2022",
      "Experts said that the defense budget boost is reasonable due to the country's military modernization roadmap, the growing security threats in the world, as well as further optimized COVID-19 policies that encourage economic growth as well as more military diplomatic activities",
      "A 7",
      "2 percent increase in defense budget means only a 0",
      "1 percentage point higher compared with last year, and it is not high at all taking China's national defense needs and economic development into account, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "China's GDP growth rate in 2022 was 3 percent, so the defense budget growth is set to be restrained and reasonable, Song said",
      "China has set its GDP growth target at about 5 percent for 2023, which is significantly higher than the GDP growth rate of 3 percent in 2022, reflecting confidence in a nationwide economic recovery after claiming a decisive victory against the COVID-19 epidemic, and providing a basis for the defense budget increase, analysts said",
      "China is aiming to achieve the centenary goals of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) by 2027, basically realize the modernization of national defense and the armed forces by 2035, and fully build the armed forces into world-class forces by the mid-21st century, the Xinhua News Agency reported on August 1, 2022, which marks the 95th anniversary of the founding of the PLA",
      "To meet this roadmap, China needs to gradually increase its defense expenditure over many years as in tandem with the country's economic growth, a Beijing-based military expert told the Global Times on the condition of anonymity",
      "National defense modernization consists of mainly the development and procurement of new weapons and equipment, the maintaining of a high level of realistic combat-oriented exercises of the troops, as well as the improved welfare to military personnel, the expert said",
      "A J-20 stealth fighter jet performs during Airshow China 2022 in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province, on November 9, 2022",
      " Photo: Cui Meng/GTIn 2023, the PLA is expected to commission more advanced warplanes including J-20 stealth fighter jets and J-16 multirole fighter jets at a time when legacy J-7 fighter jets are being decommissioned, and conduct sea trials for the country's third aircraft carrier, the electromagnetic catapults-equipped Fujian",
      " It is also expected to hold more realistic combat-oriented drills that consume large amounts of costly live munitions and fuels, according to observers",
      "The significance of national defense modernization has become particularly highlighted due to the deteriorating global security situation over the past year, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the provocative visit of then US house speaker Nancy Pelosi to the island of Taiwan, which led to a series of unprecedented large-scale military exercises encircling the island",
      "The US and its allies including Japan have been provoking on the Taiwan question and potential military conflicts with China",
      " The US military frequently send aircraft and vessels to conduct close-in reconnaissance on China's doorsteps, sometimes trespassing into Chinese territorial waters in the South China Sea and provocatively transiting the Taiwan Straits, stirring up trouble",
      " Japan officially broke away from its post-WWII defense-only principle in 2022 and has begun to procure offensive missiles including US-made Tomahawks that could reach foreign countries",
      "The world today is facing challenges unseen in a century",
      " Under the current global security situation, China needs to allocate enough budgets to build a strong military and sufficient training to build up a credible deterrence to prevent conflicts from happening, win them if they take place, and safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, analysts said",
      "Photo: XinhuaNot in arms raceMany countries around the world are on military spending sprees in 2023, with the US topping the list with $817 billion budget for the Pentagon, more than three times than that of China",
      " Japan planned $51 billion defense budget, which is record-breaking 26",
      "3 percent higher than previous year",
      " India is expected to raise defense budget by 13 percent",
      " Other countries like the UK, France, Germany and Australia are also looking to boost defense spending, according to media reports",
      "But China is not participating in an arms race with other countries, observers said",
      "China's defense spending as a share of GDP has remained basically stable for many years, and it is lower than the world average and the increase is appropriate and reasonable, Wang Chao, spokesperson for the first session of the 14th NPC, made the remarks at a press conference on Saturday",
      "Observers said that China's defense budget has been kept less than 1",
      "5 percent over the recent years, while the world average is 2 percent, not to mention the US' figure that nears 4 percent",
      "China is fully capable of increasing this figure to 2 percent, but it chose not to significantly hike defense spending and acted in a restrained manner, showing that China's national defense development is proper and reasonable, and the country will not engage in an arms race with anyone on a path of peaceful development, Song said",
      " China follows a national defense strategy that is defensive in nature, he said",
      "Expressed in US dollars, China's planned defense budget for 2023, $224",
      "79 billion, is even less than 2022's $229 billion, which is another proof that China is not in an arms race with other countries, experts said",

      " Western military-industrial complex reaps huge wealth from the Ukraine Crisis",
      " Cartoon: Carlos LatuffAbout one year ago, Chinese people, just like almosteveryone else around the globe, were shocked by a massive military conflict that has profoundly changed international relations and the geopolitical landscape of Europe",
      " Unfortunately, this terrible tragedy between Russia and Ukraine is still far from being over",
      "From February 17 to 20, Global Times conducted an online survey that received 5,214 response samples from Chinese netizens around the globe, with more than 68",
      "16 percent of the participants saying the US is the one that \"bears primary responsibility and should be held accountable for the outbreak of the conflict,\" and 39",
      "24 percent believing that the conflict will continue for a longer term at its current intensity",
      "China is a country with a neutral stance and has not become directly involved in the conflict, but the other relevant parties, including Russia, Ukraine, France, Germany and the US, are all expecting China to play a bigger role to serve their demands for mediation or help them pressure their adversaries in this conflict",
      " The opinion of Chinese society is crucial for people to understand what China can and will do for a potential peaceful settlement of the conflict in the future",
      "Fair and neutral stanceMore than 84",
      "8 percent of the participants found that the Russia-Ukraine conflict has had very little or no impact at all on their daily lives, 64",
      "38 percent of them find that the biggest impact of the conflict is \"arguments between people with different views on the Russia-Ukraine conflict on social media platforms or in their real lives,\" and 45",
      "9 percent find the change in energy prices has impacted their living costs",
      "This shows that Chinese people are not like Europeans, who have been deeply impacted and concerned by the conflict in fields such as the refugee crisis, the energy and food crises, as well as the fear of escalation and potential nuclear conflict, said Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University",
      "\"This is why they [Chinese people] prefer to stay neutral and are able to be fair when observing the ongoing conflict from the perspective of an uninvolved third party,\" Li told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "US the troublemakerWhen asked about how to evaluate the role that the US has played in this conflict, more than 68",
      "16 percent of the participants said the US is the one that \"bears primary responsibility and should be held accountable for the outbreak of the conflict and the ensuing damage to the global industrial and supply chains",
      "\" Nearly 30 percent said although Washington did not actually start the conflict, the US has successfully usedthe conflictto maximize its own strategic interest, as it has seriously undermined Russia and the EU and brought a negative impact to the world economy and international security",
      "Some participants told the Global Times that they believe it was the US that has provoked the conflict, because Russia had repeatedly warned the West about NATO expansion, but the US just ignored the warnings, and even encouraged Kiev to challenge Moscow's bottom line on purpose by undermining the implementation of the Minsk agreement, leaving Russia with no choice but to take military measures to respond to the threat from the West",
      "They sympathize with the Ukrainian people but believe that Kiev has been used by Washington as a proxy to fight Moscow for as long as possible, which is why Russia and Ukraine have failed to implement their agreements reached in a series of peace talks in 2022, said some participants of the survey",
      "The Biden administration has benefited from the conflict in various ways, such as maintaining internal bipartisan unity on this issue amid intensifying partisan struggles, allowing the military-industrial complex to earn huge amounts of profits through expensive arm supplies to Ukraine, and worsening the business environment in Europe so as to force European companies to move their industries from Europe to the US",
      " These are some of the reasons why many netizens believe the US has played a destructive rather than constructive role in the conflict",
      "US the culprit",
      " Illustration: Liu Rui/GTThe latest report by Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist Seymour Hersh said the US Navy destroyed the Nord Stream pipeline under the Baltic Sea last September, cutting Russian gas supplies to Europe",
      " The suspicious attitude shown by the US and other Western countries to the report made more Chinese people believe that the US is the troublemaker that will do everything it can to disrupt any possibility of peace based on independent and pragmatic decision-making between the major EU countries and Russia",
      "Experts said China is facing a similar threat from the US in Asia to what Russia has seen in Europe in past decades",
      " Based on facts such as the formation of the AUKUS alliance and the Quad mechanism, they believe Washington is trying to replicate bloc-to-bloc confrontation in Asia by forming and strengthening its alliance to contain China",
      " The US has also ignored China's warnings against challenging its core interests like the Taiwan question again and again by continuing arms sales and sending senior officials to encourage secessionist forces on the Taiwan island",
      "Additionally, the Chinese people have seen many cases of the US trying to undermine China's relations with other regional countries and create conditions to further worsen regional security in the Asian-Pacific region, so it's very natural for Chinese people to understand Russia's situation in Europe, experts noted",
      "Over 72 percent of participants said \"the US involvement makes Kiev unable to make decisions independently, and the Nord Stream pipeline explosions have cut off ties between Russia and major EU countries, and the US and NATO want to draw out the conflict",
      "\"On this matter, the survey shows that the Chinese people and the government share the same judgment",
      " Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, \"Despite multiple rounds of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine last year, the peace talks ended without any result",
      "\"We are not aware of the reasons behind it",
      " It seems some forces might not wish to see successful peace talks or an end to the conflict, Wang said",
      "Those forces \"do not care about the lives of the Ukrainian people, nor the damage taken by Europe,\" Wang said, adding that they have a larger strategic goal",
      "Wang didn't name who the \"forces\" are, but analysts said the answer is clear: The key to ending the conflict is in the hands of Washington",
      "Long-term conflictThe survey showed that 39",
      "24 percent of the respondents believe that the conflict will continue for the long term at its current intensity, and 37",
      "17 percent believe that some negotiations will take place when both sides get tired and can no longer afford the long-term conflict, but small conflicts will remain and negotiations won't bring peace immediately",
      "Over 17 percent of participants believe that \"Russia will win the war eventually and its strategic goals will be realized, and the security landscape of Europe will be profoundly changed,\" and 4",
      "51 percent believe NATO will eventually get involved directly, and Europe will face \"the danger of another World War",
      "\" About 0",
      "9 percent believe Ukraine could win the war, and only 0",
      "8 percent believe Russia's nuclear weapons will be used in Ukraine if Russian troops are defeated by Ukrainian forces",
      "Although more people believe Russia has the clear advantage, 52",
      "71 percent said that after 12 months of conflict, Russia's status as a \"major world military power\" is wavering, and the military performance of Russian forces in the battlefield has been somewhat \"disappointing",
      "\" Over 23 percent of them said the war has reflected Russia's real military capability, while 18",
      "58 percent said \"Russian forces are still powerful, but just made some mistakes in strategic judgment and intelligence at the very beginning",

      " Photo: VCGThe discovery of a US sail drone in Namibian territorial waters signified the increasing tendency of US spying in every corner of the world and countries should be vigilant as US investment in intelligence globally will pose a bigger threat, analysts said",
      " Local media outlets reported that the Namibian military confirmed a sail drone had been found in waters near L\u00fcderitz and that it was controlled by the US",
      "A Namibian tour operator based in the southern coastal town, who was allegedly hired by the American controller of the drone to bring the device ashore for repairs, was called in for questioning by the military, local media outlet Erongo 24/7 reported last week",
      "Two South African men - one with Namibian citizenship - were found at their hotel last week after it emerged they were sent by the American controller to repair the drone in Namibia",
      " The two men entered the country as \"tourists,\" military sources told the Namibian Sun",
      "Namibia Defense Force (NDF) spokesperson Colonel Petrus Shilumbu confirmed the incident, but was not willing to share further details",
      " A sail drone is an unmanned sailboat-like craft designed to gather data \"in the most remote regions of the ocean and in the harshest conditions,\" Erongo 24/7 reported",
      "The US government has tried to distance itself from reports about the sail drone",
      " Tiffany Miller, spokesperson for the US Embassy in Namibia, said in a statement that the US was not involved with the drone",
      "The statement said that although the drone was made and operated by Saildrone, a private US company, the University of Gothenburg in Sweden had contracted the drone for marine research purposes",
      "A local media report in Namibia, citing a military source, said it was suspected that the drone had been at sea for six months, especially in western areas of the coast",
      " The NDF accused the tour operator, whose name was withheld due to the ongoing investigation, of \"compromising national security",
      "\"Although the US Embassy in Namibia said it had nothing to do with the drone, some suspicions still linger",
      " \"This shows that the US has no credibility,\" Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "Many monitoring and investigation activities in the US are carried out in the guise of research by private institutions and firms",
      " Therefore, even if the US embassy has relevant explanations, it cannot dispel everyone's doubts, Li said",
      "\"It's not good if the US doesn't say anything about the matter, but if the US speaks, people don't trust it any more, which is a very interesting paradox that the US is currently facing in the international community,\" Li noted",
      "The geographic location of Namibia may have appealed to the US in collecting intelligence and conducting spying activities as it is a strategic pass between the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean",
      " South Africa is its neighbor to the south",
      " The US has intensified its activities in Southwest Africa, which is closely related to its Indo-Pacific Strategy",
      " The US will not admit its spying activities but the Namibia military will not have groundless doubts, L\u00fc Xiang, research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times",
      "Namibia is not the key country for US eavesdropping and spying activities, but the spy sail drone found in the African country's waters signified an increasing tendency in US spying activities globally, said L\u00fc",
      "L\u00fc said that spying activities are part of the so-called US strength and \"unmanned\" and \"stealth\" are the key words for its latest technologies in the field",
      " The US spies on other countries, especially when it feels allies are not reliable and rivalries become stronger",
      "The US is still in the leading position in information technology and its increasing investment in the intelligence field will pose a greater threat to countries around the world, L\u00fc said, while calling for vigilance",
      "Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin also told a press conference on Tuesday that the US is the number one country in the world in terms of surveillance",
      "The Danish media reported that the US National Security Agency (NSA), while partnering with Denmark's foreign intelligence unit, spied on leaders of Germany, Sweden, Norway and France, including former German Chancellor Angela Merkel",
      " Since the 1970s, the CIA has secretly rigged Crypto AG, a Swiss manufacturer of encryption machines to eavesdrop on countries around the globe",
      "The rigged encryption devices sold to over 120 countries were in fact used by the CIA to eavesdrop on secret communications",
      " According to a report released by the Beijing-based Qi An Pangu lab, the hacking group under the NSA, called Equation, has been running a backdoor cyber attack operation called \"Telescreen\" against 45 countries and regions, including China, Russia, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands",
      " The operation covers communications, research institutions, and economic and military sectors",

      " Illustration:Xia Qing/GTThe release of China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis triggered immediate reactions from the US and its allies",
      " NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg claimed that China doesn't have \"much credibility\" in the Russia-Ukraine war; US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the proposal should only include the appeal for \"respecting the sovereignty of all countries",
      "\" The EU would consider China's proposals \"against the backdrop that China has taken sides,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen",
      " It is obvious that the US and its allies are concerned about China's attitude on this issue",
      " However, it is unreasonable to misinterpret Chinese proposals maliciously through groundless criticisms and accusations",

      " To this end, the US and its NATO allies have no right to point finger with relevant claims and smears",
      "The Ukraine crisis is the product of the deep-rooted Cold War mentality of some countries, and China has been seeking for an ultimate \"antidote",
      "\" Ukraine's geographical location and geopolitical situation have made it a place of strategic importance for neighboring powers",
      " Weaponizing such a Cold War mentality, the US has been advancing the expansion of NATO to the east in pursuit of its own hegemony",
      " Hence, taking seriously of and addressing properly the legitimate security interests and concerns of all countries, and following the vision of a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, is the key to resolving the conflict in Ukraine as well as similar conflicts",
      "As the Ukraine crisis faces potential escalation, the risk of nuclear war is rising",
      " In this context, China stressed the necessity to \"reduce strategic risks,\" and clarified that \"dialogue and negotiation are the only viable solution to the Ukraine crisis",
      "\" China's position and attitude are truly for the sake of the development and stability of the world and in line with the interests and aspirations of the majority",
      "Given there is still a long way to go for a political solution, China offers constructive ideas about the crisis",
      " All parties should strictly abide by universally recognized international law, including the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and take various measures to relieve the loss and damage caused by the conflict",
      " For one thing, resolving the humanitarian crisis, the safety of civilians and prisoners must be effectively protected to prevent a humanitarian crisis on a larger scale, so that create conditions for peace talks",
      " For another, facilitating grain exports and keeping industrial and supply chains stable, all parties should earnestly maintain the existing world economic system to boost global economic recovery",
      "After China published the \"position paper\", the US and its allies have kept a close watch on China's attitude",
      " However, Beijing's proposal has been misinterpreted with ill-intentioned and partial blames",
      "It is a consistent and long-standing position of China calling for respecting national sovereignty and opposing unilateral sanctions",
      " On the contrary, the US totally overrides Ukraine's national sovereignty and the human rights of its people, and only sees it as a tool for geopolitical competition",
      "China has always held an impartial position on the Ukrainian crisis and called on all parties to abide by international law and the UN Charter and to resolve disputes and conflicts in a peaceful and political manner",
      " China maintains friendly relations with both Russia and Ukraine, and China's position has been recognized by massive peace supporters",
      "China is not a party directly involved in the Ukrainian crisis",
      " In contrast, the US and NATO hold the \"steering wheel\" that determines the destiny of Ukraine",
      "Against this backdrop, the US and NATO, instead of reflecting on the adverse impact on the regional and international situation, are keen to point fingers at China's good intentions and sense of responsibility, with the aim of diverting attention, confusing the public, and providing excuses for their unjust actions",
      " The US and NATO intend to create international divisions and bloc confrontations by coercing other countries to take sides",
      " Moreover, they throw mud at China in an attempt to exert pressure, while muster allies to implement the \"dual containment\" strategy against China and Russia",
      "The US, with its current power and discourse strength, has been drawing in NATO and other allies with a Cold War mentality and inciting bloc confrontation in pursuit of its own interests",

      " A Washington Post report recently revealed that the Pentagon is urging Congress to resume funding for a pair of top-secret programs in Ukraine",
      " If approved, the move would allow American Special Operations troops to employ Ukrainian operatives to observe Russian military movements and counter disinformation",
      "Despite the strong support of the US and the West, Ukraine cannot gain a decisive advantage on the battlefield",

      " Without further intervention from the US, it will obviously feel the pressure to deal with military action from Russia",
      "Under such circumstances, that a US mainstream media outlet revealed the resumption of US secret programs in Ukraine sends a strong political signal - the US is determined to retain the Kiev government so that it could control the intensity of the conflict in the next stage, international relations experts noted",
      "However, it also further proves Ukraine's role as a proxy",
      " It is no secret that the US achieves its geopolitical goals through proxy wars",

      " All of these require Ukrainian special operations forces to use US equipment and observe according to US thinking",
      " The US may conduct professional training for Ukrainian personnel, or send its own personnel to participate in the project",
      " This turns indirect participation into direct participation, but still uses Ukrainian special operations forces as a cover to hide the real goal of its intervention, which is to weaken Russia",
      "It is impossible for Ukraine itself to achieve a so-called victory on the Russia-Ukraine battlefield",
      " Without the support and help of the US and NATO, Ukraine would not have been able to confront Russia for so long",
      " If the US wants to weaken Russia, it must increase its understanding of Russia's actual combat power, find out the weaknesses and shortcomings of Russia's combat power, and then let the Ukrainian army take military actions against Russia's shortcomings",

      " We do not know who owns it, whether it's state-owned or corporate-owned or privately owned",
      " We just don't know",
      "\" Yet he did mention that the object was \"much, much smaller than the spy balloon that we took down last Saturday",
      "\"The explanation tells the story",
      " The shooting down of the object can be argued as Biden's attempt to reverse the tide of criticisms against his administration for taking down the Chinese balloon too late",
      " This time, Biden wants to showcase that he can make a decisive and timely action, even without knowing almost anything",
      " This is juvenile",
      "\"It was a success,\" Biden told reporters about the military operation by an F-22 fighter plane to down the object",
      " But there is really nothing to brag about when US fighter aircraft brought down either an \"object\" or a balloon",
      " The techniques for such missions at an altitude of over 10,000 meters above sea level are relatively easy",
      " That being the case, instead of making the US Air Force look mighty, the missions only made the US a laughingstock",
      " The US did make a strong case that the F-22 is invincible, when its enemy are balloons",
      "As a matter of fact, there are a large number of meteorological balloons in operation across the globe",
      " Some are from civilian enterprises and some are from state-owned research institutions",
      " But they are not for military use",
      " Balloons can in no way threaten US national security",
      " It is too exaggerated a move to shoot them down",
      " Moreover, this reckless action will create stumbling blocks to certain scientific explorations",
      "US Congress, political and academic circles, even the military, seem to be panic-stricken by whatever that might have a slightest connection with China",
      " Everything from China can pose a threat to US national security",
      " And they can even make groundless accusation against China for \"object\" they don't even know who owns it yet",
      " The US needs the stuff to keep Americans nervous and angry at China to justify its goal of confronting China",
      " So the US makes a big deal out of trivial issues every once in a while",
      "That why we are seeing some US experts, including American scholar Bonnie Glaser, have started to hype about the downed object",
      " \"If this is a PRC spy platform, we are in for a very rough ride,\" Glaser tweeted on Saturday",
      "It's an old habit of quite a few US pundits - wasting no time to blame China for everything that might be negative",
      " They are so used to pounding war drums over the \"China threat theory,\" how can they possibly take time to consider facts and science? They are not real experts, they are pawns of the US establishment",
      "Be it the Chinese balloon or the unidentified object, the US made its move out of political infighting, as well as the attempt to pump up US' credibility among allies",
      " The White House was showing its allies this message: You see, how determined and forceful I am in the face of unidentified, yet possibly threatening object?How ridiculous",
      " Shooting down a balloon or a smaller object is no feat worth celebrating",
      " This is not an anti-missile or an anti-asteroid mission",
      " People may give a thumb-up if it intercepts a hypersonic weapon, or an asteroid",
      " Yet what can Washington prove by intercepting a bunch of balloons? Nothing other than its ignorance and incompetence",
      " Unfortunately, this is the way the US propagandizes - bragging about shooting down balloons",
      "The US has the opportunity to confront Russia on the battlefield",
      " But it keeps stepping back, confirming it supports Ukraine but will not get involved in a direct confrontation with Russia",
      "Is US strong or weak? It looks pretty damn tough in the face of balloons, civilian airships, and other innocuous objects",
      " But in the face of real battlefield, US' choice is to exhaust others",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/Global TimesAlthough Japan's plan to dump nuclear-contaminated water into the sea has been strongly opposed by the international community, Tokyo is still going its own way and speeding up the plan to make the rest of the world pay for it",
      "According to the Japan Times, government sources said on Wednesday that Japan will seek the endorsement of the G7 nations for its plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water from its crippled nuclear power plant in Fukushima Prefecture into the Pacific Ocean when it hosts a meeting of the group's energy ministers in April",
      "On March 11, 2011, a 9",
      "0-magnitude earthquake occurred off the coast of northeastern Japan and triggered a tsunami, resulting in a nuclear leak at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant",
      " Faced with many options for dealing with nuclear-contaminated water, the Japanese government chose to dump it in the ocean because it takes the shortest time and costs the least",
      "Japan's attempt to draw other G7 members over to its side is through hosting a G7 meeting, a platform where it is easiest to reach consensus",
      " Tokyo's aim is very obvious",
      " This is also a kind of public opinion manipulation to cover up its own wrongdoing",
      "Dumping nuclear-contaminated water into the sea has not only sparked controversy within the country, but also met with strong opposition from neighboring countries such as China, South Korea, and Russia",
      " Therefore, Tokyo wants the Western camp to endorse it in order to find legitimacy for its actions",
      "If the \"treated water\" claimed by the Japanese government is really safe, why is it being dumped into the Pacific Ocean? Today, when water resources are so tight, the Japanese government can use \"treated water\" for irrigation, breeding, or other purposes",
      " Similarly, the Japanese government insists that the dump of nuclear-contaminated water is under the supervision of the international community, but why did it arbitrarily decide before the International Atomic Energy Agency completed its supervision? Tokyo's guilt is self-evident",
      "After the Fukushima nuclear disaster, China, Russia, South Korea, and other countries were the first to give Japan a helping hand",
      " However, Japan returned their kindness by ignoring the lives, health, and safety of people in neighboring countries",
      "The US, which claims human rights come first, is turning a blind eye to Japan's move",
      " The US is also a victim of the accident",
      " A large amount of pollutants have drifted from west to east to the US coast due to ocean circulation along the North Pacific Current",
      " Nevertheless, in order to maintain the alliance between the US and Japan and achieve the goal of dominating East Asia, Washington continues to tolerate Tokyo",
      "Indeed, it is not just the US that turns a blind eye to Japan on certain issues; Japan does the same with the US on many things",
      " For instance, the whole world is paying close attention to whether Washington planned the Nord Stream explosion, but the Japanese government, which has always been actively involved in international affairs, has kept a low profile this time",
      " In a sense, Japan and the US are covering up each other's scandals",
      " In order to maintain the bond of the so-called alliance between them, they do not hesitate to ignore facts and violate science",
      "After the nuclear-contaminated water is dumped into the sea, it will quickly spread to most parts of the Pacific Ocean, thereby affecting the global oceans",
      " According to marine biologists, radiation will be absorbed by marine organisms and enter the human body along the food chain, which is a major threat to the Pacific Rim countries and the ecosystem on which all human beings depend",
      "It is not a matter that relates to a single country",
      " Rather, it is a matter of the security of neighboring countries and sustainable security of the international sea food chain, and the health of future generations",
      " Therefore, it deserves high attention from the international community",
      " Some said Japan's dumping of nuclear-contaminated water has got the approval from its big brother, the US",
      " However, this is both a scientific and humanitarian issue",
      " Japan should explain it to the world, not Washington, in an open and transparent manner",
      " It should also work with relevant international organizations and scientists from neighboring countries",
      "G7 are not in a position to give scientific evaluation of Japan's discharge of Fukushima contaminated water",
      " If they do agree on a statement that endorses Japan's plan, they have to bear the responsibilities for what Japan should bear",
      "Japan's attempt to mislead international public opinion and woo the Western bloc is irresponsible and will not work",
      " Japan is not only dumping nuclear-contaminated water, but also its morality too",
      " A Japan that tampers with its history of aggression, a Japan that disrupts the international order, and a Japan that harms the homeland of mankind, will never be able to stand up with dignity",

      " Japan's nuclear regulator on July 22, 2022 approved the dumping of the water into the sea, despite international concerns and protests",
      " Photo: VCGAmid backlash from domestic and the international community, the Japanese government reportedly is to seek the endorsement of the Group of Seven (G7) nations for its controversial plan to discharge radioactive contaminated wastewater from the crippled nuclear power plant in Fukushima Prefecture into the Pacific Ocean",
      " Analysts criticized countries that are giving a go-ahead signal to Japan's irresponsible dumping plan, noting they will share the shame of making irreversible damage to maritime environment and human health",
      "As this year's chair, Japan is seeking to include a phrase that says the G7 members \"welcome\" its \"transparent\" approach toward the disposal of the treated water in a document to be released after the April 15 to 16 gathering in Sapporo, Japanese media Kyodo News reported citing government sources",
      "In January, the Japanese government and the plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, announced the plan to begin discharging the treated water around this spring or summer, with construction work underway to install an undersea tunnel and other necessary facilities",
      "Analysts said that Japan has beefed up efforts in soliciting support from the US and Western countries for its disposal of the Fukushima radioactive contaminated wastewater and in promoting its narrative of the \"safety\" of the wastewater amid growing oppositions from domestic public, neighboring countries and other stakeholders",
      "Against the backdrop of the Ukraine crisis and current tense Korean Peninsula situation, Japan is working to create the momentum for its dumping plan especially among Western countries as other G7 nations are also members of NATO and the military pact is seeking closer cooperation with Japan, Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at the Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times",
      "This is not the first time for Japan to try to include the Fukushima nuclear wastewater issue into the G7 declaration",
      " In May 2016, after the Ise-Shima Summit in Japan, the G7 Leaders' Declaration wrote about \"steady progress on decommissioning and treatment of contaminated water\" as well as \"Japan's efforts to proceed in an open and transparent manner in close communication with the international community",
      "\"The US also expressed support for its close ally in Asia",
      " In April 2021, after the Japanese government mentioned the plan to release more than 1 million metric tons of treated radioactive water, the US Department of State said in a statement that Japan \"appears to have adopted an approach in accordance with globally accepted nuclear safety standards",
      "\"However, fancy words from the US and the G7 cannot gloss overthe increasing questions over the safety of the \"treated\" wastewater, the transparency of Japan's processing of the contaminated water and its consultations on the disposal with related neighboring countries, analysts said",
      "Pacific island nations also urged Japan to delay the release of the contaminated water over fears fisheries will be contaminated and that the health of people will be affected",
      " For example, during a livestreamed public meeting in Suva, Fiji on January 18, the Pacific Island Forum Secretary General Henry Puna said, \"Our region is steadfast that there be no discharge until all parties verify it is safe",
      "\"At the Security Council session on February 14 over Japan's discharge of nuclear-contaminated water, both representatives from China and Russia expressed concerns over the issue",
      " Ambassador Zhang Jun, Permanent Representative of China to the UN, made China's position clear, stressing that \"Japan's discharge of nuclear contaminated water into the sea will severely endanger the global marine environment, ecosystems, and the lives and health of people of all countries",
      "\"\"Japan has been bent on forcibly approving the discharge program of the nuclear contaminated water and has been accelerating the preparations for the discharge",
      " Such behavior is extremely irresponsible,\" said Zhang",
      "Lingering threatsThe Japanese government sees the plan of dumping the contaminated water into the ocean as the most \"economic\" way to get rid of the burden from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant",
      " But people in Japan, neighboring countries and the world will pay the price given the irreversible damage to environment and human health, Zhou Yongsheng, deputy director of the Japanese Studies Center at China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times",
      "The Japanese government will be condemned and held accountable if it irresponsibly discharges contaminated nuclear wastewater into the ocean and countries that give green light to Tokyo's moves will also share the shame, said Zhou",
      "Concerns expressed by UN human rights experts, global nongovernmental organizations and activists from all over the world and their own countries may make G7 countries to consider more than only political leverage, analysts said",
      "As far back as 2021, independent experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council have expressed deep regret on Japan's decision to release contaminated water into the ocean",
      "They noted that the water processing technology known as ALPS had failed to completely remove radioactive concentrations in most of the contaminated water stored in tanks at the Fukushima Daiichi plant",
      " The radioactive hazards of tritium in the water, which cannot be removed, have been underestimated and can be detrimental to humans and pose threat to the environment for over 100 years",
      "Japanese fisheries and Japanese people will be the first to be affected and the whole world will also suffer as oceans are linked",
      " If the US and other G7 nations are the real protectors of the environment and human rights as they like to trumpet, they should have opposed Japanese government's transboundary environmental harms, said Zhou",
      "As Japanese activists have staged protests against the government's discharge plan for years, analysts called on more countries to join them and the neighboring countries in urging the Japanese government to stop making irreparable damage to the world",

      "For the first time, China's Poly Technologies Inc brought a genuine A45 unmanned combat boat, together with other advanced surface drones including the A300 unmanned mine-hunter boat and the A2000 unmanned multirole boat, to the 16th International Defense Exhibition and Conference (IDEX 23), which is being held from Monday to Friday in Abu Dhabi, the maker of the unmanned surface vehicles said in a press release sent to the Global Times",
      "Making dynamic demonstrations at the expo, the A45 sailed in narrow water lanes, displayed its capabilities in autonomous obstacle evasion, close-in reconnaissance and target tracking, winning praise from visitors for its full autonomy, accurate controls and good human-machine interactivity, according to the press release",

      " The ship drone can adapt to sea state 4, and can operate fully autonomously, semi-autonomously, through remote control or manually, its maker said",
      "The drone can be equipped with optical and electronic sensors, radar systems, guns and missile launchers, and it can be deployed for alert patrols, as well as reconnaissance and precision strike missions around islands, reefs and maritime borders as an armed reconnaissance ship drone",
      "It can also provide fire support to naval forces by blocking small to medium-sized maritime targets from approaching",
      "With technological breakthroughs in communications, sensors, target identification and image processing, China has made huge strides in the field of unmanned vessels",

      " Observers say it could be China's next-generation carrier-based fighter jet",
      " Photo: Screenshot of the PLA Navy promotional videoThe Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy on Monday released a promotional video aiming to recruit more pilots for its aircraft carriers, following recent policy changes that will see female cadets and students from civilian colleges and universities participate in the recruitment in 2023 for the first time",
      "It also gave the first official glimpse at what observers said could be China's next-generation carrier-based stealth fighter jet",
      "The promotional video, titled \"Pursuing Dreams in the Sky Above the Sea,\" is released as the PLA Navy's annual pilot recruitment procedure started for 2023, the PLA Navy said on Tuesday on its social media account",
      "In 2023, the PLA Navy will for the first time recruit female carrier-based aircraft pilots and select students outside of military academies for this position, and it will also for the first time hold 15-hour flight tests for the recruits, the PLA Navy said",
      "At the end of the promotional video, a pilot was given \"a new mission with new challenges,\" after which he walked toward an aircraft",
      "The camera focused on the pilot, so the aircraft was blurred, but observers were able to tell its clear difference from the PLA Navy's current J-15 carrier-based fighter jet",
      " This comparison can be easily drawn because a J-15 could be seen next to this blurred aircraft in the video",
      "Despite the blurred frame, the general aerodynamic design of this aircraft shows that it is a stealth fighter jet, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday",
      "The wings of the blurred aircraft are seemingly folded, which is a significant characteristic of being a carrier-based aircraft, Song said",
      "Although blurred, it is the first time the PLA Navy has officially given the public a glimpse of its next-generation aircraft, observers said",
      "At Airshow China 2021 held in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province in September, Sun Cong, chief designer of the J-15, said at a press conference that good news on the next-generation carrier-based fighter jet would come out later that year",
      "In October 2021, foreign media outlets reported that a prototype of a carrier-based stealth fighter jet, rumored to be designated the J-35, had made its maiden flight",
      " The reports said the J-35 was developed based on China's second stealth fighter jet, the made-for-export FC-31, with analysts saying it could rival the US' F-35",
      "Song said that the alleged J-35, which is not confirmed by Chinese military authorities, is expected to operate together with the J-15 to maximize their combat capabilities, just like the US Navy's combination of the F-35C and the F/A-18E/F",
      "The new fighter jet will likely operate not only on China's third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, but also on the Liaoning and the Shandong, Song said",
      "After the launch of the Fujian in June last year, experts predicted that the third carrier could make sea trials this year, and the next-generation carrier-based fighter jet will eventually conduct tests with the Fujian's electromagnetic aircraft launch system",

      "Kishida and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday signed the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA)",
      " According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the Japan-UK RAA is an agreement that establishes procedures between the two sides for cooperative activities conducted by the defense force of one country while visiting the other, and defines a status of the visiting force",
      " The UK is the second country after Australia to sign the RAA with Japan",
      "The RAA will simplify procedures when implementing cooperative activities, such as port calls of vessels and joint exercises between the two countries and further promoting bilateral security and defense cooperation, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry",
      "The Japanese Foreign Ministry cited the \"more severe\" international security environment in various parts of the world as well as the international order challenged by the Ukraine crisis and so-called \"attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force in the East and South China Seas,\" claiming that the Japan-UK security and defense cooperation will be lifted to new heights and the movement toward the realization of a so-called \"free and open Indo-Pacific\" will be further enhanced",
      "Chinese observers believe that through the pact, the possibility of Japan stationing troops in Britain is almost zero, but the possibility of the UK stationing troops in Japan is quite high",
      "The UK, especially in the last couple of years, has been looking for chances to return to the Asia-Pacific, the Chinese observersnoted",
      "While the UK is adjusting its foreign and security strategy, there is a strong market for a tough stance against China in British politics and it is difficult for Sunak to maintain a balance",
      " Today's Britain no longer believes that it can maintain its interests and status as a great power only by developing trade and economy, and believes instead that it should now turn to military and security aspects to boost its presence, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "The UK has been building security and trade ties in the region",
      " In September 2021, the UK and allies US and Australia announced the establishment of the AUKUS trilateral security pact, and now the UK and Japan have signed the defense pact, both of which have allowed the UK to bring about its Indo-Pacific tilt in military, diplomatic and political strategy",
      " This marked the UK essentially becoming involved in the geopolitical competition in the region, observers warned",
      "However, the UK's move goes against the region's mainstream of peace and development, Cui pointed out",
      " As a country with a colonial history in the region, the UK's military presence goes against the historical trend and will draw disgust from the majority of people in the region, Cui told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "The observer also questioned whether the UK had the ability or finances to support its ambitions",
      " It is also a major test of whether the UK government can afford to play a security role in both Europe and Asia, Cui said, noting that the UK's focus should be in Europe and so-called transatlantic security amid the continuing Ukraine crisis",
      "Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Thursday that the UK and Japan could not have come together to sign this agreement without incitement and pressure from the US",
      " The military expert pointed out that the so-called strategies of Japan and the UK have followed the global strategy of the US, as they both want to boost its influence in the Asia-Pacific to achieve so-called regional hegemony and achieve their own goals",
      "Song said that the possibility of bringing Japan and even Canada into the AUKUS alliance in the near future could not be ruled out, as it could be an important consideration for the US in order to realize its global strategy",
      "The observers warned China to be on the alert to the Japan-UK defense pact and a potential expansion of AUKUS, as closer military cooperation between the allies could be the first dangerous step by the US in reinventing a global military alliance, which will pose a big threat to regional peace and stability",

      " Meanwhile, Ya Ya, a 23-year-old female giant panda that came to the US together with Le Le, has recently suffered from deteriorating health",
      "After an autopsy by a team of Chinese and US panda experts, preliminary results suggest that heart disease was the cause of the death of Le Le",
      " China and the US are now proactively coordinating the return of Ya Ya to China as soon as possible",
      "The two pandas remind people of the 2008 animated blockbusterKung Fu Panda",
      " That was the year pandas became popular worldwide, and eight pandas came from Southwest China's Sichuan Province to Beijing to add cheer to the Summer Olympics",
      "Giant pandas are known as the \"ambassadors\" of China-US friendship and cooperation",
      " In April 1972, only two months after former US president Richard Nixon visited China, two pandas were sent to the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington",
      " For more than 50 years, giant pandas have earned the fondness of Americans, becoming an important link between the peoples of China and the US",
      "Kung Fu Pandarepresents Hollywood's imagination of China",
      " Inthe movie, the clumsy, friendly, and amiable panda is portrayed as an invincible world hero",
      " The image of giant pandas reached its peak in the US when Po, the main character inKung Fu Panda, finally defeated the evil villain Tai Lung, saved the Valley of Peace, and became the true Dragon Warrior",
      " The implication here is certainly more than just an upgrade of the giant panda's image",
      "In reality, this is against the backdrop that China hosted the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008 and became the world's second-largest economy in 2010, and the China-US relationship had maintained steady growth",
      "What viewers see from Kung Fu Panda is the transformation of the giant panda from a cute and friendly rare animal to a powerful hero",
      " When US artists cleverly combine Chinese kung fu with pandas, it may suggest that the image of pandas in the eyes of some US politicians starts to change",
      " In the viewfinder of some US politicians, the giant pandas seem to become increasingly vague, while the \"Red China\" behind them becomes clearer and clearer",
      "In early 2022, there was a political controversy regarding pandas in the US Congress",
      " Some members of Congress positioned pandas as a propaganda \"window dressing\" for China's diplomacy with the US, accusing China of using pandas to \"soften its authoritarian image",
      "\" They even linked pandas with so-called human rights and Xinjiang issues, as well as the Taiwan question, and proposed a bill as posturing",
      "Have pandas really changed? Absolutely not",
      " What has changed, however, is the mentality of the US political elites when observing China",
      " This is one of the reasons why so many Chinese are worried about the status of pandas in the US",
      "An interesting comparison would be that giant panda is still one of the most beloved animals in many countries around the world, including in the US",
      " People won't lose the focus of their cameras just because the panda comes from China, and what they love most about the giant panda is its cute, friendly, and lovable image",
      "For example, the health status of Ya Ya has recently touched the hearts of many panda fans in the US, who have expressed their concerns online",
      " The giant panda is not only China's national treasure, but also a rare world-class animal",
      " It is the responsibility of the Chinese people to protect the giant panda",
      " Over the decades, the Chinese have not changed their intentions",
      "In 2016, the giant panda was downgraded from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\" on the global list of species at risk of extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and China made the same decision in 2021",
      " The current population of giant pandas living in the wild has exceeded 1,800",
      " This is a significant contribution by the world's most populous country to the planet and its ecological environment",
      " It also reflects a major developing country's pursuit of quality development",
      "China has also been able to achieve such great results thanks to its cooperation with other countries, including the one with US experts over giant panda's reproductive techniques",
      " It is believed more people around the world will be able to witness giant pandas in the future, and people will continue to become fans of this animal",
      " With the drumbeat of China's peaceful development, giant pandas will remain active on the global stage as cordial messengers",

      " Some local media reports described the meeting as a \"rare one",
      "\"The Chinese diplomat also urged May to abide by professional ethics as a diplomat and not to walk further down the wrong path",
      " Liu also drew up three redlines for the US official and the US Consulate General in Hong Kong: do not endanger China's national security, do not engage in political infiltration and do not smear and damage the development prospects of the city",
      "The fresh warning was made after China noted some facts about the words and deeds by the US official that were detrimental to national security, to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and to its international reputation, Lau Siu-kai, a consultant from the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies and also a senior policy advisor, told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "\"With the anti-China rioters being held accountable under the National Security Law (NSL) for Hong Kong, the Chinese government won't tolerate the US-led West to replace those rioters to instigate local residents or divide Hong Kong society,\" Lau said",
      "May arrived in the US Consulate General in Hong Kong in September 2022, having previously served as US Consul General in Shenyang, Northeast China's Liaoning Province from 2016 to 2019 and as deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia from 2019, the South China Morning Post said",
      "He criticized the NSL for Hong Kong during an online event in January, saying that many Hong Kong residents do not agree with how the cases of jailed media tycoon Jimmy Lai Chee-ying and other defendants charged under the NSL for Hong Kong were handled",
      " May also commented on the law interpretation by China's top legislature in December, saying that it \"enlarged the power of the administration without being properly monitored by a judicial body,\" according to local media reports",
      "The Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs hit back at those claims, criticizing May for ignoring the promising prospects of Hong Kong society and slandering the city's rule of law and freedom, as well as showing support for anti-China rioters",
      "May's predecessor Hanscom Smith is remembered by many Hong Kong residents as a political figure who tried to interfere in China's internal affairs, sabotage the principle of One country, Two systems and incite subversion after he assumed his post as consul general to Hong Kong and Macao in 2019",
      " Some Hong Kong officials told the Global Times in previous interviews that Smith arrived in the city three years ago with hidden tasks from the US government, with one of them being \"supporting the opposition forces in Hong Kong for illegal assemblies and undermining national security",

      " TikTok Photo: VCGCommenting on the US government's recent ban on a Chinese firm's short video-sharing app TikTok, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Tuesday slammed Washington for its abuse of state power in unreasonably cracking down on businesses from other countries, suggesting the US' lack of confidence against a mobile app",
      "Following a series of moves against TikTok, which is owned by Chinese tech firm ByteDance, the White House on Monday asked US government agencies to get rid of the app from official devices and systems within 30 days, according to Reuters",
      "The move follows a ban ordered by the US Congress, which cited national security concerns, in December 2022",
      " US lawmakers are also set to vote this week on a bill that would give US President Joe Biden the authorities to ban the app from all US devices, Reuters reported",
      "Asked about the US ban on TikTok at a press briefing in Beijing, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said that as the world's No",
      "1 power, the US is actually so afraid of a mobile app that young people like, and that is rather too unconfident",
      "\"We firmly oppose the US' wrong practice of generalizing the concept of national security and abusing state power to unreasonably suppress companies from other countries,\" Mao said, urging the US to respect fair competition principles and stop crackdowns on relevant companies",
      "ByteDance did not comment on the bans as of press time on Tuesday, but its subsidiary, TikTok, said that so-called national security concerns raised by US and other officials are fueled by misinformation",
      " TikTok stressed its efforts to protect user data and privacy",
      "The US move on Monday comes as Canada and the EU imposed similar bans",
      " Canada on Monday issued a ban on TikTop on government-issued devices, with Prime Minister Justine Trudeau suggesting moves could be taken",
      " Last week, the EU's two biggest policymaking bodies also banned the app on staff phones",
      "Notably, despite their repeated citing of security concerns as the reason for the bans, Western officials have not made public any instances of security breaches involving TikTok",
      " The company, which has been trying to convince US and European officials that concerns over its security issues are misplaced, noted that such bans are \"misguided and based on fundamental misconceptions",
      "\"The bans sparked some criticism and opposition within the West",
      " Following the US' move on Monday and ahead of the US House of Representatives' vote on a bill to ban TikTok on all US devices, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), one of the largest public-interest law firms in the US, said it firmly opposes the bill",
      "\"Congress must not censor entire platforms and strip Americans of their constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression",
      " Whether we're discussing the news of the day, livestreaming protests, or even watching cat videos, we have a right to use TikTok and other platforms to exchange our thoughts, ideas, and opinions with people around the country and around the world,\" said Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at ACLU",
      "The ACLU noted, citing a US law, that the US government \"can't ban a social media platform simply because the app is from a Chinese company",
      "\"There are growing concerns among US businesses, especially small businesses, which rely on TikTok to promote their products and services",
      " Despite the politically motivated moves, it might be too difficult to ban the app entirely, analysts noted",
      " The US' increasingly reckless hostility against China has and will continue to hurt its own interests, analysts added",
      "Although the US has been talking up a ban on TikTok and even trying to force the sale of TikTok to a US business, TikTok was the most popular mobile app in the US in 2022, with 99 million downloads, according to Statista",
      " In the EU, 125 million people come to TikTok every month, according to the company",
      "The move against TikTok comes as the US, along with some of its allies, are stepping up the crackdown on Chinese firms, amid their politically motivated containment strategy against China, analysts said",
      "\"Using security as a pretext, the US has cracked down on Chinese companies",
      " And this trend is only going to intensify,\" He Weiwen, a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, told the Global Times on Tuesday",
      "As tension between China and the US continues to deepen, it is necessary to conduct communication \"to manage the differences,\" if not address them, He said",

      " Photo: VCGThe aftermath of an Ohio train derailment accident, which released toxic chemicals into the environment, has been haunting residents in the affected area for more than a week, but the accident had barely caught attention of American mainstream media outlets until very recently",
      " Chinese experts warned that the chemical leak accident, \"underestimated by the US,\" poses a serious safety hazard for Americans living in the affected area, with lingering effects of at least 20 years",
      " They also believe US authorities' \"controlled burn\" of the toxic gas could release more lethal substance into the environment, which they said fully exposed US government's irresponsible attitude toward people's health",
      "The fact that such a catastrophe occurred for more than a week without being extensively reported also reflects toxic trend in US political and media circle, who are too obsessed with creating imaginary enemies, and hyping outside \"threats\", such as the Chinese balloon, that they pay little attention to their own people's calls",
      "On February 3, a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio",
      " About 50 of the train's 150 cars ran off the tracks",
      " Vinyl chloride was slowly released into the air from five of those cars before crews ignited it to get rid of the highly flammable, toxic chemicals in a controlled environment, creating a dark plume of smoke",
      "The next day after the derailment, an official alert warned that local residents needed to move even further away from the disaster zone",
      " The controlled burn reportedly worked and the evacuation order for East Palestine residents was officially lifted on February 8 after authorities claimed real-time air and water monitoring did not find any contaminant levels above screening limits",
      "Yet residents feared for their health as concerns have mounted about the aftermath the chemical leak caused to the environment",
      " Many residents living near the affected area took to social media to report their symptoms after the accident",
      " A Twitter user said on Monday that it \"smelled like a campfire mixed with burning rubber in Pittsburg today",
      " Lots of folks reported headaches",
      "\"A Chinese student who lives about two hours' drive from the affected area told the Global Times that she did not feel discomfort immediately, but she is now suffering from rhinitis and dizziness, which never occurred to her before",
      "Four Chinese students in Pittsburg, which is about one hour away from East Palestine, Ohio, said that the local government has tried to whisk away danger of spillover of the incident, yet the public is suspicious",
      " Many people are now stockpiling mineral water, for fearing the water may be contaminated, some supermarkets are even out of stock of bottled water, said one Chinese student surnamed Xu",
      "On Sunday, the US Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], after monitoring the air, said it had not detected contaminants at \"levels of concern\" in and around East Palestine, although residents may still smell odors",
      " Working with Norfolk Southern and the Columbiana County Emergency Management Agency, the EPA had screened the air inside about 290 homes as of Monday, and said it had not detected vinyl chloride or hydrogen chloride, which can cause life-threatening respiratory issues",
      "The EPA did not respond to the Global Times as of press time",
      "Peng Yingdeng, an expert from China's central government supervision center for environmental protection and emergency management, said that the chemical leak constitutes a serious safety accident, and may impose \"long-term\" health threat to populations nearby",
      " Vinyl chloride is highly inflammable, said Peng, noting that if the vinyl chloride is not burnt completely, it will release more toxic dioxins and phosgene",
      " Dioxins is very difficult to degrade naturally, and once it permeates into soil, may remain there for decades, Peng said",
      " He noted that the grains produced from this soil will cause cancer and mutation inside human bodies",
      "Health experts also called US authorities' handling of the Ohio derailment \"irresponsible and unscientific",
      "\"Ding Xuejia, a professor from Beijing University of Chemical Technology, said that controlled burn is a wrong way to deal with vinyl chloride, noting that after being burnt, the vinyl chloride will release substances that are many times more toxic as the gas itself",
      " Those toxic substances can enter human bodies, go into water body and air, and cause serious damage to people and the environment, said Ding",
      "He predicted without further interference, the aftermath of the incident will linger for at least 20 years or even longer, and probably will lead to surge of number of cancer patients",
      " He urged local residents to take timely health check just in case",
      "The US, as a benchmark that leads global technology, has set up a very bad example in handling such hazard situation, which will cause negative impact on handling risks in chemical industries globally, said Ding",
      "This photo taken on February 9, 2023 with a drone shows the site of a Norfolk Southern freight train carrying toxic chemicals that derailed on February 3, 2023 in East Palestine, Ohio",

      "Stew Peters, a US journalist, posted on Twitter on Monday with shocking video of the explosion saying that \"This is Ohio's Chernobyl",
      " Ohio: Dead fish and cattle being reported as far as 100 miles away from the site",

      " What the HELL is going on?\"US law enforcement officers interrupted NewsNation correspondent Evan Lambert as he broadcast from the disaster zone and arrested the journalist on February 8 under the name of criminal trespassing and resisting arrest",
      " The police insisted that a confrontation occurred between Lambert and a National Guard official after the journalist was told to stop speaking during the Ohio governor's remarks on the train derailment",
      "Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a Tuesday briefing that why some self-labeled free and unbiased media have deliberately ignored the incident such as the Ohio train derailment, which is detrimental to American people's health?The incident, however, has picked up steam on Chinese social media in recent days",
      " As of time of press, three or the 50 most searched topics on China's Sina Weibo were related to the Ohio incident",
      " Hashtag \"release of vinyl chloride in Ohio has caused evacuation of residents\" has been read on Weibo more than 59 million times as of press time",
      " Many netizens even wondered whether the US recent hyping of Chinese balloon, which happened at almost the same time as the train derailment incident, is a move deployed by the US government to divert the public's attention",

      " Compared with such a terrible incident that concerns lives of hundreds of thousands, they believe a balloon story is more eyeball-grabbing,\" said Li, explaining that media's ignorance of the incident is a result of a domestic political atmosphere that has been poisoned for years with the so-called China threat, and Washington has long hyped outside \"threat\" to divert public dissatisfaction on US domestic affairs",
      "The Ohio accident actually exposed the fact that US is suffering from \"political cancer\" as the government now whisked away simmering public concerns over a health catastrophe, but politicians tried a repertoire of tricks to make a fuss about a harmless Chinese balloon, said Li",

      "On Tuesday, the Political Bureau of the 20th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee held a study session on effectively strengthening basic research and consolidating the foundation of self-reliance and self-improvement in science and technology, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Wednesday",
      "While chairing the study session, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, urged the strengthening of basic research so as to consolidate self-reliance and strength in science and technology, according to Xinhua",
      " Xi also noted that strengthening basic research is an urgent requirement to achieve greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology, and it is the only way to build a world leader in science and technology",
      "This comes less than one month after the Political Bureau of the 20th CPC Central Committee held, on January 31, a group study session on accelerating the establishment of a new pattern of development",
      " During the session, Xi also stressed that it is imperative to move faster toward self-reliance in science and technology so as to relieve the stranglehold some countries have tightened on China's development of core technologies",
      "During the study session on Tuesday, Xi also noted the shift of global technological competition toward basic research and called for various efforts to strengthen basic research and solve key technology problems from the source, according to Xinhua",
      " Specifically, Xi called for the strengthening of the forward-looking, strategic and systematic layout of basic research, deepening reform of basic research system and mechanism and building a systemic, high-level platform for talent training",
      "The top leadership's focus on technology self-reliance underscores China's resolve to not only tackle issues in science and technology advancement, including foreign technological blockade, but also become a world leader in science and technology, researchers and analysts said on Wednesday",
      " The focus on basic research is of great significance in terms of tackling bottleneck issues, they noted",
      "\"What this signals is that the nation will improve its science and technology independence from the aspect of basic science and technology,\" Sun Yuzhong, a researcher at the Institute of Computing Technology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday",
      "Sun further noted that the US' technological blockade has become almost \"crazy,\" and external political pressure has brought great challenges to China's basic research",
      " \"So we have to build more completely independent basic scientific research capabilities and facilities,\" Sun said",
      "The US has waged a multifaceted campaign against China's scientific and technology development in recent years with moves such as banning the export of advanced technological components to China",
      " In the latest moves, the US is banning the sale of chip-making equipment to Chinese firms",
      "China has been making great strides in terms of technological application in recent years thanks to its vast market, but, when it comes to basic technological capabilities, more needs to be done, as the US is trying to contain China's technological rise, said Fang Xingdong, founder of Beijing-based technology think tank ChinaLabs",
      "Steady riseWhile China is still falling behind the US in certain areas such as research equipment used in hospitals and research institutions, the country has also seen steady improvement in its basic research capabilities and scale, researchers and analysts noted",

      "09 trillion yuan ($449 billion), exceeding the 3 trillion-yuan mark for the first time ever, according to official data released on Monday",
      " Among them, spending on basic research reached 195",
      "1 billion yuan in 2022, 3",
      "9 times higher than in 2012, accounting for 6",
      "32 percent of the total annual R&D expenditure",
      "While China's spending on basic research is growing steadily, its proportion in total R&D expenditure is lower than that of the US, whose basic research spending makes up about 15 percent of the total R&D expenditure despite a declining trend, according to analysts and official data",
      "\"It takes a long time to build up basic research capabilities, but with greater policy support comes greater efforts and faster speed in strengthening basic research,\" Fang told the Global Times on Wednesday, noting that Chinese firms should also be encouraged to play a bigger role in building up the nation's basic research capabilities",
      "Apart from national laboratories, research institutions and universities, the increasing number of leading technology companies in China are also great assets to the country's effort to bolster basic research, analysts noted",
      " At the end of 2021, there were 330,000 high-tech companies in China, up from 49,000 in 2012, latest official data showed",
      " More than 680 companies listed among the world's top 2,500 R&D spenders in 2021",

      " This is yet another high-level contact between India and Australia after the Quad Foreign Ministers' Meeting in February 2022 and the 13th India-Australia Foreign Ministers' Framework Dialogue in October 2022",
      "In spite of their common historical affiliations, India and Australia have largely kept each other at arm's length",
      " Since the 21st century, bilateral ties have developed, with the establishment of the annual Foreign Ministers' Framework Dialogue, but bumps still exist",
      " It wasn't until 2017 when China-India and China-Australia relations deteriorated that India-Australia relations began to warm up rapidly",
      "Amid the complex strategic considerations behind the intensive engagement between India and Australia, the ultimate purpose is to counterbalance China through expanding cooperation",
      " India and Australia's relationships with China have been at a low ebb",
      " The deepening of China-Australia economic and social ties has intensified Australia's strategic suspicion of China",
      " Meanwhile, although China-India relations thawed in the early days of the Modi administration, anti-China sentiment has been aroused in India in the wake of the border disputes, India's vain attempt to become a member of the UN Security Council, China's veto of India's entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group, as well as the failure of Modi's \"Issue-by-Issue\" diplomacy with China The gap in their national strength and the booming development of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative in South Asia have further ignited India's vigilance toward China",
      " Furthermore, since the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world and strategic competition between China and the US led to the adjustment and reshaping of the global manufacturing industry chain, India has had an ambition to replace China as the \"world factory",
      "\"With the intensified strategic competition between China and the US over the years, Australia and India have reached a consensus on containing China",

      " India, on the other hand, regards the long-term competition between China and the US as a great opportunity for its rise, and has made strategic transformation, shifting from a balanced diplomacy to the path of \"containing China",
      "\"Therefore, both India and Australia seek to consolidate bilateral relations in a bid to reduce their economic dependence on China and strengthen their strategic containment of China",
      " Within the framework of Quad, the US has established military alliances with Japan and Australia, while India has formed an institutionalized military cooperation with Japan and the US respectively, This has left the India-Australia relationship as the weak point in the four countries' security partnerships",
      " Substantial improvement in India-Australia relations will enhance the cooperation of Quad, and will increase their strategic containment of China",
      " But in the meantime, India and Australia obey and serve the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy, which tie themselves more tightly to the US anti-China chariot, risking them to lose diplomatic leeway on the global stage outside the US-led small circle",

      "\" The discussion suggested the strong willingness of the two countries to further strengthen their partnership and clarified the specific fields of future cooperation",

      " It also seeks to provide intellectual support for India-Australia strategic cooperation, propose alternative solutions for specific cooperation as well as forward-looking suggestions for potential problems based on the research results",

      " They make a big deal out of issues related to Xinjiang, Xizang (Tibet), Hong Kong and other affairs, with obvious political motives aimed at intensifying China's ethnic conflicts and dividing the country's territory, despite that many people have acknowledged that China's breakthroughs and contributions in the human rights field have been remarkable, providing an effective reference template for other developing countries",
      " Here, we need to note that the UN Human Rights Council has adopted the resolution on \"The contribution of development to the enjoyment of all human rights\" advocated by China, leaving a significant mark in the history of human rights worldwide",
      "In reality, China has long used truth and facts to repeatedly embarrass these Western anti-China forces",
      " For example, regarding the Xinjiang issue, the State Council Information Office of China released a white paper on Xinjiang's demographic development on September 26, 2021, detailing the demographic development in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region with data and slamming groundless fabrications against Xinjiang such as \"forced labor,\" \"forced sterilization,\" \"parent-child separation,\" \"cultural genocide\" and \"religious persecution",
      "\"As the saying goes, \"seeing is believing",
      "\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying once stated that China welcomes all unbiased people to visit Xinjiang",
      " In 2022, foreign ambassadors and senior diplomats from countries such as Yemen, Iraq, Algeria and Guinea-Bissau visited local mosques, communities and businesses in Xinjiang, gaining a deep understanding of the real situation of the region and enthusiastically shared what they saw and heard in mainstream media",
      "Overseas media and scholars have also spoken out on the Xinjiang issue",
      " For example, US news website \"Grayzone\" exposed a certain anti-China pseudo-scholar's lies about \"ethnic genocide\" in Xinjiang; French writer Maxime Vivas has proved that all rumors related to Xinjiang are false with what he experienced in the region during two trips",
      "Now, let's take a look at Hong Kong",
      " Data shows that in 2020, the amount of funds flowing into Hong Kong reached $50 billion, the city was ranked as the second largest IPO market in the world, and Hong Kong's economy expanded by 7",
      "9 percent in the first three months of 2021",
      " An IMF report published in 2021 affirmed Hong Kong's position as a major international financial center and Moody's Analytics forecast Hong Kong's 2023 gross domestic product growth at 4 percent",
      " All of this is a vote of confidence in the national security law for Hong Kong and the city's development prospects",
      "Non-governmental organizations are inherently political",
      " In fact, take the Amnesty International as an example, its annual report fiercely criticizes China's human rights record every year",
      " However, upon reading Amnesty International's annual human rights reports, it's clear that the objectivity, impartiality and truthfulness of these reports are questionable",
      "Amnesty International has long held political bias against China, and its annual human rights report has always been based on the overall denial of China's human rights work as its main theme",
      " With biased understanding, it tries its best to label China as \"authoritarian\" and \"absent of human rights,\" ignoring China's overall progress in the rule of law and human rights development",
      "On the one hand, these anti-China organizations claim that they \"seek the truth\" and \"maintain objectivity and neutrality,\" but on the other hand, they unconditionally believe the one-sided statements by individuals hiding in the dark, even buying poorly fabricated lies and openly ignoring the Chinese government's upright and positive response",
      " They also ignore the fair voices of objective international organizations, media, and people",
      "For example, in the face of the riots in Hong Kong in 2019, these anti-China organizations ignored the fact that public safety and order in Hong Kong was greatly disrupted, only focusing on the rights of violent criminals and ignoring the rights of most innocent people",
      " Their double standards are disgusting",
      "These anti-China organizations seem to be accustomed to prioritizing their political stance, disregarding facts, and portraying themselves as the only \"saviors",
      "\" This is kind of self-entertainment",
      " They selectively screen information based on their preferences and biases, and select \"human rights defenders\" according to their own standards while downplaying criminal behavior",
      " They make it a habit to denounce and slander, and even resort to hearsay and fabrication of facts",
      " How fair and just can their reports be?These organizations use human rights as a fig leaf to rudely interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign countries, with sinister intentions known to all",
      " They have faced oppositions and resistance from many countries, including China",

      "In the name of \"democracy,\" the US makes a distinction between friends and foes, and engages in a Cold War mentality in the global village",
      " This is US-style democratic hegemony",
      " In terms of international relations, the US actually pays more attention to so-called order and hierarchy",
      " Once such a hierarchical concept is involved, there will be no real democracy",
      " The US regards itself as a leader, and through long-arm jurisdiction, it abuses domestic laws and implements them in the international community, oppresses other countries at will, and seeks only its self-interest",

      " As such, many domestic and foreign institutions are expecting a GDP growth rate of above 5 percent in China this year",
      " The International Monetary Fund, for example, forecast a 5",
      "2 percent-growth compared to a 2",
      "9-percent global growth",
      "\"I think it is more likely that the growth target will be set at above 5 percent this year,\" Xi Junyang, a professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times, noting that while a faster growth rate is expected, there are other policy targets, including sustainable and high-quality growth, instead of pure speed",
      " \"Stability is the key theme, and policy intensity will likely be moderate",
      "\"A series of recent top meetings and official statements also underscored the importance of stability",
      " For example, the tone-setting Central Economic Work Conference in December demanded \"making economic stability a top priority and pursuing steady progress while ensuring economic stability\" for 2023, while eyeing \"an overall recovery and improvement",
      "\" At the conference, top leaders also called for the boosting of domestic demand, enhancing of technological self-reliance and strength and prevention of major risks",
      "Policy priority will be centered around these themes, while specific market sentiment-boosting measures in the financial and real estate sectors can be expected this year, Li Daxiao, chief economist at Shenzhen-based Yingda Securities, told the Global Times",
      " \"At the two sessions each year, there are often major policies for the development of the capital markets, and this year is not likely to be an exception,\" Li said",
      "There are growing expectations for the establishment of a working mechanism to maintain financial stability",
      " A draft law on financial stability submitted to the Standing Committee of the NPC in December stipulates the establishment of a working mechanism to maintain financial stability, the strengthening of the mechanism to prevent and defuse financial risks, the clarification of the division of responsibilities to handle financial risks, and improved response measures to financial risks",
      "While it remains unclear whether the law will be adopted at the upcoming two sessions, the move follows several recent measures to boost the sound development of China's capital market, including the rollout of an across-the-board registration-based initial public offering (IPO) system and revised regulations for Chinese firms' overseas listings, with the latter scheduled to take effect on March 31",
      "Global expectationsMeanwhile, another top priority for China's economic development this year is expanding foreign trade and foreign investment",
      " The Central Economic Work Conference in December also demanded greater efforts to attract and utilize foreign capital",
      " Specifically, the meeting called for wider market access, opening-up of modern services industries and for foreign-funded firms to be granted national treatment",
      "During the two sessions, the Government Work Report will also likely touch on measures to support the export sector amid weakening external demand and further boost foreign investment, helping lift global expectations and inject a sense of stability in a troubled world, analysts noted",
      "Asked by the Global Times about plans to further boost foreign investment on Thursday, Shu Jueting, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), said that the ministry will continue to use a special working mechanism to assist corporate executives to come to China for business talks",
      "The headquarters of dozens of multinationals have already made relevant arrangements with MOFCOM for business inspection trips to China, according to Shu",
      "This also reflects the growing interest among foreign businesses in expanding into the Chinese market",
      " In January, foreign direct investment into the Chinese mainland grew 14",
      "5 percent year-on-year to $127",
      "69 billion, according to MOFCOM",
      "Many foreign businesses, including those from the US, have already announced plans to expand in the Chinese market",
      " For example, US coffee-chain Starbucks said it aims to increase the number of its stores in China to 9,000 and double its net income in China by 2025, the company said in a statement shared with the Global Times",
      "Boosting market expectations is also a top priority for China's economic policymaking this year, according to analysts and recent top meetings",
      " An executive meeting of the State Council on Thursday on handling proposals and suggestions made during the two sessions called for various measures to boost market expectations and consolidate the momentum of economic growth stabilization and recovery",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/Global TimesThe lesson that is clearly demonstrated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict is that the US is prepared to sacrifice a so-called ally in pursuit of its own interests, and its interests in Europe were twofold",
      "One was overtly stated before the Ukraine war started",
      " A White House briefing clearly stated that \"the US in concert with its European allies will weaken Russia to the point where it can have no influence on the international stage",
      "\"That was its first objective in provoking the war",
      " It began that process with the overthrow of the elected government in Ukraine and the establishment of a pro-US government in 2014",
      " From that time, through NATO, the US significantly armed and developed a military capability in Ukraine that would enable it to fight Russia for a considerable length of time, no matter what the huge losses Ukraine would suffer",
      "The prime directive of the US is to maintain its supremacy",
      " It allows no other power to challenge its position as No",
      "1 in the world",
      " Flowing from such a goal, the second aim has been to weaken Europe, to break the connection between the energy and mineral resources from Russia and the industrial powerhouses of Western Europe, which we have seen Washington successfully do",
      " Europe is now virtually completely cut off from any of the resources from Russia and dependent particularly for energy resources on the US - at a vastly increased expense to European budgets and the European people",
      "So Europe is now militarily firmly under US control which has increased its physical military presence in Europe considerably, particularly in Poland, while the continent has been significantly weakened economically and financially",
      " The IMF has released figures very recently showing that Britain's GDP had contracted last year",
      " That is, it slipped backward, whereas Russia's GDP actually grew, because Russia had learned how to live under the sanctions before the war started",
      "Once the Ukraine war started and energy supplies to Europe were cut off - therefore, income from Europe was cut off, Russia turned to the markets in the Global South",
      " So the whole process that the US has used in Ukraine has, in fact, not effectively weakened Russia in the way that the US expected",
      " Instead, it has very effectively weakened Ukraine to the point of driving it into almost nonexistence",
      "But at the same time, it has created enormous opportunities for major US corporations, which Volodymyr Zelensky has said will be engaged in the reconstruction of Ukraine once the war stops, which eventually it will",
      " Ukraine would still exist as a separate entity, and American corporations like BlackRock and so on would come in and privatize Ukraine's industries and rebuild Ukraine's cities",
      " The government in Ukraine would likely curtail the rights of workers and not allow the formation of unions or give workers any capacity to actually negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment in order to enable these American corporations to maximize the profits that they would make",
      "What we can learn from Ukraine is that Australia would gain absolutely nothing from engaging as a proxy for the US in a war against China",
      " China's military capability in comparison to Australia's is overwhelming",
      " The US military capability is still overwhelmingly greater than China's",
      " China has developed a sufficient military capability to defend itself against the US and prevent it from ever succeeding in conquering China",
      " But losses on both sides would be absolutely catastrophic, both for the US and China and indeed for the rest of the world",
      "An article I read recently said that war between the world's two leading economies would completely destroy the global capitalist structure",
      " So if the US aims to maintain its control over the global capitalist structure, it would not, in fact, be in American interests to provoke a war between itself and China",

      " Photo: XinhuaEditor's Note:The two sessions, one of China's most important annual political events, is an important window for the outside world to understand China's development achievements, plans, governance philosophy, diplomatic concepts and global initiatives",
      " Through this window, international observers closely watch China's moves and recognize China's development",
      "Commenting on the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative advocated by China, Nabil Fahmy (Fahmy), former foreign minister of Egypt and visiting senior fellow at the Institute for Global Cooperation and Understanding at Peking University, told Global Times (GT) reporter Liu Zixuan that what's interesting in the Chinese approach, be that in the development or security component, is the focus on shared interests, mutual respect, and the focus on comprehensive, sustained solutions",
      "This is the second interview of the series over the two sessions",
      "GT: According to a government work report submitted Sunday to the national legislature for deliberation,major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics has been conducted on all fronts over the past five years",
      " How do you understand \"major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics?\"Fahmy: It goes without saying that since World War II, the Soviet Union and the US, the two major powers, had competed with each other",
      " Then, China emerged and became a much more prominent global player, first economically and then with more political energy as well, which raised eyebrows and some concerns from the West",
      "There were concerns, particularly in the West, but China will play an increasing role",
      " The first was that it joined the UN Security Council",
      " I think China's interest in playing a role is legitimate",
      " And as long as the major powers all respect international law, there is no legitimate reason for them to be concerned about China",
      "I would also argue that historical precedent has shown us that political interests naturally follow economic interests",
      " That's what happened to the old European countries, as well as exactly what happened to modern Western countries",
      " So it's not surprising that as China develops, it would also want to engage more politically",
      " That's not the issue",
      " The issue is that we must pursue a collective interest and a win-win strategy rather than a zero-sum game",
      "GT: What do the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative advocated by China reflect China's diplomatic philosophy?Fahmy: The more energetic China becomes, the more the existing major powers will be concerned",
      " But that is not a reason for China not to be energetic",
      " I think what's interesting in the Chinese approach, be that in the development or security component, is the focus on shared interests, the focus on mutual respect, and the focus on comprehensive, sustained solutions",
      " These are concepts that are very consistent with and adopted by countries like mine and by the non-aligned and developing world",
      "But it is important for China to talk a little bit more about these initiatives, explain them in more details, and do so in different regional environments that allow for a constructive response to concerns raised by others and allow for a better contextual explanation of how one can better cooperate with China in these areas without being afraid that it is just another major power dealing with different parts of the world",
      "GT: What are your expectations for China's diplomacy after the 20th National Congress of the CPC?Fahmy: It's clear from following China over the last decade or so that China is becoming more vocal, more assertive, and more global in its perspectives",
      " China is becoming more global because it understands that it can only achieve its goals as part of the larger global community",
      " Therefore, it speaks out on these issues",
      " Also, it is becoming more assertive",
      " The Chinese solution is something that has raised eyebrows because it is new",
      "I think the significant contributions made by China in support of particular infrastructure projects, even many projects before the Belt and Road Initiative, are much appreciated in the developing world",
      " These are good starting points, and they are a natural consequence of the development in China",
      " China needs to be very vocal and very engaged in explaining this",
      " You cannot have a passive diplomatic approach",
      " If you have major projects and want to play a global role, you must be more vocal",
      "Nabil Fahmy Photo: interview screenshotGT: In President Xi Jinping's diplomatic philosophy, a human community with a shared future is a very important concept",
      " In your opinion, where does the vitality of this idea come from?Fahmy: Different communities will adopt different approaches",
      " It's important for me because I'm a strong supporter of the UN and the UN Charter that represents the collective nature of our interests",
      " We are all members of one community",
      " Our interests, therefore, should be of a collective nature, be that in development or security",
      " Development needs to be more equitable and more sustainable",
      " And security needs to be more collective as well",
      "Recently, we all suffered from the COVID pandemic",
      " Countries around the world reacted differently",
      " Many of the developed countries were very nationalistic in determining who they supported with the vaccines and who they did not support with the vaccines",
      " It was left with the impression that there were double standards",
      " And the concepts of collectiveness and humanity were not being respected enough",
      "I'm a strong believer in each community choosing its own way of living",
      " Whatever that way is, governments have to be responsive to their communities",
      " That's how these systems work",
      " It is not something that is unresponsive to communities' needs",
      " Different countries need to work together",
      " We need to agree as much as we can on global cooperation standards",
      " That's why we have the UN Charter",
      " That's why we have international agreements",
      "I would argue that democracy is important in international relations, not only within countries but also between countries",
      " When there were 40, 50, or 60 states in the UN, the developed world, both democratic and non-democratic, was quite content with the UN",
      " When the UN included more than 190 states, reflecting an all-in-touch community, they felt it was cumbersome and difficult to respond to, and they preferred to do business outside the UN",
      " That's not a concept that relates to democratic principles",
      " So one cannot have double standards in doing this",
      "GT: In the past few years, China-US relations have experienced a severe deterioration",
      " Under the suppression of the US, China's diplomacy has forged a path of its own",
      " What enlightenment do you think this road has for other countries?Fahmy: Now, China has for generations been pursuing what we call a soft and modest diplomatic path, especially globally, where it has positioned itself as a close friend to the developing world, rather than as a major power with its economic growth",
      " Naturally, it had more needs for markets, and it had more needs for resources",
      " Therefore, frankly, it had more interest in being an engaged partner in the global community",
      " I remember a few years ago when China talked about being ready to embrace a leading role in economic reform at the global level, which was very well received by the economic community",
      " At the same time, it surprised some strategic analysts in the West because they were used to being the ones who defined that alone",
      "So I find the Chinese shift in policy natural",
      " I've been writing for years that not only is China coming, but China has actually arrived in the international community",
      " People started to believe that there would be political as well as economic engagement by China",
      " So I'm quite happy with this",
      " The only point I would emphasize as a developing country is that we want a more equitable world",
      " We want a world based on the rule of law and a world order that is fundamentally multilateral",
      "GT: What are your expectations for the establishment of a China-Arab community with a shared future?Fahmy: First of all, China-Arab engagement has been very impressive, and it's been very open from both sides",
      " At the most recent meeting in Saudi Arabia, where the Chinese president was welcomed in a bilateral visit and also met with Arab leaders, a significant number of Arab leaders committed to projects worth $30 billion over the next few years",
      "But interestingly enough, it wasn't only infrastructure projects",
      " It was a project encompassing digital security, cyber security, the environment, and new clean energy",
      " So it shows you new openness and a new engagement",
      " Much of the Arab world used to be Western-oriented in terms of markets and the economy",
      " Today, China is one of the largest trading partners with a number of Arab countries in the Gulf, as well as in North Africa, where it has made very significant investments",
      " In many countries, including my own country, Egypt, China will continue to be interested in significant energy resources from the Middle East, as well as significant resources in special minerals in Africa",
      " I'm optimistic about the engagement",
      "The only point I keep making to my Egyptian friends, my Arab friends and my Chinese friends is that we have excellent relations at government-to-government level",
      " We need to let more people engage, so that when Chinese industries, markets, and firms come to the Arab markets, they understand how to do business in that market and vice versa",
      " We have Egyptian firms investing in Guangzhou in China",
      " They only learned to do business when they actually established themselves in China and dealt with their Chinese counterparts directly",
      " So more people-to-people engagements are important between the Arab world and China",
      " And I look toward to the relationship with optimism",

      " Medical staff stick to their posts during the Spring Festival holiday",
      " (Xinhua/Zhou Mu)More provinces and cities across China, including Southwest China's Sichuan and Northeast China's Heilongjiang provinces as well as Wuhan in Central China's Hubei Province, Xi'an in Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, have published their detailed interpretation of the health insurance reform in a bid to dispel public misgivings as the reform has sparked heated discussion since details of implementation were published recently",
      "Insiders said the reform of the medical insurance system is to make full use of relevant funds and improve the overall operation efficiency, so that those people in need, especially the elderly, can get more reimbursement, and reduce the economic burden of outpatient services and medicine purchases",
      "This reform is intended to adapt to the development stage of China's medical insurance and to improve the objective needs of the public's medical insurance benefits, experts said, refuting some Western media outlets' claims such as that the healthcare system has been strained by three years of COVID-related expenses",
      "The outpatient mutual aid security mechanism fully embodies the participation and benefit of social insurance for all, they noted",
      "China's health insurance system for urban employees and retirees consists of two parts: mandatory personal accounts with contributions from both employees and employers that mainly pay for ordinary outpatient services; and a pooled fund contributed by employers that is used to reimburse hospitalization bills, outpatient bills for serious diseases, and expenses for some chronic diseases, according to the Xinhua News Agency",
      "After the reform, money that employers deposit into employees' personal accounts will be directly paid to the pooled fund in order to support the reimbursement of ordinary outpatient medical bills",
      "The State Council, China's cabinet, rolled out the guiding instruction for the reform in April 2021",
      "In response to the issues of public concern in promoting the reform, the Wuhan Municipal Healthcare Security Administration issued a detailed interpretation on Tuesday",
      "This reform has increased preferential assistance to special groups",
      " No minimum payment standard has been set for inpatient medical expenses of disabled people who are given minimum living allowances, and the proportion of payments from the pooled fund for employees' medical insurance has been raised by 2 percent",
      "For eligible medical assistance recipients whose out-of-pocket medical expenses exceed 7,000 yuan ($1,015) and who are at risk of returning to poverty after comprehensive coverage by the three systems of basic medical insurance, supplementary medical insurance and medical assistance, preferential assistance will be granted at a rate of 50 percent, with an annual limit of 30,000 yuan, according to the administration",
      "Under the new policy, the number of chronic diseases eligible for outpatient reimbursement in Wuhan will be expanded from 32 in 28 categories to 70 in 37 categories",
      "Separately, the Sichuan Provincial Healthcare Security Administration recently issued an interpretation",
      "Since the reform, the amount deposited each month into personal accounts of the insured people will be reduced in the current period, but the outpatient treatment services will improve, and the people in need will benefit more, the Sichuan authority said",
      "After the reform, the scope of use is also extended to family members",
      " In addition to being used by the insured personnel themselves according to regulations, the personal medical accounts can also be used to pay the medical expenses of their family members",
      "Also, the personal account accounting method is more equitable, the Sichuan authority noted",
      "Both the Sichuan and Wuhan healthcare authorities pointed out that the reform is not being taken because healthcare funds are running out, saying there is no need for insured people to worry about this",
      "In recent years, Sichuan's medical insurance fund has been in balance and operating steadily",
      " By the end of 2022, the province's employee basic medical insurance pooling fund had accumulated a balance of 146",
      "2 billion yuan",
      "A woman who works in a Beijing hospital surnamed Wang told the Global Times that elderly people indeed benefit the most from the reform",
      " Wang's father, who always purchases medicine at hospitals and pharmacies, can get more reimbursement after the reform",
      "\"Previously, my father had to pay by himself his medical expenses surpassing the limit of 20,000 yuan, but this year, he can get part of the expense surpassing 20,000 yuan reimbursed,\" Wang said",
      "Liao Zangyi, associate professor at the School of Politics Science and Public Administration at the University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times on Wednesday that \"it is essentially a game between immediate short-term losses and future long-term gains",
      "\" Liao noted that for individuals, their medical costs will not be raised due to the reform",
      "Liao also pointed out the necessity of reforming China's health insurance system, citing its unreasonable structure",
      "The balance of the medical insurance fund in 2021 was 3",
      "6 trillion yuan, official data showed, of which one-third belonged to individual accounts, meaning that portion of money could not be used by others",
      "\"Money in individual accounts could not play the role of mutual aid in social insurance, and it is difficult to deal with the economic risks brought about by disease only with individual ability,\" said Liao, noting that only by jointly bearing and resolving the risk of disease on the whole-of-society level, the redistribution function of social security could be better reflected",

      "There is a Chinese adage \"same bed, different dreams,\" which describes a relationship of a couple whose lives are intimately intertwined, but have different intents",
      " This seems to be the perfect description of the ties between Washington and New Delhi",
      " The official announcement of the iCET follows an agreement between US President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to create the initiative when they met in Tokyo in May 2022, demonstrating it is needed by both sides",
      "For one, India is willing to ramp up its cooperation with the US in technology, hoping to introduce the advanced technology and attract funding from the US, in a bid to achieve its own accelerated development, thereby replacing China's position in the global industrial and supply chains",
      "As for Washington, to rope in India, on the one hand it has to cater to what the country wants, on the other hand it can promote an agenda that puts India as part of \"friend-shoring,\" and then India can become a supply-chain alternative to China, Liu Zongyi, secretary-general of the Research Center for China-South Asia Cooperation at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times",

      " It is an illusion that India can completely follow the geostrategic path of the US toward China and Russia",

      "A Financial Times article said, citing one US official, that the technology initiative, coupled with other actions, meant that 2023 would \"probably be the most consequential year in US-India diplomacy,\" adding that India was \"the key\" to US ambitions in the region",
      "This expresses the US' urgent desire to improve its relations with India",
      " Some observers say that the US' current intensified actions to woo India indicate the country is stepping up its geopolitical competition with China and Russia but still lacks an efficient approach",

      "\" A few weeks earlier, the former German chancellor Angela Merkel said the same thing",
      " In November, the head of the Canadian government disclosed to the media the contents of his personal consultations with Chinese leader right after the negotiations",
      "This shows us the new quality of communication that Western countries have with other states",
      " There is no place for trust, and therefore no place for normal practice of diplomatic relationships",
      " We all have yet to figure out how to communicate with the US and the West under these conditions, and whether politicians in the US and Europe can return to normal diplomatic practice",
      "The main obstacle to the emergence of just international order is the hegemonic mentality of the West",
      " It is now supported by enormous military capabilities, influence over the world economy and the international media",
      " Therefore, for Western politicians, the words they say in meetings with their counterparts from other states are valueless",

      " At the same time, everyone else has to be tactful, exercise the art of diplomacy, and think beyond their own egotistic interests",
      " Even if Russia did not have reasons to believe Western countries about their willingness to demand from the government of Ukraine the implementation of the Minsk agreements, Moscow continued these negotiations because it was important for the security of all Europe",
      " When US leaders said 30 years ago that NATO would not expand eastward, Russia had to accept their statements because the alternative was to create a risky situation for the entire world",
      " Russia has not been na\u00efve",

      "Currently, the US says it wants to continue a respectful conversation with China",
      " But at the same time, they continue to try and place pressure on China over issues related to its territorial integrity and vital foreign policy interests",
      " The West believes that China, like Russia, values peace for the whole world too much to refuse dialogue with those who constantly seek to undermine it",
      " Late last summer, we all witnessed the highly provocative trip of the speaker of the US House of Representatives to the island of Taiwan",
      " After that, the US expressed to China its desire to strengthen diplomatic dialogue",
      "Then more provocations followed",
      " And there is not much hope that new ones will not come after the visit of the Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Beijing",
      " The US plans to militarize Japan are undermining the foundations of Asian regional security, and Washington will not reconsider them, at the same time assuring China of its willingness to engage in diplomatic dialogue",

      "Secretary of State Blinken, or European ministers believe that the power of the West will always ultimately force the Rest to do business with them",
      " They have a deep disdain for the rest of the international community and believe that any of their cynicism and insults will be forgotten for the sake of resolving the most important issues for other countries and the whole world",

      " As a matter of fact, the US deceives even its close allies",

      " After Berlin agreed to deliver some tanks to Kiev, the US said it would only be able to do the same in a few months",
      " Thus, deception is the basis of relations among Western countries themselves",
      "The hegemonic mentality of the West has a serious material and cultural basis - it is an important obstacle to achieving international stability",

      " Photo:XinhuaThe ongoing health insurance reform will not change the attribution of personal accounts, while offering more benefits to insured people such as supporting the reimbursement of general outpatient bills, an official of China's National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) said on Saturday",
      "Analysts noted that the reform doesn't mean any curtailment of benefits for insured people, which will utilize the funds from personal accounts more efficiently, especially for elderly who normally incur higher medical expenses",
      "Responding to some public concerns regarding the reduced amount deposited each month into personal accounts, the official said that the reform is intended to adjust the contribution from employers to personal accounts as a \"replacement\" to support reimbursement of general outpatient bills",
      "The reform will provide outpatient reimbursement for more areas, while increasing the reimbursement levels for areas already covered",
      "The attribution of the personal accounts will remain unchanged and payments made by employees will still flow into each holder's personal accounts, while retirees do not need to pay for personal accounts",
      "In terms of changes for employees, funds deposited by employers into personal accounts will be directly paid to the pooled fund for outpatient reimbursement instead of placed in personal accounts",
      " The amount of deposits into retirees' accounts will be adjusted based on the changes of standards",
      "The nation's health insurance system includes mandatory personal accounts with contributions from both employees and employers that mainly pay for ordinary outpatient services",
      " It also consists of a pooled fund contributed by employers which is used to reimburse hospitalization bills, outpatient bills for serious illnesses, and expenses for some chronic diseases",
      " The official said the reform involves the adjustment of benefits, and many participants will have different degrees of reduction in the funds allocated to their personal accounts, adding that responsible authorities are stepping up efforts to promote policy convergence before and after the reform",
      "The new outpatient reimbursement arrangement will enhance the benefits for insured people by better utilizing the fund rather than cutting benefits, Wang Chaoqun, associate professor in the Department of Labor and Social Security at Central China Normal University, told the Global Times on Saturday",
      "Wang noted that many elderly people have a higher demand for outpatient services, but the expenses can't be covered by the fund from personal accounts",
      " Meanwhile, funds may remain idle in the accounts of people who have less of a need for immediate medical treatment",
      "The reform will elevate the entire operational efficiency of the health insurance system, Wang said",
      "The reform raises the minimum reimbursement percentage for outpatient medical bills to 50 percent, while mandating efforts to further tip the scales of policy in favor of retired people, according to the Xinhua News Agency",
      "The report noted that retired people in Hohhot, North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, can have up to 6,000 yuan ($870) of their outpatient bills reimbursed, which is 2,000 yuan more than the limit they used to enjoy",
      " The city added 5 percent to the standard reimbursement ratio of outpatient bills for retired people while raising the upper limit for the collective fund to cover their outpatient bills",
      "In addition to supporting the reimbursement of general outpatient bills, the reform will further utilize medical resources, targeting difficulties in getting hospital treatment and expanding the usage of personal accounts to family members",
      "In 2022, the outpatient reimbursement system covered 108",
      "6 billion yuan for insured people, according to NHSA",

      "The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) has given overriding status to the NSL for Hong Kong, and its application should take priority, Xia said at a seminar organized by the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies on ensuring the accurate implementation of the Hong Kong national security law held in Beijing on Friday",
      "The HKSAR should take the initiative to revise and improve its local laws so that they are in line with the NSL for Hong Kong, safeguarding national security and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability in accordance with the law, said Xia",
      "The top legislature in December gave an interpretation of the National Security Law for Hong Kong after the case of infamous secessionist media tycoon Jimmy Lai caused widespread concern that the participation of overseas barristers may affect the fairness of national security cases",
      "In an exclusive interview with the Global Times, Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, a Hong Kong Legislative Council member and a solicitor, said that the HKSAR is expected to complete the process of amending its legal practitioner ordinance as soon as June, and to include the spirit of the top legislature's interpretation of provisions in the NSL for Hong Kong into local laws",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Friday strongly opposed the so-called \"six-monthly report on Hong Kong\" released by the British government",
      "The implementation of the NSL for Hong Kong and the improved electoral system effectively safeguard national security and social stability in the region, and international investors widely recognize that HKSAR's business environment is safer, more stable and predictable, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin pointed out",
      "Xia's remarks have special significance, and fully demonstrate the importance of the NSL for Hong Kong to the steady and long-term implementation of One Country, Two Systems in the region, after the NPC Standing Committee in December adopted the interpretation of Article 14 and Article 47 of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR, Louis Chen, a member of the Election Committee and general secretary of the Hong Kong Legal Exchange Foundation, told the Global Times on Friday",
      "\"The NSL has the overriding status over the [local laws in HKSAR]",
      " Safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests is the highest principle of 'one country, two systems' in HKSAR,\" Chen said",
      "The promulgation and enforcement of the NSL for Hong Kong is an important milestone in the development of the practice of \"one country, two systems\" since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, Xia pointed out",
      "Since the implementation of the law, the mechanism for safeguarding the NSL in Hong Kong has been continuously improved, and national security has been effectively safeguarded",
      " Facts have proved that the implementation of the law is entirely in line with the reality of Hong Kong, which has ensured Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, according to Xia",
      "Wu Yingpeng, a lawyer and barrister-at-law in Hong Kong, told the Global Times on Friday that the NSL for Hong Kong is superior in force to any local laws in HKSAR",
      " \"HKSAR's legal system is an important part of China's legal mechanism",

      " Photo:XinhuaThe Liaoning aircraft carrier group of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy was recently spotted for the first time sailing close to Guam, a key US military node in the second island chain, during its ongoing exercises in the West Pacific, a move analysts said on Thursday showed that the Chinese carrier is ready to defend the country against potential US attacks launched from there, including military interference attempts over the Taiwan question",
      "Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff updated the Liaoning aircraft carrier group's movements in a press release on Wednesday, saying that Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force spotted the PLA Navy's aircraft carrier Liaoning, the Type 055 large destroyer Wuxi, the Type 052D destroyer Chengdu, the Type 054A frigate Zaozhuang and the Type 901 comprehensive replenishment ship Hulunhu continuing their voyage in the West Pacific since entering the region on December 16",
      "The Liaoning has hosted about 260 fighter jet and helicopter landing and takeoff operations from December 17 to Tuesday, according to the Japanese press release",
      "Citing a map attached to the release marked with the routes of the Liaoning aircraft carrier group from December 17 to Tuesday, Japan's Kyodo News said on Wednesday that from December 23 to Sunday, the Chinese carrier group sailed south deeper into the West Pacific, arriving in waters west of Guam, before returning to waters east of the island of Taiwan and south of Japan from Monday to Tuesday",
      "This seems to be the first time the Liaoning has approached Guam, observers said",
      "The Chinese activity is likely a large-scale movement with an eye on the US military, Kyodo News quoted the Japanese Defense Ministry as saying",
      "Guam is home to US air force and bases that host strategic bombers and nuclear-powered submarines, and is considered an important node in the second island chain that is designed to contain China, observers said",
      "The US is building a group of military bases in Guam, Japan and Australia targeting China, with Guam being a core forward operating base featuring all types of military services, Chinese military expert Song Zhongping told the Global Times",
      "The Liaoning's drills in the West Pacific clearly have a tactical background, as it displayed its enhanced capabilities in seizing air superiority and control of sea far away from homeland, Song said",
      "China will never attack US military bases in Guam as long as the US military does not attack China or interfere in the Taiwan question, but having such capabilities is a deterrent against potential US provocations, analysts said",
      "In addition to the Liaoning, which demonstrated its capability in reaching Guam with its latest voyage, the PLA's DF-26 intermediate range ballistic missile and H-6K bomber with air-launched standoff missiles can also reach the island, according to media reports",
      "On Sunday, when the Liaoning aircraft carrier group was near Guam, the PLA Eastern Theater Command organized \"record-breaking\" cross-service joint combat alert patrols and joint fire strike exercises in maritime and aerial areas around the island of Taiwan in a resolute response to the recent escalation in the US-Taiwan collusion, after US President Joe Biden signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 on December 23, marking the first time the US government will finance weapons for the island of Taiwan",
      "Since the PLA has been focusing on training as a system, it cannot be ruled out that the Liaoning aircraft carrier group's far sea exercise was interrelated with the drills around the island of Taiwan, another Chinese military expert told the Global Times on Thursday, requesting anonymity",
      "The waters south of Japan and west of Guam, both areas in which the Liaoning has held exercises, are important in cutting off military interference forces from the US and Japan, the expert said",
      "The Japanese Defense Ministry previously also reported the PLA Navy's Type 055 large destroyer Lhasa, the Type 052D destroyer Kaifeng and the Type 903A replenishment ship Taihu sailed through the Osumi Strait into the West Pacific in mid-December, and has not updated their whereabouts as of press time",
      " The Type 055 large destroyer Anshan, which was previously spotted in the Liaoning aircraft carrier group, is also missing in the latest Japanese report",
      "It is not known if these activities were also interrelated, observers said",

      " The giant panda Meng Meng, who was sent to Germany from China on a long-term loan, is seen playing on wood piles at Berlin Zoo on August 21, 2017",
      "Photo: ICThe controversy over the death and the bad health of a couple of giant pandas named Le Le, 25, and Ya Ya, 23, female, living at the Memphis Zoo in the US has saddened global panda lovers and some Chinese people question whether it is time to end \"panda diplomacy",
      "\" But it is always more than diplomacy or using the cute animal to drive visitor numbers, experts said, noting that the giant panda on-loan practice has already been a huge impetus for global scientific cooperation to protect this precious species shared by humanity",
      "Amid public concern, an expert team had been sent from China to the US zoo recently and delved into Le Le's cause of realty and the health condition of Ya Ya",
      " According to the evaluation, Le Le died of heart disease and Ya Ya remains in a stable physical condition except for hair loss caused by skin disease",
      "In fact, China will continue to follow up and maintain contact with overseas zoos over the condition of giant pandas in order to timely support the living of them in overseas or rectify issues identified overseas zoos",
      " In January 2020, for example, China Wildlife Conservation Association sent a formal letter to South Korea's Everland Zoo after finding that the zoo violated the professional requirements for the protection of giant pandas as it organized performance-related personnel to have close contact with giant panda cubs during entertainment programs, requesting the zoo to immediately stop such activities, stop broadcasting or distributing the videos, and further strengthen scientific rigor",
      "Be-loved treasureSince the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, China has given around 23 giant pandas to nine countries as a token of friendship and goodwill, according to media reports",
      " The Chinese government put an end to the give-away policy in 1982 due to the scarcity of the species and the need for better protection of the animal",
      "The pandas are then offered on loan usually on cooperative research terms from China to some countries and regions, during which any resultant offspring from breeding efforts remains owned by China and sent back to China usually by four years of age for mating",
      "According to media reports, American zoos have to spend up to $1 million a year to rent just one of the animals",
      " Most zoos sign a 10-year contract and would rent a couple at a time out of consideration for reproduction",
      " And if any baby cubs are born, they pay an additional one-time $400,000 to China",
      "That doesn't even include extra costs like the panda's enclosure, medical care, and mountains of bamboo",
      " Before Ya Ya and Le Le arrived in 2003, the Memphis Zoo spent $16 million to build a giant panda facility with traditional Chinese cultural elements, set up a breeding management and veterinary team, and planted about four hectares of bamboo",
      "In the Panda house in Doha that covers about 120,000 square meters, there is a team with some 10 experts to take care of a pair of giant pandas, Jing Jing and Sihai who started to live here in 2022",
      " The team told media that they had learned Sichuan dialect, the language of the natural habitat of giant pandas, in order to cater to Jing Jing and Sihai's habits",
      "Eight hundred kilograms of fresh bamboo will be flown in each week to feed them, according to media reports",
      "The huge popularity of giant pandas is one of the motivations that kept driving many countries and regions to rent pandas from China despite the rocket-high fees",
      "Before Xiang Xiang, born in June 2017 at Ueno Zoo in Japan, returned to China on February 21, floods of panda lovers flocked to the Ueno Zoo to say goodbye to her",
      " Admission to see the giant panda was limited to a preselected lottery of 2,600 entries a day",
      " The final time slot on February 19 was so popular that there were around 70 times as many applicants as there were available entries",
      "Among the 60 on-loan giant pandas in the world, Japan reportedly owns the second largest number with nine, following the US with 11",
      "More than diplomacyBut loaning pandas nowadays is more than \"diplomacy\" or just bringing in more visitors into zoos",
      "The key lies in the friendly and close people-to-people exchanges at civil level between China and overseas countries and regions, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Wednesday",
      "Considered to be a living fossil, the joint research on giant panda conservation has become a symbol of people-to-people exchanges, scientific research, and biodiversity conservation between China and other countries, which has always been valued and taken seriously by all parties, experts noted",
      "The fees paid to China and the incomes of the zoos via giant pandas will be poured back to the reservation of them and the overseas zoos and institutes having giant pandas would communicate and exchange techniques and experience on giant panda raising and reproduction to help make sure the valuable species survive",
      "During the past 10 years, the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda has set up an international and domestic cooperation and exchange platform on giant pandas, attracting 16 countries and regions to join and helping successfully breed 21 giant panda cubs overseas, the center announced in October 2022",
      "The number of captive giant pandas across the world reached 673, nearly double the number from a decade ago",
      " The wild giant panda population in China has risen from 1,114 in the 1980s to 1,864, while the protected habitats for the species have also expanded significantly during the same period, according to the center",
      "In 2013, the Edinburgh zoo's overall income jumped by more than 5 million pounds ($5,991,250) to nearly 15 million and the number of visitors leapt by 51 percent following the arrival of Tian Tian and Yang Guang in late December 2011",
      "The debut of Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing at the National Zoo in Washington DC, the US, in April 1972 attracted more than 20,000 people far and wide and the number of visitors for the first month was as many as 110,000, arousing Panda-mania across the country",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/Global TimesIndonesia plans to push forward talks with China and other Southeast Asian countries to finalize the Code of Conduct (COC) for the South China Sea, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said Saturday at the close of a meeting between ASEAN foreign ministers",
      " Marsudi noted that Indonesia is ready to hold a new round of negotiations on the COC this year, with the first one scheduled for March",
      "Indonesia has always played a very important and constructive role in the peace and stability of the South China Sea (SCS)",
      " Together with Beijing, Jakarta has been actively promoting the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties (DOC) in the South China Sea, which China signed together with ASEAN members in 2002",
      "Today, more than 20 years after the landmark DOC was signed, disputes in the SCS remain a major reason for disagreements and even conflicts among many regional countries",
      " Meanwhile, some non-regional forces, primarily the US, have continued to intervene in regional affairs, from sending warships to flying reconnaissance planes across the waters",
      " This has posed a rather severe challenge to the peace and stability of the SCS",
      " Therefore, reaching the COC as soon as possible is crucial",
      "China welcomes the positive stance from Indonesia - this year's ASEAN chair - over COC negotiations",
      " If Jakarta can seal the deal of the COC talks during its chairmanship, it will undoubtedly create a valuable political asset for the region",
      " But frankly speaking, China will still be glad to see any progress regarding COC, even if an agreement cannot be reached by the end of this year",
      "ASEAN has sent a very clear signal by showing its willingness to step up talks with China: Regional matters should always be decided by regional countries",
      " This, in fact, is the unanimous position of all ASEAN members",
      " The interference from external forces in the SCS disputes will undoubtedly complicate and intensify the issue, which has no good for seeking a resolution",
      "Although Washington has been claiming peace and stability in the SCS are also in its national interests, its actions contradict the reality: Chaos in the region benefits the US more",
      " The country continues to provoke tensions in the area to drive a wedge between China and its neighbors in the SCS, aiming to worsen the strategic environment around Beijing and contain its development",
      " At the same time, the US continues to portray China as a country that \"threatens\" or \"undermines\" SCS order as a \"legitimate\" excuse for the former to expand its military presence in the region",
      "Regional countries need to see clearly Washington's true color in the SCS disputes and the benefits it obtains from stirring up troubles in the region",
      " As long as China and Southeast Asia countries can join hands to reach the COC, this will undoubtedly become a heavy blow to the US' outdated Cold War mentality",
      " On the other hand, we also need to be wary that the US may want to interfere in the talks of the COC, because the country will never accept being treated as an outsider in terms of this",
      "There are concerns that for Beijing and Washington, the situation in SCS is even much more dangerous than that of the Taiwan Straits",
      " If the US wants to provoke a regional conflict with China on a larger scale, cooperation with regional countries will be needed",
      " Yet, it seems that those states are not willing to take sides between China and the US",
      " On the contrary, many of them hold a wary attitude toward Washington",
      " This, to some extent, has hindered US intervention in SCS affairs",
      "ASEAN has been trying hard to maintain a balance between great powers",
      " This is a long-term, fundamental strategy for the organization because it goes in line with ASEAN's development needs",
      " It is impossible for ASEAN members to exclude China or the US completely from these Southeast Asian countries, whether in terms of politics, economy, or security",
      " Therefore, ASEAN does not and will not take sides between China and the US blindly, and this principle is not likely to change at any time",

      "Chinese experts said on Wednesday that the new panel, which is called House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the US and the Communist Party of China, has a strong ideological overtone, and China should be wary of the more aggressive adventurism and destructive behavior of American politicians",
      "For Biden's Democratic administration, managing Republican-created crisis and keeping US external environment stable may be a better way to demonstrate its leadership and deal with the current \"China-centered\" partisan rivalry than to race in the anti-China competition with the extreme Republicans, they said",
      "The House members on Tuesday (ET) voted 365 in favor of establishing the committee, with 65, or about one third of the Democrats, opposing the motion",
      " McCarthy's close ally Mike Gallagher is expected to chair the committee, which will feature 16 members, including 9 Republicans and 7 Democrats",
      "According to CNBC, the committee will be investigative instead of legislative",
      " And it will also be given jurisdiction to call witnesses and hold public hearings",
      " McCarthy said the committee's mission will \"investigate and submit policy recommendations on the status of the Communist Party of China's (CPC) economic, technological, and security progress and its competition with the US, US media reported",
      "Chinese experts said the committee may be endowed with the ability to raise the voice of anti-China public opinion, and may even send its members to visit Taiwan for provocation, and conspire with forces secretly engaged in subverting the Chinese government to undermine the Chinese political system",
      "Wang Wenbin, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said at a routine press conference on Wednesday that China hopes the relevant US politicians will view China and China-US relations in an objective and rational way, and work with China to advance China-US relations featuring development, mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation based on its own interests and the common interests of China and the US",
      "McCarthyism restored by McCarthyThe House's approval of the new select committee also means the fulfillment of Speaker McCarthy's goal of setting a Congress panel targeting China",
      " In May 2020, when McCarthy was the House Minority leader, he announced the formation of the GOP's \"China Task Force,\" a committee of 15 Republican lawmakers to address \"China's challenge",
      "\" Ahead of the midterm election in 2022, he said House Republicans would create a select committee on China",
      "The committee is obviously an updated version of the previous ones McCarthy introduced, said Diao Daming, an expert on US studies and associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing",
      " He told the Global Times that growing pressure from ultra-conservatives in recent years has reinforced McCarthy's tendency to become more aggressive and irrational on China",
      "L\u00fc Xiang, an expert on US studies and a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the CPC's presence on the committee's name illustrates its strong ideological overtones",
      "L\u00fc said, \"Smearing and denigrating the CPC in the ideological field will likely be the focus of the committee",
      "\"\"Some US politicians have interpreted Chinese people's minor grievances in daily life as a sign that China's political system is collapsing",
      " Under this illusion, they are likely to take adventurist actions and cooperate with \"covert subversive forces\" to carry out drastic acts of sabotage against China's political system,\" he said",
      " \"This is not unthinkable, as both McCarthy and Gallagher are utterly reckless politicians",
      "\"Analysts said that the new committee's focus on the CPC as its ideological enemy is reminiscent of Joseph McCarthy, the Republican senator well known for hyping internal \"communist threats",
      "\"\"McCarthy is restoring McCarthyism,\" said L\u00fc",
      " \"We have seen before that in the 1950s, the Chinese Americans and 'communists' in all fields were censored and even convicted in the US",
      " And it may appear again ",
      "",
      "",
      " The new committee may look for people with ties to China and dig up evidence of 'damaging national security",
      "' The US business and academic people who are relatively close to China are likely to be the targets",
      "\"They may also seek out anti-China figures in every corner of society to create a huge anti-China public opinion field similar to the 1950s, said the expert",
      "Judy Chu, a Chinese-American who chairs the Asian Pacific American Caucus in Congress, has expressed opposition to the new committee, citing the known risks of xenophobic rhetoric intensifying anti-Asian hate in the US",
      "\"We cannot forget that rhetoric used around economic competition with Asian countries has resulted in the verbal and physical harassment and even murder of Asian Americans here at home",
      " Since March 2020 and former President Trump's sustained references to the coronavirus as the 'China virus,' over 11,500 hate crimes and incidents against Asian Americans have been reported,\" she said in a statement on Tuesday",
      "Growing risksExperts believe that with the GOP in control of the House, the risk of conflict between the US and China is growing",
      " For the Biden administration, it also means a narrowing policy space",
      "For China in the next two years, it is imperative to be fully vigilant against US' adventurism in all aspects",
      " Our primary task is to prevent and deal with the unexpected, whether it involves China's political security or the \"untimed bombs\" in the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea",
      "In the face of huge political, economic, cultural and social divisions in the US, China is almost the only topic that can unite the US politicians",
      " By setting a new committee, the Republicans have used their House majority to dominate an agenda to show they are ahead of the Democrats, L\u00fc said",
      "The new China select committee will be a \"key gripper\" for McCarthy and the Republicans to \"jostle for the steering wheel\" of US' China policy, and for the GOP-controlled House to compete with the White House over a race of being tougher against China, Diao said",
      "According to Diao, Biden has the potential to compromise and even collude with GOP on some China-related issues with a GOP-led House",
      " But Democrats control the Senate, and if Biden does not want partisanship or the Republicans' hard-line approach to China to seriously disrupt bilateral relations and cooperation, the new committee will be less useful at the legislative process",
      "In that case, the committee is more likely to downgrade its tricks to hearings on China-related issues or dispatching lawmakers to the Taiwan region, he added",
      "The Biden administration needs to be aware that in the face of a more hysterical GOP and House, it can better demonstrate its leadership by choosing to manage the crisis created by the GOP at its own pace, and conducting great power competition on the basis of maintaining a stable external environment for the US, rather than launching a race of being tough against China at the pace of the GOP, Diao said",
      "If the White House acts as a regulator, it will at least mean that there are channels of communication between China and the US that will keep the relationship from getting worse, Diao noted",

      " Illustration: Liu Rui/GTUS President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's pledge to strengthen their countries' ties and bolster alliances in the Indo-Pacific region under the excuse of countering China - their imaginary enemy - represents a ticking bomb for the region's hard-sustained peace, experts said, believing that Japan is also laying ground for hosting the G7 summit this year, to draw in members to concentrate on attacking China",
      "They believe that such \"alliance,\" which endows the country support of military expansion, is a double-edged sword for Tokyo, as it also pushes Japan to the front line of attack and disdain across Indo-Pacific region, as more tensions will be triggered by its ties with US",
      " They warned China to remain on high alert against Japan and the US' next step, especially on the Taiwan question",
      "\"Our security alliance has never been stronger,\" US and Japanese leaders said in a joint statement that included an exhaustive rundown of areas of agreement - from defense and trade to critical technologies and gender equality - but ploughed little new ground",
      "\"At the same time, the Indo-Pacific faces growing challenges, from actions inconsistent with the rules-based international order by China to provocations by North Korea,\" according to the statement",
      "Friday's session at the White House followed results agreed by top military and diplomatic officials from both countries on Wednesday to strengthen Tokyo's air, sea, land, cyber and space defenses and otherwise strengthen integration to counter China",
      "Kishida visits the US on the last leg of his tour of five Group of Seven nations",
      " Japan holds the presidency of the G7 this year and will host the summit in Hiroshima in May, NHK reported",
      " It also said that Kishida planned to brief Biden on a major shift in Japan's security policy announced last month",
      " It includes gaining capabilities to launch counterstrikes and large defense budget increases",
      "Meeting with Biden was the top priority of Kishida's agenda, and its aim is to collude with the US to counter China, L\u00fc Chao, an expert on the Korean Peninsula issue at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, said",
      " At the same time, Japan is laying ground for the G7 summit, which will be held in May this year, to draw members to concentrate on attacking China",
      "The expert also warned China to remain high alert on Japan and the US next steps, especially on the Taiwan question",
      "Japan's move to boost its military ability and strengthen cooperation with the US and other European countries is actually seeing China and other neighboring countries as \"imaginary enemies\"; such moves will certainly bring huge uncertainty to the Indo-Pacific region, Hu Jiping, deputy head of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times",
      "In a bid to project a more positive agenda as space becomes increasingly militarized, the two countries signed a US-Japan Space Cooperation Framework Agreement on Friday to jointly explore \"the moon and other celestial bodies, for peaceful purposes",
      "\"Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing",
      " He told the Global Times on Saturday that not only the move of introducing Western powers into the Indo-Pacific will undermine regional peace and stability, it also sows discord among regional countries, thus making international cooperation more difficult on issues such as economic recovery and climate change",
      "In response to the \"2+2\" security talks between Japanese and US officials, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Friday that \"They claim to uphold the rules-based international order, but what they do is trampling on international law and the basic norms governing international relations and grossly interfering in other countries' internal affairs",
      " What they have done poses a real challenge to regional peace, security and stability",
      "\"The strengthening of ties, seemingly to benefit Kishida's government, is believed by Chinese experts to backfire on Tokyo more than Washington as it has put Japan at the front line of counterattacks and riskier position",
      "Kishida's aggressive military expansion is depriving his country of strategic independence, and making the country closer to becoming the US' vassal and tool for achieving hegemony in the Indo-Pacific, said experts",
      " Such plan may win Kishida political support in the short term, but in the long run, it is made at the cost of Japan's national interest and people's welfare, as more money went to equip the military, so less will be used to solve Japan's pressing social problems, such as its aging population",
      "Several worker and student groups have protested on the streets in Tokyo on Friday, denouncing Japan's military expansion that disrupts people's lives",

Before the \"balloon incident,\" the US had reportedly reached agreements with the Netherlands and Japan to tighten export restrictions against China's chip sector, and stopped providing US companies with licences to export to Huawei",
      " What is the aim of such moves by the US? Is it still possible for the two countries to cooperate? What are the prospects of bilateral ties in 2023? The Global Times reporters Xie Wenting and Bai Yunyi (GT) talked with Charles W",

      "Chas FreemanGT: How do you assess the way the US has dealt with the so-called \"balloon incident\"? What kind of signal does this convey?Freeman: I think the American political elites overreacted to this balloon",
      " Politically, I think Biden was put in a bad position",
      " There is a widespread assumption in the US that this incident was deliberate and the Chinese side wanted to put pressure on the US",
      " I don't believe that, but the fact is that this is the common assumption in the event",
      "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was going to Beijing to do three things: to show that the US and China could talk despite our differences; to show that we could manage the relationship despite our hostility so that we would not have a war; and he wanted to show that the Biden administration was in charge of China policy and could act",
      "The cancellation of the visit had the opposite results",
      " The world is now no longer confident that we can talk",
      " It's not clear that we can manage the relationship",
      " And finally, Biden was put under great domestic political pressure, and he yielded rather than stood his ground",
      " So he looks a bit weak",
      "GT: How do you evaluate the possibility of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China this year? He said he is willing to visit China \"when conditions permit",
      "\" What does he mean by that?Freeman: I really can't say",
      " As I have said, a great deal depends on how we now deal with the balloon issue",
      " This is not a very serious issue, in my view",
      " In fact, I would note that the US military's reaction to the balloon was very sober-minded",
      " They said they didn't regard it as much of an intelligence threat",
      " But it's clear that we do need some kind of meeting between the two sides to try to understand what has happened, why it happened, and see what we can do to prevent it from happening again",
      "GT: How do you view the connection between the \"balloon incident\" and Washington's previous targeted moves toward China, including reportedly reaching agreements with the Netherlands and Japan to tighten export restrictions against China's chip sector, and banning US technology exports to Huawei?Freeman: I don't think they're connected at all, except in terms of the general level of distrust of China that I mentioned",
      " I am not sure what the content of those agreements is",
      " They were obviously reached after pressure on both the Dutch and Japanese governments",
      " They did agree in the end",
      " It's not clear what they agreed to",
      " I argued that these restrictions and other moves by the US are more likely to hurt us than China",
      " They are, in effect, self-harm, not a wise policy",
      " But I have to say that I'm one of the few people arguing that this is a case of self-harm in public",
      " We're in a moment that standing up and arguing against a prevailing public opinion leads people to attack you seriously",
      " So I think this is a bad situation",
      "GT: Have the so-called \"guardrails\" been built between the two countries? What do you think are the difficulties in how the two countries build guardrails at this time?Freeman: In effect, I think the Chinese side has said and I agree that we had guardrails",
      " The guardrails were the understandings that we reached beginning in 1972 with the Shanghai Communique, the China-US Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations [released in 1978] and the August 17 Communique in 1982",
      "We had understandings which enabled us to manage the most difficult issue between us, which is our positions on the Taiwan question",
      " Of course, a lot of things have happened over the past 40 years",
      " There have been changes",
      " This is now a very dangerous situation",
      " So I think I'm not convinced that there is an easy way to prevent this from getting out of hand, because the confrontation seems to me to be getting worse rather than better",
      " But I hope we can avoid a conflict",
      "GT: Do you think the agreement in communiques has been respected by the US on the Taiwan question in recent years?Freeman: I think actually there has been a lot of slippage over the past 40 years",
      " I remember very well what the terms of normalization were",
      " No official relationship, no defense commitment, no troops or facilities on the island",
      " All of these have just been to some extent violated",

      "We are in a situation where American politicians of one sort or another like to go to the island and shake their fist at China",
      " Then China reacts, and then they feel well, we got China's attention, so this is good",
      " Now there are a lot of people in Taiwan who don't like being made into a platform from which American officials or legislators, in this case, can exploit anti-China sentiment in the US",
      " This isn't good for Taiwan",
      " It isn't good for the mainland",

      " I think it's a wise policy",
      " I don't think for a moment that the issue is military; people in the mainland understand that very well, and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) plans on the basis that there would be American intervention in a war over the island of Taiwan",
      "I think maintaining ambiguity is politically very useful and important",
      " I don't think the issue is whether the PLA thinks the US will not intervene or will intervene or whatever",
      " The military always operates on a worst-case basis",
      " The PLA must as a matter of responsibility assume that if there's a war over Taiwan, the US will join the fight",
      " Frankly, I hope we won't, but I can't say we won't",
      "I don't think anybody on either side wants to go to war",
      " The problem is that circumstances could bring us to war",
      " I think the American people, for the most part, are very ignorant on this issue",
      " Chinese know a lot about it because it has to do with your civil war, the fact that it didn't really end and also has to do with your history, with foreign spheres of influence on Chinese territory and so on",
      " Americans don't know anything about this",
      " They don't understand that Taiwan has a history, a very complex history",
      " That history involves not just the Cold War, but things before the Chinese civil war, the Sino-Japanese war, and so on and so forth",
      " So this is not easy to control",
      "GT: Some people said that the balloon incident will draw China and Russia closer",
      " What's your comment on this?Freeman: I think China and Russia have drawn closer because the US is putting pressure on both, not because of the balloon",
      " I don't think the balloon has much to do with it",
      " Now, there are people in the US who mischaracterize China's position on the war in Ukraine and say that China is supporting Russia",

      " China is not taking sides",
      "GT: After the \"balloon incident\" combined with the Ukraine war's impact, what's your perspective for China-US relations in 2023?Freeman: I would like very much to see a basis for progress, but I suspect we are in a holding pattern",
      " I have said elsewhere and I continue to believe that unfortunately, the Sino-American split resembles the Sino-Soviet split in the sense that it was also irrational",
      " It had to do with all kinds of things that happened, including people's temperaments and ideological issues",
      " But it took a quarter of a century for China and Russia, the successor state to the Soviet Union, to find a basis for rapprochement",
      "I think it will be quite a while before the US and China can do the same",
      " I think eventually we will do that because we really need each other",
      " There are too many problems that can't be addressed effectively unless we cooperate",

      " The world depends on Sino-American cooperation",

      " But there are many others",
      " They simply can't be addressed effectively unless the US and China work together",
      " But we can't at the moment",

      "The expert videoconference, scheduled for December 1 to 2 organized by the Academy of Military Sciences amid the intensifying international security situation, will not avoid sensitive issues, but instead focus on discussion of solutions to these issues, Zhao revealed",
      "He also said that depending on the situation of the epidemic, relevant parties all expect the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum to be held in 2023",
      " Initiated in 2006, the Beijing Xiangshan Forum has grown into a vital influential platform for dialogue over defense and security in the Asia-Pacific region",
      " The forum has been postponed since 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic",
      " Instead, yearly expert videoconferences and a series of academic symposiums were held by the Xiangshan Forum Secretariat",
      "So far, 40 experts from 14 countries and one international organization have confirmed they will attend this year's event, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said a press conference on Thursday",
      "The international security situation has been worsening since 2020, of which the Russia-Ukraine conflict is a typical reflection as it broke the peace and stability in Europe that had been sustained for 30 years since the Cold War ended, and it has lasted for a longer period than anyone predicted, Zhao noted",
      "The impact of the conflict on international security is huge, leading to various problems including a refugee crisis, food crisis and energy crisis while exacerbating the economic downturn, Zhao said",
      "At the same time, China-US relations are faced with much uncertainty, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, and climate change deeply affects humans' survival and development",

      "Countries share a mutual understanding of the current international security situation but each has its own solution to it",

      " \"The US divides the countries in the world into different ranks, sets up strategic competitors, exaggerates the competition between major powers, strengthens the alliance system, and engages in 'integrated deterrence",
      "' The key words of their solution are competition, containment and suppression",
      " The US particularly emphasizes military priority as the military is the most useful and most immediately effective tool in its strategic toolbox",
      " Isn't there a saying: no matter where there is a crisis in the world, the US president must first ask where the US aircraft carriers are at that moment,\" Zhao said",
      "China's solution, on the contrary, relies on mutual respect and win-win cooperation and is attentively embodied in the Global Security Initiative (GSI), according to Zhao",
      "The GSI was proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the opening ceremony of the 2022 Boao Forum",
      " Focused on six core areas, the initiative serves as China's solution to the strained international security situation",
      " \"The GSI attaches great importance to the legitimate security concerns of all countries and emphasizes common security and different divisions of security, which clearly surpasses Western national security theories",
      " Which of the proposals of China and the US, or any other solution proposed by a third country, can deal with the complex situation of the current world? We hope that experts and scholars from all over the world will express their opinions at the platform provided by the Beijing Xiangshan Forum,\" Zhao said",
      "Themed on getting together to promote the GSI and safeguard peaceful development, this year's expert videoconference will closely focus on the key word of security and discuss six topics, including the stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region, the impact of regional conflicts on global security, and the changing and unchanging patterns of war",
      "Experts and scholars to attend the conference include those from the US, Russia, India, Japan, South Korea and Singapore",
      " They are expected to engage in heated exchanges over hot issues like the Russia-Ukraine conflict and China-US ties, Zhao predicted",
      "For example, Graham Allison, Douglas Dillon Professor of Government at Harvard University and the author of Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides's Trap? and Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, will express their opinions during a section titled \"Major countries' pursuit of their own interests and share of global security responsibilities",
      "\"According to Allison's theory of Thucydides Trap, when a rising power threatens to displace a ruling one, the most likely outcome is war",
      "\"We decided to invite Allison as we hope he can share his recent observations and thinking on China-US ties and whether he has changed his ideas,\" Zhao said",
      "Kortunov is also a famous and influential scholar and once served in the government",
      " He is also interested in the topic as to whether war is destined to break out between major powers especially between China and the US",
      " But apparently he holds a different idea from Allison based on published material, according Zhao",
      " \"Any country has its own interests that need to be safeguarded, but there are legitimate and illegitimate interests: survival interests and development interests are legitimate and every country needs to safeguard them",
      " But for superpowers, to safeguard the interests of hegemony and group camps, they often have to go beyond their own legitimate interests",
      " Therefore, this section is set to focus on where is the boundary of a country's legitimate security interests, or where is the balance between the pursuit of a major country's own interests and the responsibility for global security,\" Zhao explained",
      "This year's expert videoconference also invited many military attach\u00e9s in China from some foreign countries",
      " This will be conducive to exchanges and interaction between foreign military and Chinese military scholars, and also demonstrate the openness and transparency of the Chinese military",
      " Military attach\u00e9s in China will also have the opportunity to gain an in-depth understanding of Chinese ideas and proposals like the GSI, and the promotion of the establishment of a community with a shared future for mankind, Zhao said",
      "The ninth Beijing Xiangshan Forum held in 2019 witnessed a record number of participants including 23 defense ministers, six chief of the army and another 23 deputy minister-level officials from the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, Africa and Latin America",
      "The forum is a public security product China provided to the world",
      " It has become a vital platform for middle and small countries to express their voices and relevant parties to disputes to exchange ideas, according to Zhao",
      "For example, in 2019, senior officials from North Korea and South Korea attended the forum and interacted; scholars from Israel and Iran also appeared and communicated, according to Zhao",

      " A view of the Taipei city, Taiwan island Photo: UnsplashDuring Spring Festival, the partial restoration of the \"mini three links\" across the Taiwan Straits offered a lot of convenience for Taiwan businessmen and compatriots",
      " With the ending of the Spring Festival holidays, there is debate over whether the \"mini three links\" can remain open",
      " The mainland's aviation authorities recently sent a letter to Taiwan island hoping the two sides can meet each other halfway to promote the normal operation of cross-Straits air routes",
      " It was suggested that priority should be given to the restoration of direct flights to 16 destinations such as Guangzhou, where there is a high concentration of Taiwan compatriots",
      " However, even though polls show that their cross-Straits policy has aroused the dissatisfaction of more than half of the people on the island, the DPP authorities, who suffered a disastrous defeat in the \"nine-in-one\" local elections, have still offered only perfunctory gestures toward cross-Straits issues, ignoring the real expectations and needs of Taiwan businessmen and compatriots",
      "From the recent moves of the DPP authorities on cross-Straits issues, we can get a glimpse of their true attitude toward cross-Straits relations and the characteristics of their future cross-Straits policy",
      " Since the DPP has not given up on the \"Taiwan independence\" line, promoting cross-Straits political, economic, social and cultural decoupling is an inevitable path to implementing \"gradual Taiwan independence",
      "\" The DPP authorities do not want cross-Straits exchanges to fully resume",
      " They are well aware that intensifying cross-Straits economic, trade, social and cultural exchanges will inevitably put more and more pressure on their cross-Straits line, prompting them to make further adjustments in the direction of the \"1992 Consensus",
      "\"On the other hand, the DPP authorities are unwilling to and will never admit that the \"pro-US and anti-mainland\" policy has been a failure",
      " Reviewing the election defeat, they only talked about factors such as the poor economic environment and weak publicity of political achievements",
      " This shows they have no intention of adjusting the cross-Straits line",
      "From this, we can understand the current passive strategy adopted by the DPP authorities on cross-Straits relations",
      " There have been some adjustments in posture and rhetoric, such as the so-called peaceful protection of Taiwan argument advanced by Lai Ching-te, who claims to be a \"pragmatic Taiwan independence worker",
      "\" There was also the Spring Festival reception for Taiwan businessmen from the mainland, which had been suspended for three years",
      " But these actions are just like \"squeezing toothpaste,\" in that they are few and slow",
      " The green camp on the island obviously has expectations and illusions about the interference of external forces, and believes that there is still a chance to play the \"pro-US, anti-China\" card to reap political benefits",
      "However, the current cross-Straits situation is undergoing profound changes",
      " Judging from the changes in public opinion in Taiwan society, there has been an increase in the voices hoping for peaceful exchanges and positive interactions between the two sides, and of concern that Taiwan may fall into the predicament of war",
      " After all, seeing high-ranking officials from the US and the West insisting on visiting Taiwan to make money while leaving behind a mess, and TSMC being forced to invest in the US and transfer high-end chip manufacturing processes, any rational person in the island will know what the right choice is",
      "What is even more noteworthy is that Taiwan's economic growth figures - which the DPP authorities used to boast about - are no longer impressive",
      " The latest Taiwan economic data is chilling",
      " The economic growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2022 was -0",
      "86 percent",
      " The electronics and communications industry, always a pillar for Taiwan's exports, is facing particularly severe challenges",
      " The sharp reduction in overseas orders has directly led to the rare scenario of negative growth in Taiwan's exports",
      "The gradual end of the latest wave of the epidemic and the three-to-five-year life cycle of electronic products have caused a contraction of the global electronic communications industry",
      " From this point of view, Taiwan's economy may not be faced with temporary ups and downs, but a challenge with a longer boom-and-bust cycle",
      " In December 2022, Taiwan's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell by 0",
      "2 percentage points to only 43",
      "7 percent",
      " It has been in a state of contraction for six consecutive months, showing that Taiwan's manufacturing industry is struggling",
      "At the same time, deep-seated contradictions in Taiwan's economy are emerging one after another",
      " The industrial structure tends to become rigid due to long-term and severe unevenness, the high-tech industry has too little coverage in terms of employment, and the traditional manufacturing and service industries have a large number of employees but are continuing to decline",
      " This has caused long-term wage stagnation for ordinary workers on the island",
      "In 2022, due to high imported inflation and the CPI reaching nearly 3 percent, the actual wages of workers in Taiwan experienced negative growth for the second year in a row, and the gap between rich and poor is widening",
      " Dissatisfaction among the middle and lower class and youth groups on the island is gradually rising",
      "In recent years, there has also been a significant increase in violent crime and fraud in Taiwan",
      " The DPP authorities can hardly absolve themselves from blame given their incompetence, but it is also obviously related to the decline in the overall economic and social conditions of the island",
      "In stark contrast, the mainland's economy and society are experiencing rapid recovery and development",
      " All parties, including the IMF and other international organizations, are generally optimistic about this year's economic growth",
      " From this perspective, Taiwan's economy and society cannot get out of the current predicament soon without the mainland",
      " If Taiwan's political ecology improves and mainland tourists can enter the island, its tourism industry and other aspects of the \"common people's economy\" would regain their vitality",
      " If the island's stronger industries could be more deeply integrated with the mainland's booming sectors such as new-energy autos, Taiwan's economy would continue to grow",
      " Both Taiwan and the compatriots on the island cannot wait to see the further resumption of direct flights between the two sides",

      " That is very good",
      " But it will be important to see what measures the Chinese government will take to stimulate growth and to shape development in ways which will also enhance international cooperation with China",
      "The second aspect is more of a long-term nature",
      " Because two sessions this year comes after the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which was held late last year, obviously, there were some important strategic directions defined at the congress",
      " The one I think is particularly interesting is the concept of common prosperity for all",
      "This is particularly important because China has had such an explosive growth in the past 20 or 30 years, which created large differences of wealth and income",
      " Some people did very well and have become very rich, but some people are left behind, and there are many issues of social development that have to be addressed out",
      "It is also necessary to see what kind of strategy will be put in place to deal with intergenerational issues, because the society is aging",
      " In Europe, aging population brings new questions, such as higher costs of healthcare, questions relating to retirement age, and the post-retirement life of people who have completed their most active part of their lives",
      " And there are many other issues, just specific to China, which has had very dynamic urbanization",
      " There are many things which come under the framework of common prosperity for all",
      " And it would be interesting for the world to see how China approaches these issues, as that will have an impact on economy",
      " It will also be important for the world as a whole, which is also dealing with the same kind of issues",
      "All these are the kind of things which will be looking at during the two sessions and the immediate aftermath",
      " And generally, I think one should be hopeful that China's development in the next days will help",
      "GT: At the Boao Forum in April 2022 which you also attended, President Xi Jinping launched his Global Security Initiative",
      " What do you think the China-proposed Global Security Initiative will contribute to the resolution of world security issues?T\u00fcrk: In general, this initiative is very welcome and very timely, and I think that creative and active role of China is highly appreciated",
      " Now the question is how to go further",
      " The new Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang just had an interesting statement over the initiative on February 21",
      " I believe further policy statements will flash out, giving more details to the initiative",
      " This is a very sound conceptual basis for the work",
      " We will see what comes as the follow-up in this conceptual level",
      "Then at the same time, the question of the role of China in addressing the current crisis around the world is going to be important as well",
      " The world has seen that China has taken an active approach in the Middle East",
      " We have seen various communications between China and Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel as well as other actors",
      " We see that China is positioning itself as an important actor in the Middle East",
      "On February 24, China's position paper on political settlement of Ukraine crisis was released, which is a very welcome development",
      " These issues are very serious and very difficult to resolve, but the active role of China is very visible",
      " And obviously, China has been active on that issue from the beginning",
      " For example, in March 2022, China has issued a very interesting statement on Ukraine, in which, among other things, China emphasized the need to rebuild the European security architecture and make it sustainable",
      " Sustainability of security architecture is something that has to be constructed over time",
      " It will be important to watch the further developments",
      "GT: This year marks the 10th anniversary of the BRI",
      " What's your take on the BRI's achievements so far? What is your expectation for the role of the BRI in the post-pandemic era?T\u00fcrk: BRI has already changed the world considerably",
      " In the immediate vicinity of China - that is Southeast Asia, or the Pacific, or Central Asia, where China obviously is historically a major player, China has upgraded its role with the BRI projects",
      "In more distant regions from the perspective of China, such as Latin America, China has become a major, possibly the largest economic partner of many countries in Latin America",
      " And also in Africa, China has concluded BRI agreements with 52 African countries",
      " That means practically all African countries are partners with China",
      "The BRI has already changed much",
      " It is a development initiative, which is characterized by problems of development and cooperation",
      " And China has to take a look at the experience of others",
      " For example, there are some parts of the world where other big players like the European Union or Japan have been active for a long time and has accumulated an important body of experience",
      " In the future, China has to incorporate or absorb the entire development experience and see how best to develop the BRI further",
      " For instance, how to use the digital technologies for the purpose of improving development and taking into account everything that has been happening in the domain of development in the past",
      "I would like to see a model of triangular relationships, although it is not very realistic at this moment",
      " In Africa, for example, it would be interesting to see if African Union could propose to China, European Union, their main partners in development, a kind of more trilateral project",
      "Africa has always cooperated with Europe, and it is now cooperating with China",
      " Each of them brings a different development perspective, it remains to be seen whether the African Union would propose the three sides work together",
      "Conceptually, it is easy to imagine, but it is difficult to do",
      " I would like to see more of that in the future",
      " When talking about the 10th anniversary of the BRI, we have to be encouraged by what has happened so far",
      " But at the same time, we need to explore the whole potential of the BRI",
      " The potential is still very large, much larger than it is exploited at present",
      " I would urge for more ambitious, more imaginative forms of cooperation, which would include other partners as well, not only China, not only the countries concerned, but also other partners",
      "GT: China pursues the diplomatic philosophy of multilateralism and win-win cooperation",
      " In contrast, the US is keen on roping in its allies to create small circles to engage in confrontation",
      " How do you see the comparison between these two countries?T\u00fcrk: Responsibility is the key word in this context",
      " Now we have some global institutions, such as the United Nations (UN), but it cannot do everything, which has been clear from start",
      " There are some regional and trans-regional organizations as well",
      " We have a variety of organizational forms",
      " The question here is, how they could work together, working in a synchronized way",
      "There is nothing wrong if small groups of countries get together to do projects that serve their particular interests",
      " But the Charter of the UN is very clear on the point that enforcement action can be only authorized by the UN Security Council",
      " It cannot be done independently by regional organizations or other small groups of states, except for self-defense",
      "But coming to the general question that you raised, I would say it is important to develop certain principles of cooperation, which will reconcile these two approaches",
      " The key is to follow principles, which I would like to recite very precisely - No state and no group of states should build their security at the expense of other states' security",
      " It's all fine and good if a small group of countries like member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) develop their own security cooperation, in a bid to strengthen their collective security",
      " But it would be wrong if the SCO were to develop a kind of hostile attitude towards countries which are not members of that grouping",
      " It applies to all regional organizations, including the EU, as well as trans-regional organizations such as NATO",
      " I believe that we need to have very serious and responsible political discussion about the principle",
      "GT: In your opinion, will US succeed in its attempt to contain and isolate China? Will China's friend circle get increasingly big? Why?T\u00fcrk: A short answer is no",
      " China cannot be isolated",
      " China is too strongly connected with the whole world to be isolated",
      " That is simply impossible, even if it was attempted",
      " That is also not in the interest of the US to isolate China",
      " That would be unreasonable",
      "I think that one has to understand after the ending of the Cold War, the collapse of Soviet Union and the Soviet system created a vacuum in which the dominant role of the US became inevitable that couldn't happen otherwise",
      " That was 30 years ago",
      " And the subsequent decades have changed, including the rise of China",
      " China today is a much more important international player in every respect and Russia has also been resurgent",
      "In the future, it would be wiser to use some of the wisdom of the era of Richard Nixon, the US president who was probably the most experienced one on foreign policy across US history",
      " He helped developing a kind of a triangular relationship, which included the US, China and the Soviet Union",
      "It is not happening yet, but we could think about a kind of a triangular relations in the future, but perhaps even larger, say a rectangular or quadrangular relationship, which would include the EU in a more creative and independent role in this kind of global management",
      "I think that the future is uncertain, but we have models from the past which are teaching us that stepping out from the unipolar world toward a more multipolar arrangement is possible",
      " And the UN framework is sufficiently comfortable for all that to take place",
      " It's possible and doable",
      " I hope there will be enough wisdom available to make it happen",

      " Illustraion: Xia Qing/GTThe US White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on February 27 asked US federal agencies to remove TikTok from their devices within 30 days",
      "According to OMB, the decision was made to keep US data safe through this program designed by China's ByteDance",
      " The US Congress also banned government employees from using TikTok on their devices for this reason in a bill passed in late December last year",
      "This is just the beginning",
      " A proposal for a broader ban on Tiktok will soon be introduced in Congress",
      " Their reasoning has not been substantiated in any way",
      " All allegations are made using the word \"might,\" ByteDance has also repeatedly stated that the Chinese government has no control over its data, or access to it",
      "The real concern in the United States is the vast internet market that TikTok occupies with its unique technology and the enormous profits it creates",
      "According to eMarketer, 45",
      "3 percent of US social network users use TikTok, compared to 24",
      "2 percent worldwide",
      " We Are Social's latest report released in January said TikTok has over 1 billion active users worldwide and is the sixth most used social platform",
      "TikTok's revenues were $4",
      "697 billion in 2021 and reached $9",
      "4 billion in 2022",
      " Although it still has a gap with Google, Facebook, etc",
      ", its growth momentum is rapid",
      " It directly threatens the advertising revenue of several major social networks in the US",
      "It is foreseeable that if the US does not go after TikTok and curb its growth in the relevant market, several leading US high-tech and networking companies will be affected to varying degrees",
      "This is a so-called competition by The Biden administration",
      " Its National Security Strategy report emphasizes that the next 10 years will be a \"decisive decade\" for the US in its battle with China and that the overall goal of the US strategy toward China is out-compete, of which the most critical is the global market",
      "The internet market will be the fastest-growing market in the future",
      " The prominent feature of the market is internationalization, and any enterprise that wants to be bigger and stronger in this market must focus on the global market sooner or later",
      " Therefore, Chinese and American companies in this field will collide fiercely",
      "This competition initiated by Washington is shown at two levels, one is to curb high-end technology exports to China, to weaken the competitiveness of Chinese manufacturing and technology, to disrupt the supply chain and industrial chain, and at the same time to make every effort to upgrade American high technology so that Chinese technology cannot compete with America in the global market",
      "Another level is to take advantage of human rights and security issues to join hands with allies to squeeze made-in-China and Chinese technology out of the international market",
      "The US crackdown on Huawei, TikTok, etc",
      ", is on two levels simultaneously",
      " We see the decoupling of the industrial and supply chains now",
      " It soon be reflected in the regulation, guidance, and fierce competition for the global market",
      "However, today's globalization has deepened and expanded",
      " The global market cannot be entirely controlled by the US",
      "Although the United States, with its largest consumer market and leading high-tech in the worldwide market has solid competitiveness, over the past two or three decades, America's abilities have declined and are being replaced, meaning that not only China, but many other countries are becoming competitive in the fields of manufacturing and technologyChina, of course, has the most competitive advantages among these countries",
      " In the low and mid-range areas, Chinese manufacturing dominates the global market in many product areas, and is seeking breakthroughs in some high-end areas",
      "Thus, US containment of TikTok is just the beginning, meaning that there will be one nasty battle after another between Chinese manufacturing and technology and American manufacturing and technology in the global marketplace",
      "China's choice can only be to expand and open its consumer market further and support the outward flow of Chinese manufacturing and technology, at the same time, upgrading high-tech and manufacturing industries to create more new products and win a broader global market",

      "This could be seen as a warning to McCarthy that he should not follow his predecessor Nancy Pelosi's suit in provocatively interfering in China's internal affairs, said analysts",
      "Some 34 PLA aircraft and nine PLA vessels had been detected around the island of Taiwan by Wednesday morning in the previous 24 hours, with 20 of the aircraft, including fighter jets, drones and special mission aircraft, crossing the so-called median line and entering the island's self-proclaimed southwest air defense identification zone, the island's defense authority said in a statement on Wednesday",
      "The PLA aircraft crossed the so-called median line from 12 locations, marking the highest number ever, media on the island reported",
      "It is possible that the PLA's activities were related to reports saying that McCarthy would visit the island soon, said media on the island",
      "The PLA has already made patrols and exercises around the island of Taiwan a daily routine, and it is normal that fewer forces are deployed in one day, and more forces are deployed in another day, a Beijing-based military expert told the Global Times on condition of anonymity onWednesday",
      "But McCarthy, together with all external interference and \"Taiwan independence\" forces, should consider the PLA's actions as a warning, because if McCarthy does visit the island in a provocative move, the PLA is bound to response resolutely, the expert said",
      "When then-house speaker Pelosi landed in Taiwan island in August 2022, the PLA held unprecedentedly large-scale exercises, surrounding the island from six directions, and fired conventional ballistic missiles across the island for the first time",
      "If McCarthy, as US house speaker, again visits the island, the PLA could further strengthen its countermeasures, including drills of a larger scale with more training courses, or even setting up exclusion zones that prevent McCarthy from landing, analysts said",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/Global TimesFormer Australia diplomat John Lander said in a recent article, \"The United States is not preparing to go to war against China",
      " The United States is preparing Australia to go to war against China",
      "\" Apparently the US is motivated to push the \"Ukrainization\" of China's surrounding area",
      "The US has recently become aware of the benefits of weakening Russia through proxy wars",
      " By fighting a proxy war on the Ukrainian battlefield, the US has united its Western allies to the greatest extent while avoiding a direct military conflict with Russia, repaired the rift in NATO caused by the Donald Trump administration, and forced Europe to undertake the costs of militarily confronting China",
      " It has tied Europe to the US chariot and made it serve US global hegemony",
      " Moreover, as a global hegemon experiencing relative decline, the US is increasingly incapable of restricting and suppressing emerging countries",
      " Therefore, the US hopes to do the same in the Asia-Pacific region, as it has done in Europe by setting up strategic traps and war quagmire to weaken China",
      "In doing so, the US has continuously lured Australia, Japan and South Korea to the forefront of military confrontation with China",
      " The US has fortified Australia through so-called industrial integration and military deployment, turning Australia into an outpost of confronting China",
      "The US hopes to use Australia to drag China into a costly and protracted strategic trap which is hard to break, consume China's comprehensive strength and economic potential to the greatest extent with the lowest risk, and isolate China in the Asia-Pacific region",
      " By improving the interoperability and integration with Australia's military and political departments, the US has strengthened its penetration and control over the Australian Defence Force, policy making department and domestic intelligence department",
      " Washington is trying to drive Australia to the forefront of war with China while the US can gain without a fight",
      "But the US' conspiracy to \"Ukrainize\" the Asia-Pacific region will not succeed",
      "First of all, China has the ability and confidence to resolve differences through peaceful consultations with neighboring countries, and avoid falling into the so-called \"Ukraine trap\" and defeat the US' plot to block and weaken China through a proxy war",
      " The Ukraine crisis is partly due to the US-led NATO's geopolitical competition strategy of encroaching on Russia's strategic space, and partly due to Russia's failing to properly resolve diplomatic disputes with Ukraine",
      " However, there is no multilateral military organization similar to NATO in the Asia-Pacific region, and China's neighbors are unwilling to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the US under the risk of becoming battlefields",
      " The US thus lacks the opportunity to \"Ukrainize\" them",
      "Second, China's neighboring countries do not want to fall victim to US' \"Ukrainization",
      "\" Instead, they hope to maintain a balance between China and the US and avoid turning to either side",
      "The new Australian government has also reset relations with China and is unwilling to go too far on the road of confronting China",
      " There have been some signs of recovery in China-Australia ties lately",
      "After all, a military conflict with China will be too costly and unbearable",
      " Australia is far away from China, and there is no geopolitical conflict or competition for regional dominance",
      " Australia's allying with the US to confront China is mainly due to its dependence on the US' security protection and its strategic suspicion of China",
      "The US model of proxy war will not work in the Asia-Pacific region",
      " It is the region's popular desire to reject proxy wars and resolve differences through peaceful consultations",
      " Australian people oppose war and yearn for peace, and thus they will not easily become US' mercenaries or strategic pawns",
      " Just as former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser said, the US is \"Australia's dangerous ally",
      "\" Pulling the chestnut out of the fire for the US and engaging in a proxy war with China will only hurt itself, leading to serious inflation, fiscal deficits and damaging Australian people's livelihoods and welfare",
      " Besides, proxy wars can easily escalate into direct military conflicts",
      " Regional wars can spill over to the global politics and economy, causing immeasurably heavy losses and even triggering a nuclear war",

      " Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed his trip to Beijing",
      " On February 4, the US went even further and sent a fighter jet to shoot down the balloon off its East Coast with a missile",
      "\"Hurray! A victory for the US!\" Some declared",
      " To them, the US has successfully defended itself against a deliberate provocation from its most serious competitor",
      "But is this true?China has repeatedly stated that the airship was for civilian use rather than intelligence gathering",
      " And according to the Pentagon's assessment, the balloon didn't \"present a military or physical threat to people on the ground",
      "\"The Convention on International Civil Aviation stipulates that \"every State must refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight",
      "\" As no clear threat was identified and the \"surveillance balloon\" theory unconfirmed, there should have been more appropriate and professional ways to deal with the balloon as it was leaving US airspace",
      "However, this is almost impossible when some American politicians are in a state of paranoia on anything related to China",
      " As The Washington Post observed, those in Congress \"did not stop their hyperventilating,\" some even connected the incident with Gen",
      " Mike Minihan's appalling prediction of a war with China in 2025",
      " Also, all kinds of \"spy balloon\" conspiracies popped out overnight",
      " A US defense official claimed that \"PRC government surveillance balloons transited the continental United States briefly at least three times during the prior administration\" and \"once at the beginning of this administration",
      "\" Well then, why did the US wait until now to respond?More ridiculously, this official concluded that \"these balloons are all part of a PRC fleet of balloons developed to conduct surveillance operations",
      "\" Even the American media have noted that releasing \"spy balloons\" is an outdated surveillance method, providing little value added over what could be collected through satellites",
      " Why should China, \"a pacing challenge\" in the words of US Defense Secretary Lloyd J",
      " Austin, use such a primitive and conspicuous method to glean information?To some extent, the anti-China paranoia speaks more about what the US, not China, has done",
      " After all, the US is the indisputable master of spying",
      "During the Cold War era, the US carried out a series of reconnaissance operations to spy on the Soviet Union with camera-equipped espionage balloons, including Project Moby Dick, Project Skyhook, Project Mogul, Project Grandson and Project Genetrix",
      " In the 1950s, the US regularly flew high-altitude U-2 surveillance planes over the Soviet Union, one of which was shot down by a Soviet missile in 1960",
      "In recent years, the US has been applying the same playbook to China",
      " In 2001, an American EP-3E Aries II reconnaissance plane was caught gathering intelligence over the South China Sea",
      " And in 2016, a Chinese naval ship seized an unmanned US underwater vehicle in the South China Sea",
      " Just as CNN host Fareed Zakaria admitted in his program, \"We spy on them (China) all the time",
      " We have the largest spy apparatus in the world",
      "\"At a time when the world expects China and the US to ease bilateral tensions, the US' reaction to the \"wandering balloon\" is disappointing",
      " Its politicians and media eagerly took the chance to drum up Sinophobia, and the US government has been hijacked by this mood",
      " People cannot help but question the sincerity of the US to properly manage its relations with China, the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world",
      "A line from The Wandering Earth 2 may provide some inspiration: \"Solidarity is the symbol of the birth of human civilization",
      "\" In trying times, it is all the more important for major countries to find a way out together",

      " He called for a renewed effort in strengthening building of the grassroots hospitals so that the country can weather a future public health crisis",
      "Zhang, who is also a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the remarks on Saturday before the first session of the 14th National Committee of the CPPCC",
      "He said that the central government's COVID-19 policies have protected the public from exposure to more lethal variants, which is key for China to achieve victory in its fight against COVID-19",
      "The coordination between grassroots and top hospitals and enhanced building of those grassroots hospitals are also crucial for the victory, said Zhang, who is head of the Center for Infectious Diseases with the Shanghai-based Huashan Hospital of Fudan University",
      "During the interview, he told a story of a visit he made to a hospital located in a rural part of Shanghai one month before Chinese New Year in 2023",
      " COVID-19 cases were surging at that time in China",
      "Zhang said one 70-year-old patient missed the scheduled time to be transferred to a top hospital and had already developed \"white lung",
      "\" In order to save life, Zhang and other doctors arranged an online consultation for the patient",
      " The patient recovered and was released from hospital one month later",
      "Zhang said this has firmed his view of speeding up the construction of grassroots hospitals",
      " \"Now we are at a time when the COVID-19 has ebbed away, so it is a very good time for China to continue to strengthen construction of grassroots hospitals,\" said Zhang",
      "China has achieved a decisive victory in its COVID-19 prevention and control strategy since November 2022, achieving the miracle of a populous country successfully walking out of the pandemic, and the COVID policy adjustment and optimization helped the country achieve a stable transition and keep the overall death rate at the lowest level in the world, Chinese top leadership said last month",

      "In 2011, Chen Dong (pseudonym) and his ex-wife Wang Lei (pseudonym) had a child named Xiao Xuan through in vitro fertilization at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University",
      " However, in 2020, they were shocked to discover that the boy was not biologically related to either of them",
      "This news caused a stir on Chinese social media, particularly after the hospital responded by stating that they could not trace the embryo and urged the couple to be \"open-minded\" about the mix-up",
      "Chen contacted the hospital in an effort to determine the biological parents of his child, as this information would be necessary if a bone marrow transplant was ever required from a blood relative",
      "\"The hospital's mistake totally messed up who is my child,\" Chen, the 50-year-old, said",
      " In the initial trial, the hospital was found fully liable for the incident and was fined 640,000 yuan ($93,055) as compensation for the couple",
      "This case has sparked intense debate about how to address medical negligence in cases involving IVF babies in order to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future",
      "It is not clear how the embryos received by Chen Dong and his wife were transplanted but if the embryos was indeed switched by the hospital without notifying health condition or receiving consent from the parents, the hospital may have violated China's regulations on human assisted reproductive technology and ethical principles, said Wang Yue, a professor of Medical Ethics and Law at Peking University",
      "At the time of the incident in 2011, China was still in the early stages of applying artificial reproductive technology, and there were few standards in place for its management and supervision, noted Wang",
      "There were only a few relevant regulations in place at the time, including the Norms for Human Assisted Reproductive Technology from 2003",
      " In 2013 and 2019, Chinese health authorities issued new regulations aimed at reducing the risks associated with assisted reproductive technology",
      "The National Health Commission (NHC) has now initiated the drafting of the Regulations on the Management of Assisted Reproductive Technology",
      "As the hospital failed to restore the embryos, trace medical records or verify the identity of the embryos, it could face an administrative penalty of up to 30,000 yuan, according to Wang, citing the Norms for Human Assisted Reproductive Technology",
      "Wang called for legislative bodies to impose higher penalties for such cases in order to serve as a deterrent to wrongdoers",
      "The divorced couple said they won't stop loving the boy",
      "\"The child has been raised well, but he is not the child we originally intended to have",
      " It is unacceptable that the hospital made a mistake with the embryos,\" Wang Lei said",
      " However, she stated that they would treat the child as they always have, and that they had even purchased a property for him and had no plans to take it back",
      "Prior to Xiao Xuan, Chen had raised a daughter who was unable to care for herself due to an illness",

      " Wang, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks when delivering a keynote speech to participants of the MSC",
      " Making the world safer is China's abiding commitment, said Wang, adding that at the end of last year, the CPC convened its 20th National Congress",
      " Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, declared at the congress that China's central task in the new era and on the new journey is to advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization",
      " On how to accomplish this modernization of the largest scale in human history, China has given an unequivocal and steadfast answer: to unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, Wang said",
      " Peaceful development is not an expediency nor diplomatic rhetoric, but a strategic choice informed by profound reflections on the past, the present and the future, Wang said",
      " Looking over the past, China suffered deeply from foreign aggression and expansion in modern times, so that China fully appreciates the value of peace and the importance of development, he noted",
      " Shortly after the founding of the People's Republic of China, it put forward the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence",
      " Over the past 70-plus years, China has never initiated a war or occupied an inch of a foreign land, Wang said",
      " It is the only country that has incorporated peaceful development in its Constitution, and the only country among the five Nuclear-Weapon States to pledge no first use of nuclear weapons, according to Wang",
      " China's track record on peace can stand the scrutiny of history and its peaceful rise is an unprecedented miracle in human history, Wang added",
      " At present, the top priority for the CPC and the Chinese government is to pursue high-quality development and deliver a better life for the Chinese people",
      " \"We know fully well that development is only possible in a peaceful and tranquil international environment,\" Wang said",
      " This requires that China lives in peace with other countries and pursues win-win cooperation with the rest of the world",
      " \"We will always be an advocate for peace, development and win-win cooperation, and work to deepen and expand global partnerships based on equality, openness and cooperation,\" Wang said",
      " Looking to the future, peace and development remain the trend of history and the aspiration of the people",
      " Some people assert that a strong country is bound to seek hegemony and assume that China will walk away from peaceful development as it gets stronger, according to Wang",
      " \"However, China's own experience shows that the path of peaceful development has worked and worked well,\" he said",
      " \"There is no reason for us to discontinue but every reason to stay the course and come together with more countries in the pursuit of peaceful development,\" Wang said",
      " \"Any increase in China's strength is an increase in the hope of world peace",

      " Photo: Screenshot from China Central TelevisionThe Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy operates a large fleet of auxiliary ships that provide logistics and combat support in all areas including the frontiers of the South China Sea, as they made a rare, concentrated public appearance in a recent media report",
      "These vessels play vital roles in modern warfare and reflect the PLA Navy's growing capabilities, analysts said on Tuesday",
      "Ported in an undisclosed naval base operated by an auxiliary ship detachment affiliated with the navy of the PLA Southern Theater Command, the auxiliary vessels include comprehensive replenishment ships with displacements of dozens of thousand tons, as well as landing ships, hospital ships, oil tankers and water tankers with displacements of several thousand tons",
      "There are also degaussing ships and remote-controlled target ships with displacements of several hundred tons, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Monday",
      "It means that this auxiliary ship detachment has a large number of vessels of different types that have a variety of missions, as it safeguards the lifeline of support in the frontline of the South China Sea, CCTV said",
      "The mission of the Nanshui 978 water tanker is to replenish fresh water to islands and vessels",
      " A single replenishment can fulfill the fresh water demand of an island with hundreds of people",
      "Designed to transport personnel and goods to islands and reefs rapidly, the Nanyun 831 passenger and cargo transport ship has a large bay under its front deck that enables the vessel to conduct supply missions under complex conditions",
      "The Jinchengshan landing ship has a large deck allowing it to carry tanks in amphibious landing missions",
      " It can also participate in disaster relief and maritime search and rescue missions",
      "Despite being a small vessel, the Nanqin 205 degaussing ship plays a key role in giving stealth to other warships",
      " Magnetic fields are inevitably generated by the Earth's magnetic field around vessels as they sail",
      " These magnetic fields make the vessels vulnerable targets to some weapons, and the degaussing ship's mission is to cleanse other vessels of their magnetic fields",
      "The naval base is also the home port of the comprehensive replenishment ship Weishanhu, which is currently on an escort mission in the far sea",
      " It is the PLA Navy's record holder in terms of escort mission participation, cumulative range sailed and replenishment-at-sea operations conducted",
      "While auxiliary ships are not direct combatants, they are crucial in modern naval warfare, as they provide vital support to combat ships, a Chinese military expert told the Global Times on Tuesday, requesting anonymity",
      "A large navy must have a large fleet of auxiliary ships in addition to combat vessels, the expert said, noting that the PLA Navy is expected to commission more auxiliary ships of different applications as it grows comprehensively",

      " It is time for China to create conditions to improve the quality of the population to make out for the decrease, and to replace factor inputs with productivity",
      "He believed that the declining population, along with COVID-19, exerted a certain impact on the country's consumption",
      " He suggested to fairly and more effectively distribute labor forces, elevate the income of those with low salaries, and expand wide equal access to basic public goods among the public",
      "Cai believed that the remaining 900 million population of labor age can not only supply the labor force, but also act as the basis of China's consumption market",
      "Li Daokui, a prominent Chinese economist, also said at the third China Population and Development Forum in February that there are a series of misunderstandings and misinterpretations in the economic circle and even broader society",

      "4 billion people and the population dividend and vast market advantage still exist",
      " The country still owns huge labor resources, as population within labor ages amounts to 900 million",

      " In 2022, the average education span for people aged between 16-59 reached 10",
      "93 years, an increase of 0",
      "11 compared with that of 2021",
      "Cai suggested that the government should also pay more attention to the support of the aging group, as the population within labor age is shrinking whilst the retired group is expanding",
      "This changed proportion has fundamentally changed the rationale behind our social security system, said Cai, noting that the pay-as-you-go mechanism behind the current social security system may not work with the emergency of the new population trend, thus the pension system needs a new design",

      " Human Rights Council at the United Nations in Geneva Photo: VCGA handful of Western countries have attempted to hijack the 52nd regular session of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) that began in Geneva on Monday as a platform to scorch and further isolate Russia, as well as China, said Chinese experts",
      " They warned that such blatant politicalization of this international mechanism, and the attempt to turn it into an arena for bloc confrontation will dim its sheen as a platform for exploring global human rights development",
      "The experts also said Western countries' exclusive focus on smearing Russia in fact exposes their hypocrisy, as they only use the human rights issue to achieve their own political purposes, while ignoring other human rights crises that need to be addressed, such as the impact of the recent earthquakes in Syria",
      "The UNHRC session will last through April 4, starting with a high-level segment from February 27 to March 2, and dignitaries representing more than 125 member states will address the council",
      "In a speech delivered to the session via video link on Monday, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang proposed the following: committing to a path of human rights development that suits the realities of each country; to the comprehensive promotion and protection of all human rights; to international fairness and justice and to dialogue and cooperation, according to a readout published by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs",
      "No country is qualified to act as the judge on human rights, and human rights should not be used as a pretext for meddling in other countries' internal affairs or holding back other countries' development, said Qin",
      "The purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be observed by all, and human rights exchanges and cooperation be carried out on the basis of equality and mutual respect",
      " The acts by some to politicize, weaponize and instrumentalize human rights issues should be opposed, said the minister",
      "At a news briefing on Tuesday, Mao Ning, spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated Qin's proposals, noting the UNHRC should be a platform for dialogue and cooperation, not a wrestle ring for politicalization and bloc confrontation",
      "Hijacking the platformQin and Mao's remarks were made after Western countries scorched Russia at the UNHRC for its conflict with Ukraine, as the crisis has been dragging on for more than one year",
      "Bonnie Jenkins, the US under secretary of state for arms control and international security, criticized Russia at the UN council for suspending its participation in New START, the last nuclear arms control pact between Moscow and Washington, AFP reported",
      "In her speech to the conference, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock also denounced Russia for \"undermining the arms control architecture we all depend on",
      "\"This is Western countries' common practice to politicalize this platform, turning it into a wrestling ring for bloc confrontation, as well as smearing certain other countries to achieve its own political purposes, Chang Jian, director of the Research Center for Human Rights at the Tianjin-based Nankai University, told the Global Times on Tuesday",
      "Experts said the US and some Western countries' efforts in turning the UNHRC into an arena between \"democratic countries\" and \"authoritarian countries\" will poisoned the atmosphere and sabotaged global human rights causes",
      "The US and the West have highly politicize topics on the Ukraine crisis and plotted to make criticizing Russia as \"politically correct,\" which, however, is not the way to solve related human rights problems, Wang Jiang, an expert with the Institute of China's Borderland Studies at Zhejiang Normal University, told the Global Times on Tuesday",
      "Countries from Europe and others such as the US, Canada and Japan also pushed for a motion to hold a debate over alleged human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region",
      " However, the motion was voted down 19-17 with 11 abstentions as countries from Asia, South America, Africa, and the Middle East have banded together",
      "Chang mentioned that apart from throwing mud at Russia, this small group consisting of Western countries also seeks to make China look bad on this international occasion",
      " \"But those countries forgot the power of the silent majority, as many developing countries are neither willing to publically denounce Russia for the conflict; nor caring to join the club in attacking China,\" said Chang",
      " Western countries are barking louder at the UNHRC, but it is more difficult for them to convince developing countries",
      "Wang said that the UNHRC is facing growing challenges on how to coordinate and perform its duties",
      " The key for its future reforms will also be how to better play its role in promoting global human rights issues",
      "Ignoring the real crisisWang said that as a multilateral platform focusing on human rights issues, wider topics deserve global attention, especially on the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in some countries due to unilateral sanctions",
      "Take Syria",
      " Two devastating earthquakes and numerous aftershocks that hit Turkey and Syria since February 6 have caused more than 50,000 deaths and left millions of children in need of urgent humanitarian support, especially in the war-torn Syria",
      "The unilateral sanctions from the US and European Union had greatly hindered the rescue work after the earthquakes with more countries and the international community calling on the West to lift the sanctions and stop the politicization of aid",
      "The Western countries' selective blindness toward the crisis in Syria and other crises also exposed their hypocrisy on human issues, said Chang, noting that for those countries, human rights issue is just a tool to concoct rumors to sabotage other countries' images, while happily turning a blind eye to the real human rights crisis",

      " NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Photo: AFPIt's almost been a year since the Russia-Ukraine conflict started",
      " The US-led NATO is still mired in the conflict of its own making",
      " Nonetheless, it has already thought of another one",
      "At the Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Saturday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg peddled anxiety, linking the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict to China",
      " \"What is happening in Europe today,\" he warned, \"could happen in Asia tomorrow,\" which many believe was a hint at concerns about a war on the Taiwan island",
      "Stoltenberg said what was on the US' mind",
      " As a political henchman of the US, NATO accomplishes US' will",
      " Also at the conference, US Vice President Kamala Harris claimed that China's support for Russia in the conflict would reward aggression",
      " Obviously, Washington not only tries to drain out the geopolitical value of the Ukraine crisis, but also calls white black to put the blame on China",
      " NATO and the US dance in the same tone to strengthen the so-called threat from Russia and China, in a bid to make NATO member states believe that only the US can provide them security umbrella",
      " Hijacking the security of NATO member states has always been the aim of the US and NATO secretary-general",
      "The only tool a war machine sustains its life is war",
      " Stoltenberg considers the MSC as a platform to fan the flames",
      " Upon the one-year anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, there is no sign of easing on the battlefield",
      " Stoltenberg indicated that the risk of an escalation of the conflict in Ukraine is incomparable with the danger that could arise in the event of a Russian victory",
      "Obviously, NATO finds it needless to hide its essence as the origin of war",
      " As a product of the Cold War, it was supposed to be resting in the ash of history, but now it transfuses blood from the fear it creates on the European soil",
      " At the same time, it is exacerbating anxiety in Asia in preparation for another war",
      " NATO is either in a war or on the path to be in a war",
      "Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times that the US hopes NATO can extend its footprint all over the world, not just remain a transatlantic military organization",
      " Therefore, the US has to keep hyping external threats, unite member states whose interests do not always align and make them spend more on their military budget",
      " Just on Wednesday, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said at NATO headquarters in Brussels that NATO countries will agree to a new pledge this summer to increase defense spending above their previous target",
      "\"US' objective is to control NATO and Europe and turn NATO into a global military alliance",
      " The words of Stoltenberg can be seen as paving the way for NATO involvement into Asia-Pacific affairs,\" Song noted",
      "Sun Xihui, an associate research fellow with the National Institute of International Strategy at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that Stoltenberg attempted to heighten the tense situation in Asia and cause anxiety among Japan and South Korea and even Southeast Asian countries so that they would strengthen military ties with the US and NATO",
      " On the other hand, Stoltenberg hoped to attract international attention on the situation in Taiwan island as a means to pressure China",
      "But a reminder is here: the interests of the US do not equal the interests of NATO member states",
      " Some within NATO consider Russia as a real threat, but they do not view China the same way",
      " Meanwhile, some European countries, especially major powers like Germany and France, do not have iron-clad trust toward the US",
      " Especially after the recent saga over the Nord Stream blast, which has deepened the distrust",
      " Also, judging from how the Russia-Ukraine war has evolved, NATO's ability is falling short of its wish, and it will only find itself at wit's end if it extends to Asia",
      "\"NATO keeps talking about China, which only proves that it is the execution machine of US' will",

      "Chinese military expert Fu Qianshao told the Global Times that China will very likely continue to steadily expand its defense budget in 2023",
      "The modernization of the Chinese People's Liberation Army requires a large funding in order to procure advanced equipment and maintain a high level of training, Fu said",
      "National defense modernization takes decades, requiring China to maintain a certain level of defense spending for many years, Fu said",

      " Around China, then US house speaker Nancy Pelosi provocatively visited China's Taiwanregionin August 2022, the US frequently hyped a potential conflict between China and the US, and Japan has broken away from its defense-only principle and has started procuring offensive missiles that could reach China",
      "Under such an unfavorable situation, China needs to enhance its armed forces' combat readiness, including boosting the procurement of new weapons and equipment, intensifying realistic combat-oriented exercises, and improving troop welfare, which all require extra funding, Song said",
      "Overcoming headwinds including the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, China's GDP expanded by 3 percent year-on-year in 2022, and buoyed by the country's optimized epidemic response and effective pro-growth policies, some economists predicted China's GDP may post a strong 6 percent year-on-year growth at most in 2023",

      " Over the past year, Western countries have been trying to persuade the global public to accept a point of view that it is Russia and the conflict in Ukraine that has caused the global turmoil - therefore, Russia is the initiator of all insecurity, and the West is the one that maintains global security and defeats evil",
      " But is this really the case?The Western concept of security is zero-sum",
      " The Western countries pursue their own absolute security and do not care about sacrificing the security of others",
      " Although Western countries claim that all men are created equal, they actually think that some people are superior to the other, that is, the Anglo-Saxons are superior, and their security should be a priority",
      "Therefore, NATO did not disband after the Cold War, but expanded round after round in the name of maintaining collective security and developed into a behemoth with 30 member states",
      " NATO is now even attempting to extend its footprint to the Asia-Pacific region",
      "It is precisely because the West aggressively pursues its own absolute security, regardless of the security of others, that makes the international security dilemma lasting",
      " The outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in essence is the result of NATO's eastward expansion and squeezing Russia's strategic space",
      " In the end, it is the West itself that has brought about the bitter consequences",
      "Moreover, the West's security behavior is unfettered",
      " It acts recklessly around the world and artificially creates security threats",
      " Since modern times, Western powers have gradually become the dominant force in the world by virtue of their advantages in military and economic fields",
      "From the perspective of security, the history of the world dominated by the West is nothing short of a history of war and conflict",
      " Based on a sense of superiority, the West is used to bossing around non-Western countries",
      " The three post-Cold War conflicts triggered by the US and its allies - the Kosovo war, the Afghanistan war, and the Iraq war - not only failed to solve security problems, but left only messes",
      "Furthermore, the West's security capabilities are limited, and the West alone cannot solve growing security threats",
      " Since the beginning of the new century, the center of gravity of global power has accelerated shifting from West to East, and the collective rise of the East has brought about the relative weakness of the West",
      " Since 2022, the West has been exhausted by high inflation, economic recession, and various social conflicts",
      " In contrast, global security issues continue to increase and intensify, as both traditional and non-traditional security threats grow",
      "The main contradiction of the global security order is the conflict between the reduction of public security caused by the relative weakening of the West and the surging of traditional and non-traditional security threats around the world",
      " This cannot be solved by the West alone, but only through cooperation",
      "Just a few days after the release of the Munich Security Report, Wang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, attended the 59th Munich Security Conference in Germany and delivered a keynote speech, entitled \"Making the World a Safer Place",
      "\" In his address, Wang introduced the world to a different security vision from that of the West",
      "This year's Munich Security Conference can be seen as a clash of two concepts of security",
      " One is the traditional security concept that adheres to the Western concept of a zero-sum game and Cold War mentality",
      " It takes power politics and militarism as the code of conduct, seeks bloc confrontation and sacrifices the security of other countries for the West's so-called absolute security",
      " The other is the new vision of security which advocates a concept of common security, respecting and safeguarding the security of every country",
      "The West draws ideological lines to incite division, engage in fake multilateralism, undermine the international order under the banner of so-called rules, and drag the world into uncertainties",
      " This is obviously undesirable",
      "How to choose the security concept and reconstruct the security order is related to the future of mankind",

      " Representatives from the US and European countries have tried to turn the Foreign Ministers' Meeting into an anti-Russia meeting",
      " To some extent, this is a manifestation of the Western push for pan-securitization in G20 and its attempt to change G20's original intention",
      " Many developing countries including last year's host of G20 presidency Indonesia, this year's host India, and China all have expressed their concerns and opposition to this trend",
      "To prevent the Foreign Ministers' Meeting from going off-topic, the host, New Delhi, made preparations in advance by including topics such as climate change, counter-terrorism, energy and food security, and debt issues of developing countries into the agenda, with the aim to make the participants focus on economic cooperation",
      " Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a video speech even bluntly warned that \"global governance has failed in both its mandates\" - to prevent future wars and to foster international cooperation",
      " This is also the stance of the vast emerging and developing countries that account for more than half of the world's population",
      " These countries generally hope to end conflicts and divisions, and achieve economic recovery in the post-pandemic era as soon as possible",
      "Unfortunately, like the FMCBG held a few days ago, this G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting also failed to produce a joint statement",
      " At the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting, we have not only seen the severity of global differences, but also felt the paranoid attitude of the US and Western countries in intensifying these differences",
      " Although Secretary of State Antony Blinken and some European foreign ministers said they strongly supported India's G20 priorities, they did not take the host's words seriously, but instead continued to instrumentalize and weaponize G20, using geopolitics to hijack the development agenda that G20 is supposed to focus on",
      "There are many prominent challenges facing the international economic and development fields at present, and G20 can play a role in many areas",
      " It should be an important platform for solving problems, resolving differences, and promoting cooperation, rather than a stage for political showmanship or quarreling",
      " Every meaningless political slogan or sarcastic accusation at this platform is a waste of this precious opportunity and time",
      " In other words, the global economic cooperation situation is already very fragile and urgently needs new energy",
      " It cannot withstand new disruptions",
      " At this critical moment, each member of G20 has a responsibility to demonstrate political wisdom and a sense of responsibility to seek common ground while putting aside differences",
      "On March 2, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang delivered a speech at the first session of G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting, titled \"Enhancing Multilateralism and Promoting Global Development,\" emphasizing the principles of dialogue on an equal footing and consensus-building through consultation, and opposing power politics and even bloc confrontation",
      " He also mentioned specific issues that concern the general well-being of the international community, such as the debt treatment of developing countries, the shareholding review of the World Bank, and the prevention of illegal cross-border traffic of waste",
      " Regarding the crisis in Ukraine, Qin stated that China will always stand on the side of peace, actively promote peace talks, and play a constructive role",
      "China's statement hits the difficulties and obstacles facing international cooperation at present and proposes constructive solutions with strong relevance, representation and feasibility, which should trigger corresponding joint actions within the G20",
      "It is worth mentioning that India, G20's rotating chair, has always garnered much attention from Washington",
      " Especially when there is any sign of trouble between India and China, US and Western media is always eager to exaggerate the \"divergences\" between the two countries",
      " However, at this G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting, the foreign ministers of China and India held talks and both expressed their firm attitude to support multilateralism, oppose confrontation, and focus on development cooperation on multiple occasions",
      " This also represents the trend of the world and the aspirations of developing countries",
      " If it weren't for the deliberate disruptions by the US and the West, global cooperation like this might have come faster",
      "We also noticed that at the opening ceremony of the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting, all participants observed a minute of silence for the victims of the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria",
      " This was a rare touch of warmth amid the growing division and intensifying confrontation",
      " It shows that transcending differences and engaging in dialogue and cooperation are not only possible, but also have a deep root in international community",
      " We hope that all parties can shoulder their responsibilities, demonstrate cooperation, and contribute to promoting global development and prosperity",

      "cnChinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang is scheduled to visit Indonesia from Tuesday in anticipation of further facilitating the building of a China-Indonesia community of a shared future and to maintain closer interactions with ASEAN amid growing noises from the US that have posed threats to regional stability and development, analysts said",
      "During the three-day visit, Qin will meet with Indonesian President Joko Widodo",
      " He will also chair the 4th meeting of the Joint Commission on Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC) between China and Indonesia and visit the ASEAN Secretariat, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a press conference on Monday",
      "This is Qin's first outbound visit after the Chinese New Year and his first visit to a neighboring country after he took the post in December 2022, highlighting the great importance China attaches to relations with Indonesia and ASEAN and underscoring regional countries' joint efforts in seeking development and maintaining stability amid the growing risks of great power geopolitics and interference, analysts said",
      "Qin's visit to Indonesia is of strategic significance and will further spur the two countries to implement the consensus reached by the top leaders in building a community of a shared future and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, as well as to deepen practical cooperation in all fields, Xu Liping, director of the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times",
      "Indonesia is the place where Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road for the first time in October 2013",
      " Further facilitating cooperation especially with those under the Belt and Road Initiative would be significant for China and Indonesia, Xu said",
      "Xu noted that more efforts will be made to advance major projects, including the development of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridor and the \"Two Countries, Twin Parks\" and the Jakarta-Bandung High-speed Railway",
      "Qin's visit to Indonesia will beef up coordination and cooperation with ASEAN as Indonesia holds the rotating ASEAN chairmanship this year and Indonesia has long played an important role in promoting regional development, Ge Hongliang, director of the China-ASEAN Maritime Security Research Center at Guangxi University for Nationalities, told the Global Times on Tuesday",
      "Issues on the South China Sea might be discussed as China and ASEAN countries are working on the negotiations for the adoption of a Code of Conduct (COC) for the South China Sea, as the current situation has become more complicated with interference from outside, especially from the US, Ge said",
      "Indonesia plans to intensify talks with China and other ASEAN countries to finalize the COC for the South China Sea, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi told media at the close of a meeting between ASEAN foreign ministers",
      "Since China and ASEAN countries launched the COC consultation, much progress has been achieved",
      "While China and regional countries are working to put differences aside, the US has ramped up meddling with related issues, observers said",
      "For example, in recent weeks, despite China's reiteration on its communication with the Philippines via maritime-related channels, the US kept hyping issues around China's use of a laser against boat of the Philippines and boasting of its support for the Philippines",
      "The increasing disturbance from the US may impede regional countries' efforts in building the South China Sea as a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation",
      " Moreover, the US' inciting confrontation and pulling countries into small cliques in the Indo-Pacific region has increased tension in the regional environment and cast a shadow on regional development, said Ge",
      "Ge said that such a backdrop highlights the necessity for closer exchanges between China and ASEAN members on managing disputes related to the South China Sea",
      "Analysts said that as the international community pays close attention to China-US relations, which have been further strained after the US shot down a Chinese civilian airship, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin will also discuss strategic competition of major countries and other global issues of shared concern with ASEAN countries",
      "As the US is addicted to playing geopolitical games, it has also increased pressure on ASEAN countries in taking sides between China and the US",
      " However, instead of being the US' cannon folder, ASEAN countries are wise enough to know that they should focus on their own development, said analysts",

      " The Knockout Photo: VCGNo matter how some US media outlets use malicious labels to describe Chinese anti-corruption dramas, one thing is indisputable: The US, under the current corrupt political system and toxic political environment, will never be able to produce a similar drama that can resonate strongly with the public",
      "A February 18 article in Foreign Policy, entitled \"China's Newest Action TV Show Is a Propaganda Hit,\" laid its eyes on the recent hit Chinese TV series The Knockout",
      " It argues that \"at base, The Knockout is a tribute to Chinese leader Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign,\" adding that the TV drama is \"part of a broader campaign to popularize propaganda in Chinese film and TV",
      "\"The Knockout is among a number of Chinese dramas under the theme of anti-corruption that have received positive reviews and high ratings in China in recent years",
      " The popularity of these series reflects the Chinese public's particular interest in the country's campaign against corruption",
      "Chinese officials often play a pioneering role in society",
      " As China has a massive officialdom system, how these people behave is closely linked to the ethos of the whole country",
      " It can even be said that, to a large extent, the fight against corruption in China determines the future of the Chinese system",
      "The Chinese anti-corruption hit dramas are a projection of the country's anti-corruption achievements under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in the cultural field",
      " It also demonstrates that China's anti-corruption efforts have been well-acknowledged by the Chinese people",
      "The success of China's anti-corruption campaign has purified the country's political system, making the society healthier and more vibrant",
      " It has earned more prestige among the people for the Chinese government and the CPC, enhancing the cohesion of the society",
      "Yet, based on ideological judgments, some Western media have labeled China's anti-corruption dramas as \"propaganda",
      "\" They obviously view China's political environment through tinted glasses as usual and nitpick China's achievements",
      " This only exposes their extreme strategic selfishness and dark mind",
      "If we take a look at the popular US series that focus on their politics, such as House of Cards, what we will see is the exchange of political interests and the struggle for power in the US",
      " This mirrors the dirty, dark and degenerate side of the US game for power",
      " However, unlike the celebration of anti-corruption achievements in Chinese dramas, these series give viewers only a strong sense of powerlessness",
      "Fan Peng, a research fellow at the Institute of Political Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that the relationship between individual officials and the official system is like the one between trees and forests",
      " The one who fights corruption is exactly the \"owner\" of the forest, the CPC",
      " Aiming at the whole forest, it tries to eliminate all the rotten trees",
      " Such a dynamic force is the core of China's anti-corruption effort",
      "But that's not the case in the US, a country plagued by systemic corruption",
      " Their ideology leaves no space for self-correction or self-revolution, Fan noted",
      " This makes it impossible for Washington and its politicians to handle corruption the way Beijing has been doing",
      "Showing no hope of change or improvement, series like House of Cards can only strengthen the US public's perception that their government and politicians are terrible in nature, continuing to lower their trust in Washington and US politics",
      "Just look at how US politicians reacted in several recent series in the US",
      " In the dispute over a \"wandering balloon\" with China, some of these people displayed extreme hysteria and unreasonableness",
      " In the Ohio train derailment, some were either indifferent to the health and safety of the people, while some started their playacting only after the incident had made headlines, acting as if they valued the public's interest",
      " Which type of these politicians cannot be found in House of Cards? How can Americans believe in the US system in light of this?Fan says that another major premise for China to produce anti-corruption dramas is that the literary and art circles in China create cultural products from a position of righteousness",
      " The US can celebrate individuality and rights, but no one dares to challenge corruption from a social justice perspective",
      "\"The US is so torn up that all of its narratives come from only parts of its society",
      " There is always otherness in such a narrow perspective",
      " Therefore, one should not expect the US to produce a drama like The Knockout,\" Fan noted",

      " National flags of China, Belarus Photo:VCGBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Tuesday kicked off a three-day state visit to China and is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing",
      " His visit comes as China attempts to promote a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis through a position paper issued on the first anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict, and the US smears China of \"supplying weapons\" to Russia",
      "The 10th anniversary of the China-initiated Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is also an important juncture that could easily be obscured by geopolitical conflict, as Belarus was among the first countries to support and participate in the initiative",
      "Chinese experts believe that economic and trade cooperation under the BRI, including boosting bilateral trade volume, will be a focus of the visit",
      " In an interview with Belarusian state media BelTA on Monday, Chinese Ambassador to Belarus Xie Xiaoyong disclosed that there will be an in-depth exchange of views on bilateral cooperation in various fields and on the international and regional agenda",
      "A number of cooperation documents will be signed in areas such as politics, economy, trade, finance, manufacturing, agriculture, science and technology, sports, tourism, healthcare, interregional cooperation and mass media, Xie said",
      "China and Belarus agreed to upgrade bilateral relations to an all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership in September 2022",
      " BelTA said Lukashenko's visit will continue the long-standing policy to build relations of friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation",
      "Zhao Huirong, an Eastern European studies expert from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday that after the upgrading of ties, the two sides are seeking to enrich the meaning of the all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership, which means economic and trade cooperation could be a focus of the visit",
      "Belarus hopes that China will continue to increase investment, ensure the steady development of previous investment projects and production capacity cooperation projects in Belarus, and enhance bilateral trade volume, especially when Belarus is facing Western sanctions and containment, Zhao said",
      "With the growth of biliteral ties, China and Belarus has seen a boom in trade over the past years",
      " Statistics from the General Administration of Customs of China show that two-way trade surpassed $5 billion in 2022, up by 33 percent year-on-year",
      "Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times that Belarus is a country where the BRI has yielded fruitful results, such as the Great Stone China-Belarus Industrial Park and other free economic zones",
      "Belarus is halfway between Russia and Europe and is on the China-Europe freight train route",
      " In addition, Belarus has a strong machine manufacturing sector, which means there is a lot of room for cooperation in the future, Cui said",
      "And it is believed that the two countries will make progress in trade cooperation, production capacity cooperation, logistics, digital economy and other areas under the BRI, Cui noted",
      "\"We are expecting more high-tech enterprises from China to join the industrial park,\" Lukashenko said in an interview with the Xinhua News Agency on Monday",
      "Like-minded partnersAfter China issued its 12-point position paper on the Ukraine crisis on Friday, which has been described as \"a testimony to its peaceful foreign policy,\" Lukashenko told Xinhua that China has become a major country with an independent policy and \"not a single issue in the world can be resolved without China",
      "\"Analysts said that Belarus' support for China's position on a political settlement to the Ukraine crisis paves the way for future cooperation in multilateral frameworks such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), of which Lukashenko said he expects Belarus will become a full member in 2023",
      "But as a neighbor of Russia and Ukraine, Belarus faces a tough geopolitical situation, and the risks to its security environment are increasing",
      " If the conflict expands, Belarus could be dragged into it, experts said",
      "During his visit to China, Lukashenko is likely to exchange views with the Chinese side on the situation in Ukraine, Zhao said",
      " \"The two sides will discuss how to ease the conflict between the parties through negotiations",
      "\"Lukashenko's visit will make China better aware of Belarus' position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " It will be very constructive for China to grasp the whole situation of the crisis and play a better role in promoting a political settlement, Cui Hongjian said",
      "If the international community, including China, can play a role in promoting peace talks, it will certainly be helpful to ease the security risks of Belarus, Cui said",
      "Some Western media outlets view Lukashenko's visit through a biased lens, describing Belarus as Russia's \"little ally,\" and attempt to bind China with the two countries together to condemn them",
      " Analysts said such narrow-mindedness reflects Western political elites' insincerity and hypocrisy toward peace, as Minsk has played the role of mediator between Russia and Ukraine on multiple occasions in history",
      " At the same time, as one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, China has always played a positive role in promoting peace talks",
      "China always opposes tying the Ukraine crisis to all bilateral relations",
      " It is ridiculous to stipulate that China should not develop bilateral relations with Russia, Ukraine and Belarus because of the Ukraine crisis, Cui said",
      "China believes that the existing international trust, cooperation and stability should not be undermined because of the crisis",
      " Compared with the US' narrow choice of taking sides and sanctions, China's vision is much broader and more responsible, Cui said",
      "From China's top diplomat Wang Yi's Europe and Russia visits to Lukashenko's Beijing trip, as well as possible visits to China by French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, China will gradually find more like-minded partners to promote a political settlement to the Ukraine crisis, Cui said",
      "China and Belarus firmly support each other in safeguarding their core interests, and they also share a lot of consensus and common interests on the international stage, Zhao said",
      " \"The two sides are expected to work more closely under multilateral frameworks such as the UN and the SCO in the future to promote a more equitable international order,\" he said",

      " On the same day, the People's Daily published an article by Raisi under the Chinese title \"Old friends are the best partners for future cooperation",
      "\"The two countries established a comprehensive strategic partnership when President Xi visited Iran in January 2016",
      " After that, both sides have been striving to push forward the bilateral relations, including their cooperation under the framework of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)",

      "In his Sunday article, the Iranian president thanked China for promoting his country's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)",
      " On February 7, Raisi issued an order for implementing the law on Iran's membership in the organization, after the country signed a memorandum of commitment in September for its permanent membership in the SCO",
      "For Iran, SCO membership is a way to enhance the country's influence",
      " On the other hand, Tehran's entry into the SCO demonstrates and strengthens the organization's openness and inclusiveness, enabling the SCO to play a more significant role in the Eurasian region",
      "Moreover, it also provides another new multilateral occasion for the Middle Eastern countries to enhance mutual understanding, because, apart from Iran, other countries in the Middle East have also expressed a strong desire to strengthen ties with the SCO",

      "Compared with the US, China is capable of maintaining good relations with both Saudi Arabia and Iran, two countries that are hostile toward each other",
      " This shows that China's foreign policy which advocates independence and peace can indeed stand the test of time",
      "To be more specific, first, China does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries",
      " Second, China has always sought cooperation rather than encourage confrontation",
      " When encountering regional disputes, Beijing promotes peace talks and plays a role in easing the situation all the time",

      " US overreacts by shooting down Chinese weather balloon",
      " Cartoon: Carlos LatuffThe US Air Force shot down an \"unidentified flying object (UFO)\" over Canada on Saturday local time",
      " But officials from both Canada and the US so far have offered neither further clarification on the capabilities, purpose, or origin of the object, nor one on the need or urgency to shoot it down",
      " This approach has further aroused suspicion and hype in the US media and public opinion",
      "This is the third time in a week that the US military has shot down an object in North American airspace",
      " The US Air Force, which ranks first in the world, has mobilized troops before for UFOs, which has produced a dramatic effect in global public opinion equal to shooting a mosquito with cannon",
      " The F-22, an advanced US military fighter that has undertaken such a \"heavy task\" to attack the object, has also been dubbed the \"Balloon Killer\" on the internet",
      " Besides, the US and Canada also made a fool of themselves: The North American Aerospace Defense Command detected another radar anomaly on Saturday night",
      " The fighter jets took off again, and the airspace in Montana was closed, but it turned out to be a false alarm",
      "Although the US and Canada claimed that the UFO over Canada posed a \"reasonable threat\" to the safety of civilian flights, judging from the public opinion reaction, this reason was at least of minor importance in the decision-making process of shooting down the object",
      " Some US media said that oil field operators in the area where the incident occurred may use drones and balloons in their operations, and some US meteorologists said that a weather balloon lost contact",
      " This makes people wonder if it was the US military that messed things up",
      " However, it is clear that Washington is more concerned about the \"shooting down\" itself \u0336 both the White House and Pentagon hoped to shoot down this object as soon as possible to reduce any feeling of hesitation or weakness the outside world would have toward the US in the face of possible threats",
      " As for whether this object belongs to the US or whether it is a threat, these questions have to wait until after it is shot down",
      " This is obviously not a conventional and logical approach",
      "In periods of non-war, it is difficult for people to imagine a superpower repeatedly using advanced fighter jets to shoot down UFOs preemptively",
      " But against the atmosphere of high tension with China, this absurd and expensive large-scale political behavioral art just took place",
      " While several US media outlets have pointed out there is no indication of a link between these UFOs and China, the grand takeoff of US warplanes apparently satisfied some people's appetite for the \"China threat\" and praised the Biden administration for being \"more sober\" this time",
      " This has undoubtedly raised the cost of the Biden administration's emergency response, compressing its diplomatic and political space",
      "Illustration: Liu Rui/GTWashington's tough stance is evidently for some domestic critics",
      " The outside world does not have much interest in the US partisan affairs, but this kind of disorder has affected the country's normal decision-making",
      " It has made the US, which is in a \"stringent state\" at any time, more edgy and unpredictable",
      " In particular, some of its practices are exaggerated and bizarre to the outside world, and even a little morbid, but they make some people in the US as excited as if they are \"high on drugs",
      "\" It is not a good sign for the world if the country with the strongest military is constantly surrounded by this kind of extreme emotion and sees everything as a \"threat\" and thus wants to destroy it",
      "There are fair, reasonable, and lawful ways to deal with UFOs that appear in the airspace",
      " There are a number of internationally accepted and coordinated methods by default, and the Convention on International Civil Aviation regulates unidentified civil aircraft",
      " But Washington's approach now is to attack the so-called UFOs rashly regardless of the consequences, and even show off its force in this way",
      " This is a terrible start",
      " Especially with US public opinion fanning the flames, Washington may become even more obsessed with the misuse of force, and even simplify the authorization of the use of force",
      " This will expose civil aircraft to potential danger, including, of course, those of the US itself",
      "\"Shooting a mosquito with cannon\" is really happening in today's US",
      " If Washington is willing to spend taxpayers' money on this kind of political playacting, simply let it do it, which will only further deepen the impression that the US worships force and breaks the rules",
      " And that does not make the outside world feel the \"strength\" of the US",
      " Instead, it exposes more of its fragility and radicalism",
      " Regardless of the state in which \"every bush and tree looks like an enemy\" or \"self-directing and self-acting,\" such drama is absurd and dangerous to the world",

      " The B-21 Raider stealth bomber is unveiled at Northrop Grumman on December 2, 2022, in Palmdale, California, the US",
      " It is the first new American bomber aircraft in more than 30 years",
      " Photo: VCGThe world finally got its first glimpse on the B-21, the US' first new bomber in more than 30 years, after it made a high-profile debut in a ceremony on Friday, an event analysts said on Sunday is an attempt to flex its muscles and deter China",
      "Inheriting some selected strengths and drawing on lessons from major shortcomings of the B-2, the B-21's powerful but expensive predecessor, the new stealth bomber can be mass-produced and is more pragmatic in major power competitions, posing new challenges to the national defense of China, which is reportedly also developing a next-generation bomber of its own, Chinese experts said",
      "Held in the US Air Force's Plant 42 in Palmdale, California on Friday, the event saw the B-21 towed out of a hangar as the aircraft made its debut",
      "US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said at the event that the bomber, in development for seven years, has a long range that makes it does not need to be based in theater and a stealth capacity that means sophisticated air defense systems will struggle to detect it",
      "The B-21 is easy to maintain, and it can deliver both conventional and nuclear munitions, is built with an open-system architecture which makes it highly adaptable, and it can also carry out intelligence gathering and battle management missions, according to Austin",
      "Judged by its appearance, the B-21 still uses a flying wing design like the B-2, but it has several changes in details that will significantly enhance the bomber's stealth capability, including reducing its radar cross-section and becoming evasive to more radio frequency bands, Zhang Xuefeng, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "With the enhanced stealth, the B-21 will receive a stronger capability in defense penetration, which allows it to drop inexpensive stand-in munitions in large numbers directly above targets, Zhang said",
      " This is cheaper than using non-stealth aircraft launching expensive, long-range standoff missiles, he said",
      "One of the main reasons why the B-21 was developed is that the B-2 is too expensive to build and to maintain, another Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "The B-21 is smaller and lighter than the B-2, and uses only two engines instead of four",
      " These result in decreases in range and payload capacity, but in return it is allegedly more cost-effective friendlier, with the US Air Force planning to procure around 100 units, compared with around 20 B-2 aircraft, the expert said",
      "Since the B-21 was revealed, US media reports were quick to spin connections with China, with analysts saying that the move is aimed at deterring China and gaining sufficient funds for follow-up developments",
      "The B-21 is a part of the Pentagon's efforts to modernize all three legs of its nuclear triad, which includes silo-launched nuclear ballistic missiles and submarine-launched warheads, as it shifts from the counterterrorism campaigns of recent decades to meet China's rapid military modernization, AP reported on Saturday",
      "A large fleet of B-21s will pose new challenges to China's air defense, as they can launch sneak attacks from more directions, taking advantage of their stealth capabilities: not only from the West Pacific, but also from the South China Sea, and even territorial airspaces of Southeast and South Asian countries as well as countries in the Middle East, Chinese experts said",
      " In those sneak attacks, the US bombers could target Chinese command centers, bases, airfields and missile facilities, creating breaches in the anti-access and area denial systems of the Chinese military, they warned",
      "To counter the B-21s, China can attack the airfields from which the US bombers are based with own bombers, and China has whatever it takes to build a similar bomber to the B-21, Zhang said",
      "China has repeatedly hinted at the development of its own next-generation bomber reportedly called the H-20, which is expected to also have a flying wing aerodynamic design like the B-2 and the B-21",
      "The B-21 is expected to make its first flight in 2023, AP reported",
      " However, given the precedent of delays as well as cost hikes of the B-2, the F-22 and the F-35, the future of the B-21 may not go as smoothly as planned, observers said",

      " Photo: VCGThe powerful earthquakes that occurred in southern Turkey on Monday caused severe casualties in Turkey and Syria",
      " In the face of serious natural disasters, human society has revealed its fragile and resilient sides",
      " After the earthquake, many countries and regions around the world, including China, have expressed their condolences and provided help to Turkey and Syria",
      " It is worth mentioning that Sweden, which recently has had tense relations with Turkey, and Israel, an \"old enemy\" of Syria, have temporarily put aside their political differences and actively participated in disaster relief efforts",
      " This has created a moving scene where the two countries in need have gained global support",
      "Turkey and Syria, particularly the latter, have long been spots of conflict in international geopolitics",
      " Syria has already experienced the chronic pain of years of turmoil and war, and strong earthquakes are really intensifying the pain",
      " The international community should strive to reach the common goal of providing timely help to the victims and preventing a more serious humanitarian disaster from happening due to the earthquake",
      " Thus, the international community, especially the major powers, needs to achieve unity and coordination at a larger level",

      " This kind of understanding, which has been gained at a tragic cost, is invaluable and should be widely and firmly practiced in human society",

      " Recently, humanity has faced common challenges, one after another, ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to regional conflicts to climate change",
      " However, it has not facilitated the formation of the true solidarity necessary to deal with global issues",
      " The dysfunction of relations between major powers, the disorder of the international order, and the imbalance of global governance are the more profound crisis of human society at present, wasting the disasters and sufferings that humanity has endured time and again",
      "Many people have the same feeling that since entering the third decade of the 21st century, international relations seem to have fallen into the quagmire of accelerated regression",
      " Whether it is populism and trade protectionism in the economic field, or zero-sum game and geopolitical conflicts in the international political field, they are all escalating and an inertia that is continuously deteriorating has even been formed",
      " Against this background, it is even more valuable for countries around the world to jointly support Turkey and Syria to resist disasters; but this kind of unity should not only be short-lived in the face of a sudden global crisis",
      " We hope it can continue to warm the world",
      "Needless to say, there isn't much optimism on how long the current unity or harmony can last",
      " Just a few days before the earthquake, some Western countries including the US, the UK, Germany and France temporarily closed their consulates in Istanbul or issued security warnings about Turkey citing \"security concerns,\" triggering fierce protests in Turkey, which can be called a \"diplomatic earthquake",
      "\" The matter has not been resolved",
      " It is conceivable that in the land where the earthquake occurred, disaster relief and post-disaster reconstruction may still encounter obstacles and resistance at the geopolitical level",
      "And we still need to mention Syria, a country that has been suffering from war for more than a decade, which has caused more damage than an earthquake",
      " However, it is regrettable that the US still cannot let go of its geopolitical obsession at this moment, and has ruled out any possibility of contacting the Syrian government",
      " But as we all know, the Syrian government is the main executor of the post-earthquake rescue operations",
      " Meanwhile, Washington has also ignored calls to lift sanctions on Syria \"immediately\" so that aid can be provided",
      "The Chinese sci-fi movie The Wandering Earth 2, which is currently being screened, shows that true unity and cooperation can be achieved when the entire human race is at a critical juncture of life and death and will be destroyed if humanity doesn't unite",
      " We hope that in the real world we will not wait until the last minute to be forced to make a choice, but will be one step ahead, and take the initiative as soon as possible",
      "Every time after a disaster, people sympathize with the victims from the bottom of their hearts, and sincerely hope to provide help as much as they can",
      " It is a shining part of universal humanity",
      " It allows us to see the deep strength of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and be confident that the world will eventually become a better and warmer place",

      " This appears to be a conflict without end",
      "China doesn't see it that way",
      " With the release of a statement on Friday, China has made several suggestions: The first one applies to all parties, including Russia -respect the sovereignty of all countries",
      " The next applies to the US: abandon your cold war mentality and work together for peace and stability",
      " So far, with two suggestions down, this is looking like a very well-thought-out statement",
      "There are 10 other points, the next two make sense: cease hostilities and resume peace talks",
      " China will continue to play a constructive role in this process",
      " The next two points speak of the human side, they are to resolve the humanitarian crisis and to protect civilians and prisoners of war",
      " China calls on both parties to facilitate exchanges and the UN to ensure the crisis already in place can't escalate further",
      "So far, this is all sensible, rational and appropriate, is there a person in the world who can't agree to these kinds of statements?The next two points are vital if the world is to remain a viable home for mankind -keep nuclear power plants safe so as to avoid any man-made disasters and reduce strategic risks, in other words, don't escalate this war into a nuclear war which should never be fought and will never be won",
      "The next three points are more global and important for the future of a great number of countries",
      " Facilitate grain exports, both Russia and Ukraine are exporters of food to the \"Global South,\" one of the (presumably) unintended consequences of this war is food shortages in places where people already go short",
      " End unilateral sanctions, especially when those sanctions are not authorized by the UN",
      " As China points out, unilateral sanctions don't help the people they claim to help and there is only one country in the world applying them",
      "China also calls for industry and supply chains to be kept stable",
      " Sanctions on Russian gas haven't hurt Russia, they're still selling gas but the supply is no longer stable and the prices are no longer cheap",
      " Countries that are not involved in the conflict, including China and India, are able to buy, sell and ship gas but as a result of the process the prices increase and reliability of supply is not so stable",
      " This brings no benefit to countries such as Germany, which are heavily dependent on that supply but these issues have certainly benefitted the US who now sell gas to Europe at massive profit",
      "Finally, the last point is an important one, and that is to help rebuilding in \"post-conflict zones",
      "\" This should be done in a humanitarian and not in a profit-making way and China stands ready to provide assistance",
      "China is doing what it always does and the end result could hugely benefit innocent people caught up in this conflict, the military personnel dying in it and the millions of people affected by it",
      " Perhaps it's time to pay more attention to the patterns",

      "Photo:CFP/MANJUNATH KIRANJapan and India on Monday launched their first joint fighter jet exercise, a move analysts said exposed the two countries' growing military ambitions against China under the instigation of the US",
      "The 11-day Veer Guardian-23 aerial maneuvers are scheduled to run until January 26 in the airspace around the Japan Air Self-Defense Force's Hyakuri and Iruma air bases in Ibaraki Prefecture, the Japan Times reported on Monday",
      "The drills aim to continue deepening defense and security ties between Japan and India amid China's growing capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region, the report claimed",
      "Analysts said that the joint exercise is a reflection of the two countries' long-known and expanding military ambitions",
      "Having spent a lot in military equipment procurement, India wants to display its presence as a major country by showing off its military capabilities outside the Indian Ocean, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times on Monday",
      "Japan, on the other hand, welcomed Indian fighters to its soil so it can in return send its warplanes to visit India in the future",
      " This will allow Japan to expand its armed forces' sphere of activity to other parts of the world, now that the country has broken away from its \"self-defense only\" principle, Wei said",
      "Both Japan and India are being lured by the US to join its Indo-Pacific strategy in containing China, with Japan planning to interfere in the Taiwan question militarily and India involved in border issues with China, observers said",
      "From a strategic point of view, despite the joint drills, if a conflict breaks out involving either Japan or India, neither country is likely to have the strategic will or sufficient capability to enter combat, but China should stay on alert and prepare for any eventuality that may arise, analysts said",
      "In the Veer Guardian-23 exercise, the Indian contingent includes four Su-30MKI multirole fighters, two C-17 Globemaster transport planes, one Il-78 aerial tanker and about 150 personnel, while the Japan Air Self-Defense Force will field four F-2s and an equal number of F-15 multirole fighters, the Japan Times reported",
      "The joint training could help the Japan Air Self-Defense Force \"draw lessons from the extensive operational experience of the Indian Air Force,\" particularly with regards to China, and the technical innovations it has achieved in its fighters, especially with the Su-30MKI fighters taking part in the exercise, the report cited an India-based defense analyst as saying",
      "The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) operates the Su-30MKK, the Su-30MK2, the Su-35, the J-11, the J-15 and the J-16, which are all fighters derived from the Russian Su-27, like India's Su-30MKI, as they share some basic characteristics, observers said",
      "However, experts pointed out that the Su-30MKI is specially customized for India, and the versions imported by China are different from the Indian version, not to mention those that are self-developed by China using domestic technologies",

      " China US File Photo:CFPAt the request of the US side, China's top diplomat Wang Yi held an informal meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday local time on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) where the Chinese official urged the US side to correct its mistakes as its handling of the recent airship incident has damaged to China-US relations",
      "Wang, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, stated China's solemn position on the airship incident, and told Blinken that the US should face up to and fix the damage inflicted on bilateral relations after the US abused its force and shot down a Chinese civilian airship that strayed into US airspace due to force majeure, according to a statement on the website of the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Sunday",
      "On Saturday, Wang blasted Washington's reaction to the balloon incident, calling its handling of the matter \"hysterical,\" and apparently violating international norms and conventions",
      " Considering that the US handling of the incident has caused damage to the bilateral ties, arranging such interaction amid a deteriorating atmosphere was not easy, some Chinese observers said",
      " But the Chinese side still accepted the request from the US side from the point of view of stabilizing the bilateral ties, which will be conducive to the global stability",
      "\"The informal contact means that the two sides hold open attitude to meet but without high expectations for reaching a consensus on certain subject,\" Sun Chenghao, a research fellow from the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "China's position on the US is consistent, as we have been urging it to correct its mistakes because the US side has put in place provocative polices on many fronts",
      " If they really want the US-China relations to return to the correct track, the US side needs to show more sincerity, Sun said",
      "During the MSC, Wang told the audience when asked about the China-US relations that the airship incident is actually a political farce created by the US",
      " The US ignored the basic facts and dispatched military jets to shoot down a non-threatening airship with missile, which is unbelievable, almost hysterical and absolutely an abuse of force, clearly violating relevant international conventions",
      "\"China will never accept this and has lodged strong protests with the US,\" Wang said",
      " There are many balloons floating above the Earth every day, is the US going to shoot them all down? The Chinese diplomat asked",
      "Wang also noted that the underlying reason behind this incident is that the US has engaged in misunderstanding and strategic misjudgments when it comes to China",
      "China's US policy is clear and transparent, that is mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation",
      " On the back of these principles, China is willing to work with the US to jointly explore how major powers of different systems can coexist with each other",
      " However, the US response is China constitutes a severe \"geopolitical challenge,\" a \"long-term competitor\" or even a \"threat",
      "\"Built on an incorrect perception of China, the US is using all means to crack down on China and coerce other countries to follow suit, Wang continued",
      "Under such circumstances, China is still willing to communicate with the US, which also showed that China hopes to stabilize the bilateral ties from the point of view of safeguarding the global peace, security and prosperity, Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "\"But it does not mean that China-US relations will return to normal",

      " A picture released by the Danish Defence Command shows the gas leak at the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline seen from the Danish F-16 interceptor on Bornholm, Denmark on September 27, 2022",
      " Photo: AFPChina on Wednesday called for an objective and fair investigation into the Nord Stream pipeline sabotage and to speed up the investigation, suggesting that the UN - the most authoritative and representative international organization - could play an active and constructive role on the matter",
      "However, some observers warned that it will be difficult for UN Security Council or UN Secretariat to conduct the investigation as they need to show a collective decision-making process, which may yield to the US-led Western pressure",
      "Russia and the US as well as other Western countries clashed on Tuesday over the Kremlin's call for a UN investigation into the sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines",
      " Russian envoy to the UN Vassily Nebenzia told the UN Security Council that Moscow has \"no trust\" in the separate investigations being carried out by Denmark, Sweden and Germany, AP reported",
      "The pipelines carrying natural gas from Russia to Europe exploded on the same day under the Baltic Sea on September 26, 2022, causing large amounts of gas to leak into the waters and significantly affecting Europe's energy supply",
      " The explosion of the pipelines, which are also part of the world's most important transnational energy supply infrastructure, have become an extreme event that shocked the world, especially after veteran US investigative journalist Seymour Hersh released an article accusing the US of being behind the incident",
      "On Friday, Russia submitted a draft resolution to the UN Security Council to investigate the blasts, suggesting that the UN Secretary General create an independent international commission of lawyers to investigate the sabotage, TASS said",
      "\"As the most authoritative and representative international organization, the UN can play an active role in conducting an international investigation and ensuring the security of transboundary infrastructure,\" Zhang Jun, Chinese envoy to the UN, said at the UN Security Council briefing on the matter on Tuesday",
      "He noted that China welcomes the draft resolution tabled by Russia in the council, and believes that it is of great significance to authorize an international investigation into the sabotage",
      "Circumstances show the incident is not an accident but deliberate sabotage, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a press briefing on Wednesday",
      " If we do not find the truth about the incident and the relevant party behind it, it will give more opportunities to those ill-intentioned people to conduct more terrorist acts, delivering a heavy blow to global security, Wang said",
      "The spokesperson echoed the Chinese envoy to the UN, saying that it is necessary to support and accelerate the investigative process and find the truth, on which the UN can play an active and constructive role",
      "\"The Nord Stream blasts were not only economic and livelihood problems but also a political issue which concerns the overall security and stability of Europe",
      " Particularly on the backdrop of the Ukraine crisis, the incident undoubtedly escalated the tensions in the region, making the negotiation and dialogue more difficult and the construction of a balanced, effective and sustainable EU security structure more challenging,\" Wang said",
      "While Russia and China are calling on the UN to play a leading role in conducting the investigation, some experts believe that the international organization where major countries have been wrestling would be limited in its efforts, thereby making the Nord Stream sabotage an unsolved mystery",
      "\"The UN has been under the influence of major countries, especially after the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " The UN General Assembly, for example, has become a stage for a political containment by the US-led West,\" Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Wednesday",
      "While it is practical for the UN Security Council to lead the investigation, it is difficult to collect evidence and hold relevant parties accountable as there is no international legal institution for this purpose, Cui said",
      " \"The UN Security Council and Secretariat need to show the principle of collective decision-making process in which the US and other countries may vote against an investigation",
      "\"China released its Global Security Initiative Concept Paper on Tuesday, which highlights the role of the UN, saying that the authority of the UN and its status as the main platform for global security governance should be upheld",
      "Some Chinese experts laid out how the UN could potentially launch an investigation",
      " For example, the UN Security Council passes a resolution and forms an investigative team",
      " \"Or relevant countries, such as Germany and Norway, submit the probe results to the council which will decide if it takes any further action,\" Tang Bei, associate professor at the school of international relations and public affairs at Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Wednesday",
      "\"There's another possibility that the Nord Stream blasts would become another 'Cheonan sinking' - an unsettled case without clear findings,\" Tang said, referring to the sinking of a South Korean navy ship in 2010, which Seoul claimed was fired on by North Korea",
      "The most authoritative way is for the council to form an investigative team, but under the escalated conflict between the US and Russia, it is unlikely that the council would pass such a resolution, she said",

      "However, in remarks to online video channel Freedom, Podolyak said that some of Ukraine's Western partners maintain a \"conservative\" attitude to arms deliveries, \"due to fear of changes in the international architecture",
      "\"Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday that \"Kiev will always pay efforts to drag its NATO allies to directly fight with Russian troops in Ukraine, as this is probably the only way for Kiev to turn around the current situation",
      " But Washington is not stupid, so it won't be used by Kiev, but will keep using Kiev to undermine Moscow",
      "\"Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times on Sunday that \"if Ukraine eventually receives weapons like F-16 fighter jets, armed by NATO members, and long-range missiles, as well as main battle tanks, then Kiev will be able to launch counterattacks in some regions that are currently controlled by Russian troops",
      "\" This could happen before the end of this winter or a period of time after the winter, Wei said",
      "Danger of 'World War'Song said that \"Russia won't wait and see Ukraine troops to get fully armed by those NATO weapons,\" so Russian troops will likely launch a new round of major offensive to maximize their advantage and victory before the situation gets more difficult in the future",
      "Chair of the NATO Military Committee Bauer's statement that \"NATO is ready for direct confrontation with Russia\" is actually a clear message from the West that NATO won't get involved directly as long as Russia keeps its \"military operation\" within Ukraine, experts said",
      "But now some NATO members like Poland are actually taking their own action to reinforce Ukraine, and this will create more uncertainty if Russia's potential major military offensive also cause huge casualties to the NATO members' military personnel in Ukraine, analysts said",
      "Another problem is that if Russia cannot achieve major military victory before NATO military assistance to fully armed Ukrainian forces, Ukraine could bring great losses to the Russian side in Crimea and other regions within Russian territory, and then Moscow will have to retaliate heavily, and this would cause escalation for sure, Song noted",
      "\"As long as NATO gets involved more directly, the situation would immediately turn into a confrontation between NATO and Russia, and the outbreak of World War III in Europe would become an event with high possibility,\" Song said",

      "China is now promoting economic recovery with full steam",
      " The prevailing view is that China's reopening will help boost confidence in world economic growth and bolster global economic recovery",
      " Recently, many international investment institutions have revised up their forecast for China's economic growth rate in 2023",
      " For example, the International Monetary Fund has raised its forecast for China's economic growth to 5",
      "2 percent in 2023",
      "China's victory in the fight against the epidemic is obviously something that the Western media and elites do not want to see",
      " They are even less willing to let the people in their own countries realize that China has done a better job fighting the epidemic than Western government",
      "For instance, in an opinion article published in the New York Times this week titled \"It's as if nothing ever happened here in China,\" the author reluctantly admitted that \"China now says the wave has peaked, and that may be true",
      " Pharmacy shelves are no longer bare",
      " Even Paxlovid has become more available, and I don't hear about overwhelmed hospitals anymore",
      "\" But the author still tried to emphasized that \"scars from the past few weeks remain",
      "\"In addition to unwillingness to admit China's great achievement in anti-epidemic fight, some countries are implementing discriminatory entry restriction measures against travelers from China, such as France, which has extended mandatory COVID tests for travelers from China until February 15",
      "The US and some Western countries evaluate the epidemic situation in China not from the perspective of science, but for discrediting China's image",
      " In fact, they look at all issues related to China with an unhealthy mentality of civilizational superiority",
      " When China has entered the state of normalcy, they are pretending to be on high alert, in order to show they are superior",
      " To be honest, it's a pathetic mindset",
      "The US was one of the first countries to enter a state of coexistence with COVID-19 since the outbreak began",
      " In September last year, President Joe Biden publicly said that \"the pandemic is over",
      "\" On January 30, he announced that the White House would terminate on May 11 both the public health and national emergencies declared in response to COVID",
      " Against this background, why did the US impose so-called travel restrictions on China? The reason is nothing more than to find a new means for the old routine of isolating China in the post-epidemic era",
      "In recent years, the internal crisis of national racism in the US has deepened",
      " The Biden administration passed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to crack down on the frequent attacks against Asians since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic",
      " If Washington still insists on such a restrictive policy, it will become a new trigger to arouse xenophobia, which will do nothing but harm to future exchanges between China and the US",
      "Such an approach is also not in line with public opinion around the world",
      " There is a growing desire for economic recovery and a return to good, peaceful, open international exchanges and globalized life",
      " In fact, the majority of the American people want to resume normal interactions and exchanges with China, to be able to come to China to travel, do business, and participate in cultural and academic exchanges, etc",
      " Discriminatory restrictions are deepening the impediments to international exchange, and even bringing unwarranted ideological intimidation to the American public",
      "With the global economy in desperate need of recovery, why is the US' ideology toward China continuing down a path of intense confrontation? It is hard not to suspect that such measures are not only a farce but a conspiracy, and that US politicians are manipulating epidemic as a tool to attack China, rather than caring about the well-being of the people on both sides",

      " Illustration: Liu Rui/GTIf you want to make a prediction on the trajectory of Washington's policy toward China, the Chinese balloon that recently floated to the US is a good \"test",
      "\"The meteorological research balloon's sudden appearance over the US at a time of ongoing tension and uncertainty in US-China relations has triggered a variety of reactions from the US side, from the White House to Congress, from the media to the public",
      " The information revealed therein can be gathered together to give a more realistic assessment of the air pressure, temperature, and weather conditions of the US policy toward China",
      "This \"test\" is not intentional on behalf of any party, but it is precisely this unexpectedness that makes the results of this test even more accurate",
      "After Biden took over the White House, US-China relations have shown an even sharper downhill trend",
      " Although the US side has shown interest in increasing communication and strengthening management so far this year, it has remained largely verbal",
      "In terms of curbing high-tech exports to China and strengthening military deployments around China, Washington is still moving forward with its so-called competition strategy with China step-by-step, and uncertainty in the bilateral relationship is increasing",
      "The prevailing concern is whether the future US-China relationship can maintain a manageable operation in an extreme climate and under possible high-pressure shocks",
      "At this juncture in time, the balloon incident happened unexpectedly",
      "The US' response on three levels reveals the potential for continued deterioration but also the possibility of stability at the present level in the US-China relationship",
      "The first level is that of radical congressional and military figures who hold strong hostile sentiment toward China",
      " They have deliberately exaggerated the incident and \"manufactured\" it as further evidence of a Chinese military threat",
      " Some have given full play to the imagination of China as an enemy, making it appear that China's military capabilities are fully surpassing those of the US and could win a future war with the US",
      "The US media, as a second level, quickly \"amplified\" the story into a global media headline",
      " While there was some objective reporting, most media outlets used it to play up China's hostility toward the US",
      " Some media outlets also rehashed old historical accounts, retelling the story of Japan's World War II high-altitude balloon bombs",
      "In May 1945, a bomb hanging from a tree in Kansas exploded, killing six people",
      " This was the only civilian casualty on US soil during World War II",
      " An investigation afterward proved that the bomb was delivered to the US by a Japanese-made balloon",
      "However, an American friend told me that most Americans are not as rich in their ability to make associations, and they see the incident more as news for after-dinner gossip",
      " In this regard, the people of the two countries mainly have the same opinions",
      " Chinese people are also more concerned about the drama of the incident",
      " Jokes went viral in WeChat groups, not some fearful sentiment that China and the US are going to fight against each other",
      "Some people made jokes saying that it was because the US curbed the export of high-end chips to China, and Chinese balloons lacked chips, were not precise enough, and lost their way, so it \"wandered\"",
      "In fact, the ordinary people on both sides have a better understanding of the relationship between the two countries than some politicians, experts, or military personnel, and the balloon incident and the reactions it has triggered since then have not, by and large, exceeded the framework of their perception of the current state of bilateral relations",
      "After all, balloons used for weather research are not strategic weapons, and the reality of US-China relations has not reached the level of US-Soviet tensions during the Cold War",
      " At that time, both the US and the Soviet Union had used air defense systems to shoot down thousands of each other's balloons",
      "A further look at the White House's several statements on the incident still seems to indicate that Washington exercised some restraint",
      " In fact, both the US and China have exercised considerable restraint at the government level, and both are interested in not allowing the balloon incident to trigger an escalation in the deterioration of relations",
      " This is probably the most important point of this test",
      "Washington's performance in this case is more of a \"political show\" and while it will not quickly reverse its strategic course of continuing to compete with China, it is still willing to manage its differences through coordination to prevent direct \"military conflict",
      "\" The next challenge is whether the US-China relationship will enter a phase of relative stability, and to some extent, how much the White House can control or coordinate with the Congress, to avoid the disruptions",

      " CNN also stated that while people are focusing on China's spy balloon, the threat to the US and allies from the Chinese telecommunications equipment giant Huawei should not be ignored",
      "The intention of the US is very obvious",
      " In addition to strategically blocking China's high-tech development, it is also trying to completely ban Chinese high-tech products in the European market and replace them with American products",
      " If such a strategic, selfish behavior is realized, the result may be Europe's loss, with the Europe-China economic relationship significantly weakened, and the US ultimately greatly benefiting",
      "Although the US continues to exert pressure on its European allies, asking them not to use Huawei technology in the construction of their 5G networks, the reality is that business leaders and decision-makers in European countries have not blindly followed the US",
      " Many European countries still use Chinese equipment",
      " Germany is increasingly relying on Huawei for 5G",
      "A recent study conducted by telecom consulting company Strand Consult on Huawei's market share in Europe estimates that Germany relies on Chinese technology for 59 percent of its 5G networks",
      " Large European countries, including Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Austria, and Spain, continue to buy significant amounts of Chinese 5G kit",
      "In fact, it is difficult for Europe to give up cooperation with Huawei, not only because of its practical economic needs, but also because long-term use of Huawei products has generated trust, which Washington cannot destroy no matter how hard it hypes",
      " This time, Huawei equipment is used near the MSC venue, which fully demonstrates that Huawei 5G equipment does not pose security threats",
      " The US' suppression and containment of Chinese technology has so far been unsuccessful",
      "Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times that what the US is doing to Huawei now is very similar to what it did to the Nord Stream pipelines",
      " By destroying the Nord Stream pipelines, the US cut off the economic and geopolitical link between Russia and Europe, driving out Russian energy from the European market, and allowing American energy to replace it",
      " Washington is now seeking to do the same for China in general and Huawei in particular",
      "Ironically, some US telecom networks continue to use Huawei equipment and benefit from Huawei's low prices and high-quality products",
      " However, Washington is now asking its European allies to cut their ties with Huawei, once again presenting a typical and hypocritical double standard",
      "\"Some US media and politicians have spared no effort to suppress and discredit China",
      " 'Their mentality is clear \u0336 , they do not want a real \"cool down\" between China and the US",
      " Instead, they expect to see China-US relations dragged down,\" Li said",
      "For some American elites, the mere mention of China seems to touch a nerve and even trigger anxiety and unease",
      " They are anxious all day long about China's booming development momentum as well as the influence of its system and ideology",
      " They cannot realize that the crux of the anxiety lies in the US itself, not China",
      " If the US elites continue to hype the \"China threat,\" the damage will be all-around",
      "This will make it more challenging to make any improvements to the US government's China policy",
      " What's more, if the US policy toward China blindly seeks conflict and confrontation, the result will be a serious setback in China-US relations, increasingly acute regional and global security issues, and more difficult or even impossible cooperation on climate change and infectious diseases, which are common challenges mankind has to face",
      " This damages not only the well-being of the US itself, but also the interests of the whole world",
      "The final result of the dangerous operation of sacrificing interests of its own people and even the entire world in pursuit of the hegemonic position or the self-interest of a specific interest group will be displayed in a very destructive way",

      " Photo:VCGUS President Joe Biden made a surprise visit on Monday to Ukrainian capital Kiev, the first time since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began about a year ago",
      " Chinese experts saw the visit as a \"symbolic\" gesture to pressure Ukraine to make progress during the crisis, so as to gain domestic support for aiding Kiev",
      "However, observers called the trip \"irrational and selfish,\" while disregarding that the visit may trigger a more aggressive counterstrike from Russia",
      "Biden arrived in Kiev at 8 am local time, CNN cited reporters traveling with him inside Ukraine as saying, and was greeted by the US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink",
      " His motorcade arrived at the Mariinsky Palace just after 8:30 am local time",
      " He was greeted at the entrance by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his wife, Olena Zelenska",
      " He departed Kiev in the early afternoon, according to BBC",
      "As Russia prepares for a \"spring offensive,\" Biden needs to boost morale for Ukraine and Zelensky, and to ask Western allies to give Ukraine more military aid, said Wang Xiaoquan, an expert from the Institute of Russian, East European and Central Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences",
      "However, he noted that Biden's visit will not only have little impact on the battlefield, it will also trigger a more aggressive counterstrike from Russia",
      "Making an unannounced visit to Ukraine on the eve of the first anniversary of the conflict, Biden aims to pressure Ukraine to make progress on the battlefield, so as to convince Americans back home to continue supporting Kiev, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times",
      "Recent polling showed that 48 percent of Americans support sending weapons to Ukraine, a significant drop from the 60 percent of support in May 2022, US media The Hill reported on Sunday",
      "The year-long conflict has also seen European countries showing fatigue in continuing to stand against Russia",
      " French President Emmanuel Macron suggested over the weekend that Russia should be \"defeated but not crushed\" and that the conflict in Ukraine would have to be settled by negotiations",
      "Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, called Biden's visit a largely symbolic one as the US leader had previously avoided visiting Ukraine, partly to prevent Washington from getting bogged down too deeply in the conflict",
      " Now, with declining domestic and international support, Diao said Biden chose the one-year anniversary for his visit to keep adding fuel to the conflict, in the hope that Russia will be weakened",
      "Experts said the dangerous signals sent from this trip will escalate the conflict",
      " Apparently, Biden is pushing Ukraine to act as a pawn to defeat Russia, but the goal is dangerous and irrational, said Li, noting that the US is adding fuel to the fire of an already tense situation, and the conflict may further escalate and get out of control",
      "In joint remarks alongside Zelensky, Biden announced half a billion US dollars in assistance to Ukraine, saying the package would include more military equipment, including artillery ammunition, more javelins and Howitzers",
      "Zelensky added that he and Biden spoke about \"long range weapons and the weapons that may still be supplied to Ukraine even though it wasn't supplied before",
      "\"Diao said that the aid won't be a game-changer",
      " \"There's long way from announcement to the money being delivered to Ukraine, as it has to pass legislation and may face filibusters from Congress and the House of Representatives",
      " How much will actually be delivered remains a question,\" said Diao",
      "Biden's message to Zelensky is that Ukraine has the US' full support, but what we can see right now is that many weapons promised by Western countries to Ukraine have not arrived, thus an abrupt military operation from Ukraine will come at the cost of more Ukrainian soldiers, said Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator",
      "US media outlet Politico reported last week that Ukraine is still waiting for promised deliveries of modern tanks from Western countries",
      " Combat jets, though much discussed, are mired in government hesitation",
      "Moreover, we know that when the US enters an election cycle, presidents tend to stage shows to respond to voters' requests and attention from domestic audiences, so Biden's Kiev trip can also be seen as a show, according to Diao",

      " Photo: Liu Xuanzun/GTA promotional video released by the Chinese aviation industry on Tuesday featured computer generated images showing what analysts said on Wednesday could represent a concept of the country's next-generation fighter jet, which reflects China's determination to outpace the US in new warplane development",
      "The video, published in the WeChat video channel of the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), introduced China's airborne radar development and featured near its end a computer-generated clip showing three unknown aircraft flying in formation",
      "The aircraft looked like the J-20 stealth fighter jet, but with no canards, tails or fins, and the diamond-shaped wings appeared bigger than those of the J-20, giving it what seems to be a blended wing-body configuration, observers said, who also speculated that it might be China's next-generation fighter jet",
      "At the Airshow China 2022 held in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province in November 2022, AVIC put on display a concept model of a next-generation fighter jet, which also had a tailless design like the aircraft shown in the latest video",
      "Other countries are also conducting research and development into next-generation fighter jets, and tailless designs similar to the one shown by China are some of the most popular concepts, Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military aviation expert, told the Global Times on Wednesday",
      "A tailless design will give the next-generation, or the sixth-generation, fighter jet superior stealth capability in all directions than current fifth-generation ones, and a blended wing body design will provide higher lift, longer range and lower fuel consumption",
      " However, without vertical tails, the new aircraft will lose out on maneuverability if it does not use other designs or technologies to compensate, like thrust vectoring control-capable engines and split brake rudders, or other innovative approaches, analysts said",
      "With the project name Next Generation Air Dominance, the US' next-generation fighter jet might also use a tailless design, according to a computer-generated rendering by US military warplane contractor Lockheed Martin, US news website Defense News reported in September 2022",
      "Based on the information available now, China has started research and development in terms of the next-generation fighter jet, and it is in a confident place to eventually outpace the US, Fu said",

      " Illustration: Liu Rui/GTIn the context in which US domestic politics has deteriorated, the country's handling of the balloon incident has evidently entered a state of political playacting driven by the country's domestic politics",
      " Instead of respecting facts, the US' rhetoric over the matter sounds like weaving a plot for a novel or a Hollywood movie",
      "US media reported that the country's intelligence officials groundlessly believe that the recently recovered so-called Chinese spy balloon is part of an extensive surveillance program run by the Chinese military, having conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years",
      " This program \"has violated the sovereignty of countries across five continents,\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken claimed on Wednesday",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans are already preparing for the 2024 presidential elections, attempting to amplify every matter that can be used to gain political capital",
      "According to L\u00fc Xiang, an expert on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, by exaggerating the global threat of a Chinese civilian airship used for research, on the one hand, the Biden administration intends to accuse and blame its Republican predecessor's failure to deal with the \"China threat",
      "\" And on the other, it is also a powerful counterattack to the Republican Party's recent attack on the Democrats' weak response toward China, especially at the beginning of the balloon incident",
      "Both parties seem to be competing over which one is more aggressive in terms of being hawkish on anti-China",
      " Using the balloon incident as a pretext, the Biden administration is trying to show its domestic audience its efforts in solidifying and expanding a global anti-China front by spreading a fictitious narrative unfavorable to China, in a bid to gain more support at home",
      " Such exaggeration is only part of the US public opinion war",
      "Balloons for meteorological purposes have been used by many countries, and it is not uncommon for them to occasionally drift into the airspace of another country",
      " The US government has received over 350 new reports of what the US government terms \"unidentified aerial phenomenon,\" commonly known as UFOs, since March of 2021 - roughly half of which are so far unexplained, according to media reports in January",
      " Instead, Washington did not sensationalize these cases, to a sharp contrary to its response to China's airship this time",
      " Some US politicians' practices in hyping the balloon incident for political ends are neither wise nor appropriate",
      "At the initial stage of detecting the airship, Pentagon said the so-called spy balloon \"does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground,\" or a significant intelligence-gathering risk",
      " Today, such a matter has been accused not only as a threat to the national security of the US, but of five continents",
      " The reverse is utterly absurd",
      "Lu Shaye, the Chinese Ambassador to France, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview that \"Such incident should have been managed through the communication between the two sides in a quiet way and without affecting the mutual trust, as similar matters happened often in the past and there's no need to exaggerate it",
      "\" He also told French news channel LCI on Monday that balloons from other countries had previously strayed into Chinese airspace, citing media reports and discussions on social media, but said Beijing had preferred to deal with them in a \"low-key\" manner",
      "China's approach in dealing with such incidents demonstrates to the world that China proceeds from the facts and handles such unexpected foreign affairs from the standpoint of world peace and development",
      " This indicates that China is a firm force for world peace, while it is difficult for the US to have such a broad mind",
      "Washington has a load of overseas military bases and instigates conflicts and hostility among various forces globally at every turn, triggering turmoil in the world",
      " The US is the most unstable factor in international security",
      " It is ridiculous for such a country to use a civil balloon to play up the \"China threat\" to the world, and its attempt to confuse the public is unlikely to succeed",
      "The US' hype over the balloon incident has been around for a week",
      " Except for NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, few top leaders of some countries and international or regional organizations have publicly echoed the US",
      " As NATO is merely a US military tool, Stoltenberg's remarks over this matter are of no value",
      " Countries like Venezuela even condemned US practices - The US once again \"resorts to the use of force\" against a device that didn't represent any military or physical threat to people on the ground, according to a Venezuela Foreign Ministry statement",

      "When meeting with Zelensky, French president Emmanuel Macron said France hasn't ruled out sending fighter jets, but he set conditions, such as guaranteeing that it will not lead to an escalation of tensions, the aircraft will not be used \"to touch Russian soil,\" and it will not result in weakening \"the capacities of the French army",
      "\"Song believed that apart from concerns over stirring up the conflict, Western countries are also worried that providing Ukraine with fighter jets will weaken their own air forces",

      " \"This is especially obvious now in Europe, with countries competing to offer military equipment to Ukraine to demonstrate their diplomatic influence,\" Zhang Hong, associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times",

      "2: Using 'hegemonic stability theory' to create world turmoilThe Western international political discourse has created concepts such as \"Security dilemma,\" \"Thucydides trap\" and \"Kindleberger trap\" for decades, which all served the same purpose - the continued stability of hegemony",
      "However, there is a huge gap between concept and reality",
      " The narrative of \"peace\" and \"development\" has never been absent in US statement, but it has become an illusion in the US' pursuit of hegemony, and even become a tool to promote hegemony",
      "Looking back during the 30 years since the end of the Cold War, the world could have enjoyed a promising \"long-term peace,\" but humanity has not enjoyed real peace and tranquility and is still experiencing ongoing conflicts and crises",
      "After the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US and Europe provided military aid to Ukraine, and used their financial hegemony to impose the severest economic and financial sanctions on Russia in history, including freezing hundreds of billions of dollars in Russian foreign exchange reserves and kicking Russia out of SWIFT",
      "These moves did not bring Russia to its knees, but triggered drastic fluctuation in international energy and financial markets",
      "The dollar has been the world's dominant reserve currency",

      " In just one and a half years since the outbreak of COVID-19, the US has printed nearly half of all the dollars in circulation over its more than 200 year history, leading the world to undertake pressures caused by inflation, turbulence and bubbles that it should not have",
      "The US privatized and weaponized the public good - global financial system in the geopolitical conflicts to deal with hostile countries and substate actors",
      "This is worse than the UK, which was \"the hegemonic power\" incapable of providing international public goods between the two world wars",
      "Absurdity No",

      " The victorious nations, the US and its allies, impose their will on the rest of the world, formulating institutions and norms that serve their interests and ensure their supremacy",
      "The US and the West regard themselves as \"spokesmen of the international community\" and are accustomed to labeling some countries with discriminatory labels such as \"Evil Empire,\" \"Axis of Evil,\" \"Rogue State\" and \"Failed State\" in order to distinguish the so-called \"civilized self\" from \"the savage others",
      "\" While demonizing other countries, they regard themselves as the moral arbiter of the world; in front of the scenes it is about \"freedom and democracy,\" and behind the scenes is the ambition of unending hegemony",
      "The Russia-Ukraine conflict, which broke out under the long-term containment and high pressure of the US and NATO, has been described by some Western politicians as an \"epic\" of \"democracy versus autocracy",

      "From the \"barbarian fear\" during the massacre of American Indians to the \"Islamic fear\" during the war on terror, from the \"communist fear\" during the Cold War to the \"fear\" of \"China's challenge to rules and order\" today, all that the US wants is to profit economically and maintain its hegemony amid fears and chaos",
      "Exaggerating \"fear\" reflects the anxiety of the US as a hegemon",
      " In a strategic culture that is keen to \"find the enemy,\" the law of the jungle, the Cold War mentality, and the zero-sum game are always lingering in the minds of US politicians, and their sense of insecurity that US hegemony would be replaced and threatened is always lingering",
      "Recently, a Chinese civilian airship strayed into US airspace due to force majeure",
      " Although many US officials stated that the Chinese balloon did not pose a threat to US personnel and security, this incident was exploited",

      "\"Standing on the side of peaceful dialogue, human society must not go back to the old path of camp confrontation and division, and must not fall into the trap of zero-sum games and war conflicts",
      " This is the strong desire of the people of all countries, the common responsibility of all countries in the world, and the correct direction of the development of the times",
      "Major powers can engage in competition, but should do it in a graceful way",
      " German Chancellor Olaf Scholz once said in an article that the central question for Europeans and as the European Union is how they can remain independent actors in an increasingly multipolar world, that China's rise does not warrant isolating Beijing or curbing cooperation, and that we must also avoid the temptation to once again divide the world into blocs",
      "Facing the great changes in history, all countries in the world are facing challenges",
      " Only by adhering to the just narrative that keeps pace with history and shares the fate of the times, and acting together, can we win a bright future",

      "China is committed to promoting peace talks and would not like to see the Ukraine crisis to be protracted or escalated, said Wang, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, according to a statement on the website of the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Sunday",
      "On the Ukraine crisis, Wang stressed that China always stands on the side of peace and dialogue and is committed to promoting peace talks",
      " China would not like to see the Ukraine crisis to be protracted or escalated and Beijing is ready to work with the international community to avoid further deterioration of the situation and work tirelessly for peace",
      "Kuleba said Ukraine and China have maintained communications over the past year",
      " He said no country hopes to realize peace as soon as possible more than Ukraine",
      " Ukraine attaches importance to China's international status and important influence as well as China's position on the political settlement of the crisis",
      " Ukraine expects China to continue to play a constructive role, Kuleba said",
      "China's interaction with the top Ukraine official is part of China's efforts to push for peace talks, Zhang Hong, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times",
      "\"Their contact negates the misconception among some European countries and the US that China only has contact with the Russian side",
      " China does not choose either side between Moscow and Kiev, but stands in a position that wishes to minimize casualties,\" Zhang said",
      "China pursues a political settlement of disputes through dialogue, rather than through military options for dealing with the issue or escalating the conflict, Zhang added",
      " Just as Wang said at the MSC when answering a question concerning China's stance on the Ukraine crisis, China is not a directly involved party, did not choose to be a bystander or add fuel to the fire, still less exploit the crisis",
      "Noting that the one-year anniversary of the Ukraine crisis is days away, Wang announced that China will publish a document on its stance of finding a political settlement to the crisis",
      "China as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and major country in the international community, will not be absent from major international hot issues and will contribute its solution for the crisis as part of its efforts in global governance, Zhang noted",
      "In meeting with Kuleba, Wang also said China and Ukraine are strategic partners and the peoples of the two countries enjoy long-term friendship",
      " Wang thanks Ukraine again for assisting China with its emergency evacuation of overseas Chinese",
      "China appreciates Ukraine's adherence to the one-China principle and wishes that bilateral ties will continue to have stable development, Wang noted",

      "It is almost inevitable to see that modern warfare will stress not only ground-, sea-, air- but also space dominance, and these are all part of the hegemony the US always pursues",
      " The US is playing the trick of \"a thief crying stop thief,\" as the Pentagon was the first to deploy a missile to destroy a satellite in a test as early as 1985 and launched its space force in 2019, an event that almost marked the beginning of a new space arms race, observers noted",

      " Preventing a space arms race is an important prerequisite for ensuring peace, tranquility and sustainable use of outer space",

      "According to The Guardian, two weeks ago, the organizers of the Saturday's demonstration had published a \"Manifest for Peace\" in which they urged German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to \"stop the escalation of weapons deliveries",
      "\" It was signed by about 650,000 people, including prominent intellectuals and political figures",
      "The Russia-Ukraine conflict allowed the US to achieve its strategic goal of sowing discord between Russia and Germany",
      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a recent television interview that he does not see any prospect for peace talks at present",
      "Norbert, a former soldier, who held a banner reading: \"The real enemy sits in the City of London and New York,\" a reference he said to the financial powers who he claimed were behind the war and had no interest in it ending",
      " Germany, he said, had no right to participate in another war after World War II, The Guardian quoted him as saying",
      "According to China's national broadcaster CCTV, also on Saturday, hundreds of people demonstrated in Zurich, Switzerland, against the shipment of weapons to Ukraine, calling for an end to the implementation of sanctions against Russia",
      " Demonstrators also called on Switzerland to stop moving closer to NATO",
      "The US' manipulating its allies and desire to contain Russia have also turned off the European people, Sun Keqin, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times",
      " \"So, amid so-called great \"unity,\" the rifts within Europe are actually getting deeper,\" he added",
      "The EU approved a 10th package of sanctions against Russia on Friday",
      " The package includes tighter export restrictions regarding dual-use goods as well as measures against entities supporting Russia",
      "Relations between Europe and Russia will be harder to repair after the 10th round of economic sanctions, Gao said",
      " Once investment flows out of Russia, it is hard for Europe to bring it back",
      " The counterproductive reaction to such sanctions can be very damaging to European countries, he warned",
      "\"For European people, defeating Russia is not a realistic goal, but stopping the conflict is the most effective solution",
      " If the European and Russian economies were to \"decouple,\" as sanctions become more and more extensive, it would deal a devastating blow to the European economy,\" Sun said",

      " Photo: Screenshot from the WeChat account of the PLA South Sea FleetThe Shandong aircraft carrier group of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy recently held a series of confrontational drills in the South China Sea at a time when a US carrier strike group had entered the region, with analysts saying on Sunday that the Chinese carrier has practically enhanced its combat readiness, while the US carrier only stirred up tensions and had limited military significance",
      "Consisting of several different types of warships and dozens of warplanes, the Shandong aircraft carrier group conducted realistic combat-oriented confrontational exercises in the South China Sea, the PLA Navy said in a statement on Saturday",
      "The drills simulated hostile aircraft attacks, and J-15 fighter jets took off from the Shandong and carried out interception training, the statement said",
      "During the exercises, the carrier group also practiced cross-service multidimensional attack and defense on the surface, in the air and underwater, with new J-15 pilots becoming certified for nighttime operational capabilities, marking another big step toward forming a systematic combat capability, the PLA Navy said",
      "Photos attached to the statement showed that J-15 fighter jets crowded on the flight deck of the Shandong, an indication that the Shandong is equipped with sufficient aircraft, a Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "The Shandong carrier group carried out challenging nighttime warplane sorties and combat drills under realistic tactical settings, showing that the domestically built vessel has reached a high level of operational capability following its commissioning in December 2019, the expert said",
      "Thanks to experience gathered from the PLA Navy's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, the Shandong achieved operational capability fast with a full standard procedure, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "By training in the South China Sea, a location where the maritime environment is more complicated, the Shandong demonstrated its capabilities despite challenging situations, Song said",
      "The training in a flotilla also showed the Shandong has integrated with other vessels, Song said",
      " \"The Liaoning recently conducted drills in the West Pacific, and now the Shandong is practicing in the South China Sea",
      " In the future, the two carriers might form a dual carrier group and train together,\" he said",
      "On Thursday, the US Navy announced that its Nimitz carrier strike group began operating in the South China Sea, with two Chinese ships tailing, CNN reported on the day",
      "Attempting to threaten China, the US aircraft carrier's activities in the South China Sea actually have limited military significance and will only stir up tension in the region, experts said",
      "A recent war game scenario run by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies indicated that the US would lose its aircraft carriers should they interfere in a possible conflict in the Taiwan Straits",
      "It is normal that the PLA monitors potentially provocative foreign military moves on China's doorstep, and the foreign forces would serve as practice partners that contribute to the PLA's combat readiness, analysts said",

      " Photo:XinhuaChina urges an objective, impartial and professional investigation into the explosion of the Nord Stream pipeline, which has been called the energy lifeline of Europe, Wang Wenbing, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said at a press conference on Monday",
      " Wang said that the explosion had a significant negative impact on the global energy market and the global ecological environment, and had even sent Europe into a winter energy crisis",
      " Given the harm of damaging major transnational infrastructure and the serious consequences, the international community has the right to demand a thorough investigation",
      " On September 26, 2022, two Russian underwater pipelines carrying natural gas to Europe, the Nord Stream I and II, exploded on the same day under the Baltic Sea, causing large amounts of gas to leak into the nearby sea",
      " After the explosion, the US, the EU, NATO and Russia all said the blast was caused by sabotage",
      " Moreover, Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated that the Nord Stream gas pipeline had suffered an unprecedented international terrorist attack in a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan",
      " A shocking report by US investigative journalist Seymour Hersh was released on February 8, accusing the US of being the culprit behind the blasts, once again igniting international public debate",
      " John Dougan, another American journalist who provided evidence of American involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Streams in the Baltic Sea, told Russian media outlet Sputnik that he received an anonymous letter from a participant in NATO's BALTOPS 22 exercises, during which explosives were allegedly planted on Russian gas pipelines",
      " \"This was not an easy operation to carry out",
      " It's the kind of operation that the CIA and other covert parts of the US government do carry out rather routinely, and the US was basically the only country with the motive, the means,\" said Jeffery Sachs,a world-renowned economist, professor of Public Policy at Columbia University and former Special Advisor to the UN Secretary General",
      " What is puzzling is the US government, media, and European partners' collective silence",
      " All these unusual actions reinforce the belief that the Nord Stream bombing was extremely complicated, Wang noted",

      " Photo: TVB Hong Kong via APFour former family members of Hong Kong socialite and model Abby Choi Tin-fung, whose skull was found in a soup pot in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), were remanded in custody without bail after appearing before the court on Monday on charges of murder and perverting the course of justice, local media reported, adding that the case was adjourned for judgment until May 8",
      "Police charged Choi's ex-husband Alex Kwong Kong-chi, his father Kwong Kau and elder brother Anthony Kwong Kong-ki, with one count of murder, while his mother Jenny Li Sui-heung, had been provisionally charged with perverting the course of justice",
      "The skull of the deceased was found in a soup pot on Sunday evening, police said, noting that there was a hole in the skull of the right back ear with a diameter of about six centimeters",
      " It could not be ruled out that Choi was fatally injured by a blunt object on her way to Tai Po on the same day, the police added",
      "The body of the 28-year-old model and socialite, who had been missing for several days, was found in a village in Tai Po on February 24 and shocked the whole city",
      " Initial investigations found that the victim was involved in a major dispute over money with her ex-husband's family and that some were unhappy with the way they handled the property",
      "Local media earlier reported that preliminary findings suggested that the husband's father Kwong Kau, a former Hong Kong police officer who left the force more than a decade ago, was the mastermind",
      "Choi's body was found dismembered by police on Monday with her left and right leg stumps in a freezer, moreover, a soup pot in the house was found mixed with human tissue",
      " Choi went missing after entering a car driven by her ex-husband's brother on the night of February 21",
      "The victim, who married Kwong Kong-chi when she was 18, gave birth to two daughters before their marriage broke up",
      " However, Choi still took care of her ex-husband's family, including buying a house for them and employing her ex-husband's brother as a chauffeur",
      "Police said on Monday that the suspects have been uncooperative and that they will try to find enough evidence to bring the perpetrators to justice",
      "In addition, Hong Kong media reported that the mistress of Kwong Kong-chi's father Kwong Kau was also arrested on Sunday night on suspicion of helping Kwong rent a house and helping him hide",
      " The police detained her overnight and will further investigate whether she knew about the murder plan in advance",
      "Choi's currentpartner Chris Tam has been in a state of extreme distress and pain since the tragedy, according to media reports",
      " Despite Abby Choi having four children, two with Chris and two with her ex-husband, Alex Kwong Kong-chi, Chris has promised to take care of all of his late wife's children",

      " Photo: VCGThe US and Japan are continuing to undermine regional peace and stability in 2023, as top defense and diplomatic officials from both countries vowed to strengthen their military alliance and security cooperation, citing the \"greatest strategic challenge\" from China",
      " Chinese experts said that a closer military alliance with the US, while adopting a more aggressive posture, would mean a more dangerous position for Japan, and the provocative military alliance would not be welcomed by regional countries",
      "The military updating plan was announced on Wednesday (US time) after a day of \"2+2\" security talks between Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi and Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada and their US counterparts Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin in Washington",
      " Also citing \"threats\" from Russia and North Korea, US and Japan officials agreed to reorganize the Okinawa-based 12th Artillery Regiment in Japan into the 12th Marine Littoral Regiment by 2025, with advanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities as well as anti-ship and transportation capabilities, according to a statement from US Department of Defense",
      "The two sides agreed to promote joint research and development of cutting-edge defense equipment",
      " Furthermore, Japan will work with US officials on the command-and-control arrangements with an emphasis on interoperability with US forces",
      "The two militaries will also expand joint/shared use of facilities in Japan and increase the number of exercises, which will include exercises in Japan's southwestern islands",
      "According to Kyodo, Austin played down the Taiwan question while Hayashi stressed that Japan's basic position on the Taiwan question remains unchanged",
      " However, analysts believed that the aim and target of a saga of deployment in southwestern Japan islands, which is close to China's Taiwan region, is obvious",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a press briefing Thursday that regarding military cooperation, the US and Japan should ensure that it does not harm the interests of any third party or regional peace and stability",
      "Analysts said Japan is not only breaking away from its defense-only principle and preparing to interfere in the Taiwan question, but also make itself available to the US military as a forward operating base, allowing the US to launch military operations against China from Japanese soil",
      "The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been preparing for worst-case scenarios in the Taiwan Straits, and from the very start, it has been expecting US-Japan joint forces as well as some other Western forces to interfere in the Taiwan question, they said",
      "All military installations in the first island chain close to the island of Taiwan, including US naval and air bases in Japan, can be obliterated by the precision weapons of the PLA Navy, Air Force and Rocket Force, Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times",

      "If Japan continues, together with the US and the Taiwan secessionists, to provoke China, the PLA is sure to take countermeasures, including holding more exercises and patrols in the international waters and airspace around Japan, enhancing PLA's combat capabilities in the far sea, Fu said",
      "Strange bedfellowsThe 2+2 meeting came weeks after Japan revised its three key defense documents in December 2022, putting Tokyo on a path of acquiring a long-range strike capability to hit enemy bases and strengthening Self-Defense Forces units in its southwestern islands",
      "Experts believed that the revised security document represents a major shift in Japan's national security strategy, which made the 2023 US-Japan 2+2 meeting different from previous ones that were held when Japan's post-World War II principles of exclusive self-defense were not entirely subverted",
      "During the meeting, both Austin and Blinken expressed support for the decisions manifested in Japan's new national defense strategy and their decision to increase defense spending and to develop counterstrike capability, read the US statement",
      "Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday that the latest efforts by Japan and US, including emphasizing long-range striking ability, upgrading the Marine unit near Taiwan island, and jointly developing defense equipment, marks a strategic shift in Japan-US security cooperation from being defensive to being active and offensive",
      "It also means that the US is showing an attitude of encouragement regarding gradually lifting Japan's taboo on collective self-defense or some other move that breaks through Article 9 of its Constitution that renounces war, Da said",
      "\"Japan may develop its own intermediate-range missiles, and it can't rule out the US deploying intermediate-range missiles in Japan in the future,\" he added",
      "The officials discussed the temporary deployment of an American MQ-9 Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle unit to Kanoya Air Base in southern Japan to increase presence over the East China Sea, according to the US Department of Defense",
      "Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times that the US-Japan alliance has shifted from an emphasis on the protection of Japan to one that stresses Tokyo's cooperation in achieving US strategic planning",
      "Japan and the US are clearly eyeing practical military preparations, but the US will undoubtedly ask Japan to do more in the future to share the responsibility and costs of a possible conflict, Li said",
      "\"The ostensibly closer US-Japan alliance actually puts Japan in a riskier and more sacrificial position,\" he added",
      "On the other hand, experts noted that although the US is trying to strengthen its control over Japan in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan is also expertly inducing the US to serve its own strategic needs",
      "Japan hopes to benefit from the China-US competition",
      " If there is a dispute between China and Japan in the East China Sea or over the Taiwan question, Japan will not hesitate to ask the US to participate and \"do something\" to serve its own needs, said Li",

      "Destroyers of stabilityThe 2+2 security talks paved the way for the Friday summit between US President Joe Biden and Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on security and economic issues",
      " Media reported that the leaders' meeting will highlight enhancing military ties as well as a Japan's intensification of chip restrictions against China",
      "It also came after Kishida's meeting with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, during which an agreement was signed that allows deployment of British and Japanese troops on each others' territory for training and other operations",

      " File Photo: VCGThe head of Taiwan island's executive body Su Tseng-chang announced on Thursday that his team will resign en masse, and his resignation is pending approval from the regional leader Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan-based media outlets have reported",
      "Cross-Straits observers say they believe the resignation of the diehard secessionist who has poisoned cross-Straits relations, along with his decreasing popularity, highlights the fiasco of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s strategy of \"resisting the Chinese mainland and protecting Taiwan",
      "\" With Su's resignation and Tsai's earlier resignation as head of the DPP, the secessionist party's internal divisions are expected to intensify",
      "Su made the announcement after the region's \"legislature\" approved the general budget for fiscal 2023 and closed for winter recess on Thursday",
      " Following the approval of the budget, he met with Tsai and again tendered his resignation after an earlier offer to resign was turned down",
      "Su is a diehard Taiwan secessionist who was put on a sanctions list by the Chinese mainland in November 2021, according to the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council",
      "After the DPP was defeated in the 2022 local \"elections\" in Taiwan, there were growing calls on the island for a reshuffle of the administrative affairs agency",
      " Su's resignation has triggered a power struggle within the DPP and affected the party's positioning for the regional \"election\" in 2024, local media reported",
      "Lo Ping-cheng, spokesperson for the regional \"executive body,\" said in a separate statement that Su and his team will formally step down once Tsai has confirmed their replacements",
      "Zhang Wensheng, deputy dean of the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Friday that during his term of office, Su failed to adequately deal with the economic and livelihood issues of the island, as well as cross-Straits relations",
      "While it was Tsai who resigned as the party's leader after the DPP was trounced in local \"elections\" in November 2022, many experts say it was Su's poor governance that triggered the public discontent that led to the party's defeat, Zhang said",
      "Su's cross-Straits policy, coupled with his stubborn stance of \"Taiwan independent\" secessionism, was extremely unfriendly, Wang Yu-ching, a Taiwan cross-Straits observer who lives in the Chinese mainland, told the Global Times on Friday",
      "After the outbreak of the pandemic, Su has deliberately used the term \"Wuhan pneumonia\" when describing COVID-19, and banned the export of masks from Taiwan island to the Chinese mainland",
      " Besides this, he had set various restrictions preventing mainland students from returning to school in Taiwan and mainland family members from reuniting in Taiwan",
      " He once said that in case of war, he would fight the People's Liberation Army to the end even if it was only with a broom in hand",
      "\"Deteriorating cross-Straits relations led to the unemployment of many Taiwan people",
      "They could no longerstand Su's incompetence and arrogance,\" Wang added",
      " Taiwan Photo: UnsplashA recent poll on the island, released on Friday after Su's resignation, shows that 85",
      "2 percent of the public believe that Su should resign, and 84",
      "1 percent were dissatisfied with his work",
      "Meanwhile, analysts noted that the power void after Su's resignation will lead to more bitter infighting among the different DPP factions",
      "The ousting of Su's faction means an opportunity for DPP members from other factions to make political gains, Wang said",
      "Echoing Wang, Zhang said that he believes that regarding Lai Ching-te, the vice leader of the Taiwan region since 2022 and the incumbent DPP chairman, Tsai's camp will seek to balance him by appointing a new head of the executive body",
      "In contrast to Su's hard-nosed stance, Chen Chien-jen, Tsai's confidant and the former vice leader of the Taiwan region who's in a pole position for succeeding Su, has always taken a more low-key and pragmatic stance on cross-Strait relations",
      "\"This may also be an adjustment by Tsai's camp to cater to changing public opinion on the island: peace rather than war",
      " And Taiwan secession means war,\" Zhang said",
      "\"However, Lai, the DPP's most popular candidate in 2024 Taiwan's regional leader 'election,' represents an extreme pro-secession stance",

      "\"Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force spotted a PLA Navy flotilla consisting of the Type 055 large destroyer Lhasa, the Type 052D destroyer Kaifeng and the Type 903A replenishment ship Taihu sailing from the East China Sea through the Osumi Strait into the West Pacific from Tuesday to Wednesday and a PLA Navy electronic reconnaissance vessel with hull number 796 sailing from the East China Sea through the Miyako Strait into the West Pacific from Monday to Wednesday, Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff said in two press releases on Wednesday",
      "This is the second time the Lhasa has made a voyage into distant waters this year, with the first one in June, when it led a flotilla of a similar configuration into the Sea of Japan, and then sailed in a circle around Japan before returning, according to releases by Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff at the time",
      "The latest voyage is likely a regular far sea training exercise carried out according to training schedules, which is aimed at enhancing the Lhasa and other vessels' operational capabilities in far sea, a Beijing-based military expert told the Global Times on Thursday, requesting anonymity",

      "\"Japan is also planning to purchase Tomahawk cruise missiles from the US, which experts believe are of a type of aggressive, standoff weapon that can be used in first attacks, going against Japan's pacifist constitution set after Japan's defeat in World War II",
      "It also came after a senior official of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party recently also visited the island of Taiwan and made irresponsible remarks on China",
      "While the PLA warships' far sea training is routine and not aimed at any third party, it will display the PLA's capabilities in safeguarding China's national sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests, as well as defending the post-World War II international order, the expert said",

      "Cross-border travel between the HKSAR and the Chinese mainland fully resumed as of February 6, which was hailed as a significant move in boosting Hong Kong's post-pandemic recovery and accelerating the city's integration into the Greater Bay Area plan, especially after the unprecedented social turmoil in 2019 and three-year pandemic since the early 2020 have slowed down this plan, observers said",

      "The survey also finds that 26 percent of the participants believe that European countries are \"not wise\" to follow the US to sanction Russia due to the Ukraine crisis, while 23 percent said European countries are being forced to get involved, and 24 percent said the sanction is \"wise",
      "\"In countries like Greece, Hungary, Serbia, Italy and Turkey, the people who dislike the US role in the crisis are obviously more than the ones who are pro-US, and analysts said some of these countries are EU members, and Serbia is applying for the EU membership, while Turkey is a NATO member, so they will to some extent play special roles in the trilateral relations of the EU, the US and Russia",
      "Zhang Chao, an expert from the Institute of European Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday that the Russia-Ukraine conflict provides new incentives for the development of the Europe-US ties, and the survey reflects that although most Europeans are not satisfied with US' role in Europe, the current situation has forced them to stand closer with the US, and the survey also shows that most Europeans have sensed the damages caused by the anti-Russia sanction",
      "The survey results reflects the European public's judgement based on the current actual situation, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "\"Since they feel the threat is right in front of them and they have a strong sense of crisis, they cannot be expected to think about the future in an absolute sensible way or independently deal with the crisis in an emergency status,\" Cui explained",
      "As for to what extent can the current public opinion affect the future relations among Europe, the US and Russia, Cui said the impact will depend on how the conflict will come to an end and on how the US and NATO will use the current public opinion and situation",
      "Cui said it's very challenging to predict the future development of relations among the EU, the US and Russia, which can be affected by the situation on the battle field, the diplomatic fallout, as well as the exchanges of interests",
      " \"For example, if we had a cease-fire at first, the public might tend to solve the issue in a diplomatic way rather than focusing on the security problem",
      " Thus, they could be less reliable on the US and NATO",

      " Lee CampEditor's Note:The Russia-Ukraine conflict is approaching its one-year mark, with no end in sight",
      " It is eating up scarce European resources, preventing millions of refugees from returning home and weakening the global economic outlook while the US and some European countries are fanning the flames of the war, keeping sending weapons to Ukraine",
      " How will the Russia-Ukraine conflict end? What are the biggest stumbling blocks for negotiation and diplomatic resolution?In an interview with Global Times (GT) reporter Wang Wenwen, Lee Camp (Camp), a US comedian and former host of RT America which was shut down not long after the conflict started, said that the idea that people have been manipulated to believe that the only way to peace is war is horrifying",
      " \"Our mainstream media acts as a conduit for pro-war talking points, because the US really is a war machine,\" he said",
      " He also accused US politicians of not caring what's going on on the ground in Ukraine, which is \"a form of sociopathy",
      "\"This is the fourth installment of the series",
      "GT: When reporting on the Russia-Ukraine war, US mainstream media outlets are propagating their own selective facts and myths, while censoring counterclaims, like what they did to RT",
      " Why do US mainstream media outlets behave like conduits for pro-war propaganda?Camp: There are a few reasons",
      " There's a famous quote that one of the first casualties of war is the truth",
      " I think we definitely saw that, although I think the truth maybe was pronounced dead before the war began",
      "But the US corporate media is really an extension of the state corporations that now own our government",
      " They own our politicians",
      " A large Princeton study found that nothing goes through our Congress that doesn't confirm or work with everything corporate America once was",
      " And these mainstream media is all large corporate entities that are all intertwined with large corporate America",
      " So anything said on our mainstream media must work with whatever corporate America wants",
      " And what corporate America wants is, in this case, war, a proxy war in Ukraine between the US and Russia",
      "I'm opposed to the Russian invasion",
      " But I'm also opposed to the 2014 US-backed coup in Ukraine",
      " I'm opposed to the growth of NATO further onto Russia's borders",
      " You can be opposed to all those things at once",
      " It's called being anti-war",
      " And true anti-war voices are not allowed on our mainstream media in the US",
      "As you said, our mainstream media acts as a conduit for pro-war talking points, because the US really is a war machine",
      " We spend a trillion dollars, roughly, if you include the black budget on our military every year",
      " That's more than 144 countries combined",
      " 144 countries' military spending around the world does not combine to the amount the US spends in one year",
      " It's truly an unbelievable amount of money with 800 to 900 military bases around the world",
      "Our economy is wrapped up in war",
      " Our media is wrapped up in war",
      " Our politicians are wrapped up in war",
      " There really is not a minute that goes by that the US is not involved in war, either economic or otherwise, but often actually hot war, meaning missiles and bombs",
      "GT: One year on, how does the US corporate media's way of reporting affect the American people's perception of the war?Camp: I think it's quite clear that if you say something enough, the American people believe it, and that goes for pretty much people around the world",
      " A large psychological study found that people confuse familiarity with proof, meaning if they hear something a lot, they will think it's true, even if they knew it wasn't true in the beginning",
      "That is how American media works",
      " It repeats the same thing over and over again until people start to believe it",
      " And this is despite the fact or even in light of the fact that the mainstream media has been shown to have told great egregious lies over the course of our history, including WMD in Iraq -- the list goes on and on -- smaller ones more recently, the Taliban bounty stories in Afghanistan, Cuba is using acoustic weapons to give US diplomats light headaches, just really dumb garbage",
      " And our mainstream media is proven to have lied about these things",
      " Even when those revelations come out, they still continue to do their job as if it didn't happen, as if those lies weren't revealed",
      "We should be at a point where no one should believe any of the mainstream media in America",
      " But unfortunately, they continue to operate and obviously they have the money behind them",
      " They have billions and billions of dollars that go into this every year",
      "GT: In one of your tweets, you said that the ruling elites don't care at all whether the sanctions and the proxy war in Ukraine have boomeranged and harmed average Americans",
      " What harm do the sanctions and proxy war in Ukraine bring to the Americans?Camp: There's kind of a larger harm in that",
      " It harms cooperation around the world",
      " It harms Americans' views of other countries",
      " The truth is that Americans should be working with Russians and Chinese and should be working with people around the world to solve all of the grave issues that humanity is facing right now",
      " We've got environmental catastrophe, we've got climate crisis, we've got being on the brink of nuclear war",
      " There's a long list of catastrophic scenarios that the people around the globe should be coming together to solve",
      "But instead, when you create a proxy war, when you create propaganda that says everyone in that country is evil, it means that people can't work together and they can't actually view the reality of the situation",
      " They have to simply just have blinders on and go",
      " Those people are evil, they are bad end of story",
      " So that way it harms Americans",
      "But then there's kind of the more nitty-gritty on the ground stuff, which is that there's a lot of economic hardship in America and Europe",
      " Some of it, not all of it, is due to this new economic war that is splitting the globe in half",
      " The US has put massive sanctions on Russia",
      " Those sanctions are harming the energy supplies of most of Europe",
      " It's causing inflation in America",
      " These things all have ripple effects because the global economy is intertwined",
      " When you shut off major countries and say we're going to stop you from ever being able to sell your products or to work with us, it obviously ripples around the world",
      "GT: Why they don't care? What flaws do the sanctions and the proxy war expose about the US system?Camp: The ruling class in America doesn't care that the average Americans are struggling, that people can't pay their bills and that there's a level of debt we've never seen before in America",
      " They don't care because they are insanely rich",
      " The amount of money that they have is unbelievable",

      " These things don't impact them",
      " The price of gas doesn't really impact them",
      " The price of groceries doesn't impact them",
      " They don't care about that",
      " In their view, it is a long game to make sure that the US maintains hegemony and our global control",
      " And that's really what they're playing",
      "There's a lot of flaws there",
      " One of the main ones is it shows how short-term greedy these people are",
      " There's short-term greed and there's long-term greed",
      " Long-term greed could be something like you wanna have a sustainable planet because you want to be able to live and keep having your business if you're a business person",
      "But short-term greed is we're going to destroy everything we can in order to maintain our control and economic hegemony, hegemony writ large",
      " They don't seem to care that, but in the long term, you have massive trouble for people",
      " You have massive debt, you have massive other dysfunction that results from creating a proxy war",
      " They don't care what's going on actually on the ground in Ukraine",
      " They don't actually care if Ukrainians die",
      " The expression that many people have been using is the US wants to fight Russia to the last Ukrainian",
      " We are willing to have a proxy war with Russia, even if every Ukrainian dies",
      " It doesn't matter to the US ruling elite",
      " And it's a form of sociopathy",
      " It's a sociopathic view of the world to not care about those human beings on the ground",
      "GT: Will the conflict prompt more anti-imperialist and anti-war voices like you?Camp: There has been a growth in people that are to some degree anti-imperialist",
      " Especially in the Global South, I think a lot of humanity around the globe is realizing that the way the US does business, which is basically \"listen to us or we will destroy you,\" \"do whatever we say or we will destroy you",
      "\" Most people are waking up to the fact that that is unacceptable and unsustainable",
      "So you are seeing a lot of people waking up",
      " Some are in America, but many are in Africa and Latin America, people are standing up against this imperialism and colonialism",
      " In Latin America, people are voting for governments that are speaking out against US imperialism",
      " In Africa, you're seeing some of that as well",
      "I think there's a lot of waking up around the world",
      " One example is that apparently 80 percent of the world's population live in countries that are not supporting the US proxy war in Ukraine, if taking the nations that did not sign on to US sanctions and calculating populations of those countries",
      " That doesn't mean they're all throwing their support behind Russia, but they're basically saying we're staying out of it",
      "Just a few years ago, the US could pressure a lot of countries around this globe to cave in and say they support whatever the US was standing for, whatever foreign policy we were standing for",
      " But now you have 80 percent of the world's population against the largest foreign policy initiative of the US this year and last year",
      " That's a big deal",
      " That's a lot of the globe population standing up and not willing to just bow down to US hegemony",
      "GT: Will cognitive warfare become a new normal in future wars?Camp: In many ways, our US military has been military complex and has been busy with trying to influence minds for many years",
      " Propaganda is nothing new",
      " Propaganda was very prevalent in World War II, and the Nazis were quite good at it",
      " So propaganda is not that new, but in terms of really thinking you can dominate people's minds 100 percent, there's more discussion and thought about that in our military industrial complex than there used to be",
      "I just recently covered on my show, the most censored news",
      " I covered the NATO panel and NATO report, saying that they viewed cognitive warfare as what may soon become the next domain of war",
      " It's beyond just propaganda, it is a full on social engineering of people so that they will support whatever foreign policy they're told and things like endless war",
      "And in many ways, they already succeed about that",
      " There are a large percentage of Americans that think the only way to create peace in Ukraine is to send missiles, bombs and tanks",
      "The idea that people have been manipulated to believe that the only way to peace is war is horrifying",
      " That is a sad state of reality",
      " Because if we're going to achieve peace, if we're gonna have peace in this world ever again, it can't be done with missiles",
      " It has to be done with talking",
      " It has to be done with diplomacy",
      " It has to be done with human beings sitting down and working out our differences",
      " And the US views that as the last resort",
      " The US now has a policy where if anyone sits down to speak to anyone, then that means they've been manipulated or they have given in or they have failed, whereas talking and sorting out our differences diplomatically should be step one",
      " It should be an evolved way of being",
      " It should be a cooperative way of being, and that is the way you achieve peace",
      "GT: In a recent interview you did with co-founder of Code Pink, you discussed how to make politicians very uncomfortable",
      " So how? Do you think what you and your peers do will make US politicians uncomfortable?Camp: Our politicians insulate themselves, they try and not to interact with average Americans that often",
      " But they will have events and things and anti-war organizations like Code Pink will often show up and get in the face of these politicians and accuse them of the things they are actually guilty of",
      " Say, why do you support these economic sanctions when people are dying? Why do you support putting more money into the Pentagon when we are bombing so many people? Things like that",
      " And the politicians get very uncomfortable because they don't actually have answers to these questions",
      " They're not used to someone actually being in their space and asking them these questions",
      "I think it's important for them to see that there are real Americans that care about these issues",
      " But it's also important because people are far more likely to talk about something like that than they are to talk about an online petition or something like that",
      " So it's a form of activism that I think is very important",
      " Americans should step up to our politicians and our media and ask them these questions",
      "GT: Do you worry about possible suppression against you?Camp: The suppression continues",
      " It continues every day",
      " My TV show was cancelled, and the same week, my YouTube page, which was one of my biggest platforms, was banned around the world and over 2,000 videos banned around the world, which is basically the digital equivalent of book burning",
      " So they have burned all of my old episodes of Redacted Tonight",
      "Now I have a new YouTube page",
      " I have a Rumble page and a Facebook page",
      " Most of what I deal with now is just shadow banning and suppression",
      " In the US our social media far more rarely delete something",
      " I know there are many countries in the world where they do delete political content, but what ours normally does in the US is that you think you've put it out there and just no one sees it",
      " I have a large Facebook page, but very few people see my post",
      " So it becomes very similar to deleting",
      " It just doesn't have a big banner that says this has been deleted",
      "There's a lot of suppression",
      " Unlike many countries, the US claims to have freedom of speech",
      " We claim you can say whatever you want, and that is your freedom",
      " But it's not actually true",
      " You really have to say what is a kind of a certain allowable mix",
      " And if you don't, then they will cover up what's being said",
      " Now luckily, I live in a country where I don't have to fear being arrested for saying these things",
      " But we don't have the freedom of speech that we claim to have",

      "Ambassador Fu Cong, head of the Chinese Mission to the EU, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview that he is optimistic about the recovery of China-EU relations",
      " Although there are still some problems facing China-EU relations, China does not fully agree with some of the EU's position on the Ukraine issue, but it does not want the issue to affect the development of China-EU relations",
      "At the invitation of the governments of France, Italy, Hungary and Russia, Wang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, visited France, Italy, Hungary and Russia from February 14 to 22",
      "Wang also attended the 59th Munich Security Conference and delivered a speech at its China session to communicate the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security",
      " The visit was on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and attracted huge attention from the global community",
      "\"The nine-day visit is aimed at sending a signal of peace",
      " Visiting both Europe and Russia is also conveying the message about China promoting peace talks,\" Fu said, noting that China is very concerned about the escalating situation",
      "The visit also aims to release another important message that China-EU relations should not be affected by the Ukraine issue, Fu said",
      " Europe's misplaced emotion toward China on the Ukraine issue is irrational, as China has independent foreign policy and cannot fully agree with some of the EU's positions on the Ukraine issue, the Chinese diplomat said",
      " \"But China does not want the Ukraine issue to affect the development of China-EU relations",
      "\"Fu suggested that the EU should avoid being too emotional in dealing with the Ukraine issue",
      " \"People can have wishes, but they must face reality",
      " Otherwise, this war will be protracted",
      "\"Despite some problems, Fu said he is \"very optimistic\" about the recovery of China-EU relations",
      " The general trend of China-EU ties developing in a positive direction is very obvious, Fu said",
      "In the first half of 2023, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel are expected to visit China, and the two sides have started relevant preparations",

      " French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni are also expected to visit China in the first half of 2023, according to media reports",
      "Some observers said the willingness of many European leaders to visit China has sent a positive signal to the world, and it also allows people to see the possibility of China-EU relations getting out of the stagnation of the past two years",
      " However, the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) is still frozen today due to sanctions",
      " Also, the stance of some politicians including those from Lithuania on the Taiwan question has cast a shadow over China-EU relations",
      "When it comes to relaunching the CAI, the two sides should \"look forward and let the bygones be bygones,\" Fu said",
      " China had previously proposed to the EU that both sides could lift sanctions simultaniously so that the agreement can be restarted, but responses from the EU on this proposal were mixed, with some in favor and some believed it's premature, he said",
      "If the EU thinks that China's proposal may not fly, I hope they can propose a solution that they think can solve the problem, Fu noted",
      " \"We are open to that, and as long as the solution is based on mutual benefit and equality, China is willing to actively consider it,\" he said,In the context of the global economic downturn, restarting the CAI as soon as possible will have a good effect on both sides and the global economy, the Chinese envoy said",
      "The main difficulty in unfreezing the CAI lies in the differences between the two sides on human rights issues",
      " In this regard, Fu believes that China and the EU have restarted the human rights dialogue, and the doubts and concerns of the EU on human rights can be discussed through specific channels, which do not have to be linked to economic and trade issues",
      "China is willing to clarify the EU's prejudice and misunderstanding of China's human rights issues, reduce their differences, and promote the restart of the CAI, Fu said",
      "On the Taiwan question, the Chinese diplomat emphasized that the EU's position must be acceptable to the Chinese side",
      "The EU should not have a so-called \"EU's one-China policy,\" and it has no right to unilaterally interpret the one-China principle, Fu said",
      "\"Some people in the EU always talk about 'EU's one-China policy",
      "' It's like their policy has nothing to do with our one-China principle or as if they have the monopoly to interpret their policy,\" Fu said",

      " Wang said China appreciates Russia's reiteration of its willingness to resolve the issue through dialogue, noting that China will, as always, uphold an objective and fair position in the political settlement of the crisis",
      "Putin warmly welcomed Wang with open arms",
      " Wang said that the current international situation is complex and grave, but China-Russia relations have stood the test of the international situation and are mature, resilient and stable",
      " The China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination has never been targeted at, interfered with or coerced by a third party, Wang stressed",
      "This is because China-Russia relations enjoy a solid political, economic and cultural foundation and are calm and sober after summing up the historical experience, he noted",
      "More importantly, the pursuit of a multi-polar world and greater democracy in international relations that the two countries jointly support is in line with the trend of the times and the aspiration of the majority of countries, Wang noted",
      "Putin said the 20th CPC National Congress opens up new prospects for China's development, noting that at present, Russia-China relations are moving toward set goals",
      " Bilateral cooperation in various fields and coordination in multilateral organizations such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS are fruitful",
      "Strengthening solidarity and coordination in international affairs is of great significance to promoting democracy in international relations and balance and stability in the international landscape, Putin said",

      " Illustration: Liu Rui/Global TimesIs \"win-win\" or \"zero-sum\" the main global philosophy of international relations?Westerners would say that \"zero-sum\" is the way the world works",
      " This is the philosophy of \"I win, you lose\" - or \"win-lose\" - and it has a deep root in Western history",
      " Think of the doctrine of election or the \"chosen people\": one group is chosen by God and the rest can go to hell",
      " Through 500 years of Western imperialism and colonialism, this is how the West has treated the rest of the world",
      "My sense is that the West is in the minority on this question",
      " Western countries comprise only a small portion of the world's population, and so their \"win-lose\" philosophy is also in the minority",
      " This brings us to \"win-win,\" which is a core principle of China's foreign policy",
      " As we know, \"win-win\" arises from China's long cultural tradition",
      "So we have two philosophies competing - paradoxically - on the world stage",
      " Thus far, it seems to be China vs the West, but we need to ask: do other countries have versions of \"win-win\"? And how do they deal with the West's \"win-lose\" approach?They are many possible examples, but let us focus on Papua New Guinea (PNG), since it is increasingly important in Pacific and Southeast Asian relations",
      " PNG's foreign policy follows the principle of \"friends to all and enemies to none",
      "\" PNG is not alone: the Solomon Islands has the same policy, as do other Pacific countries",
      "However, PNG often finds that it is caught between both approaches: it has more in common with China, but it also must deal with the West",
      " To see how, let us consider PNG-China relations and PNG-Australia relations",
      "In November 2018, Chinese President Xi Jinping made an official visit to PNG ahead of the APEC leader's forum",
      " Earlier in 2018, PNG's prime minister had signed onto the Belt and Road Initiative, and President Xi's visit to PNG marked a significant enhancement of China-PNG relations",
      " As the \"Post-Courier\" newspaper noted, PNG had achieved a \"win-win\" outcome with the visit",
      " The paper stressed Xi's \"wise parting message,\" who said that we should not expect one development model to fit all developing countries, since the latter should have more say on their development path of choice",
      "In June 2022, then Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited PNG",
      " Again, many agreements were signed and China's economic partnership with PNG was producing results all the way from the state electricity grid to medical facilities",
      " When welcoming Wang Yi, Prime Minister James Marape stressed PNG's \"friends to all and enemies to none\" foreign policy",
      " Marape also said that the China-PNG relationship is \"as solid and strong as ever,\" and that it \"cannot be compromised or sabotaged",
      "\"By contrast, PNG-Australia relations are very different",
      " For 60 years (1914-1975), PNG was a colony of Australia, and for the 48 years since independence PNG has been treated very poorly",
      " Reading through the PNG newspaper articles, one comes across a long list of grievances: a lack of recognition of the assistance from PNG soldiers and villagers to Australian troops during the struggle against Japan; \"boomerang aid,\" or \"aid\" that benefits Australia and not PNG; the Australian bans on PNG agricultural products and on issuing visas to PNG citizens; and so on",
      "Clearly, \"friends to all and enemies to none\" is much more of a challenge for PNG in relation to Australia, since many in PNG struggle to see Australia as a \"friend",
      "\"It was therefore not easy for the Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, to visit PNG in January 2023",
      " Many were the grievances to be addressed and the discussions were difficult",
      " At the joint press conference after the meetings, there was much \"feel-good\" talk about \"friendship",
      "\" Yet, commentators noted that Australia emphasised a postponed \"security\" agreement, while PNG stressed economic development",
      " A PNG newspaper observed, \"Our most immediate need is to fix our economy, feed ourselves, and live quiet secure lives",
      "\"However, the Australian media tried to frame Albanese's visit in terms of \"zero-sum",
      "\" At the press conference, Marape was asked: what does the security agreement mean for PNG-China relations? Marape answered that these issues \"were not before us",
      "\" The PNG-China relationship remains the PNG-China relationship, he said",
      " As for Australia, the relation is \"particularly unique,\" so there was no need to bring \"China or any other nation into the picture",
      "\" In other words, we will deal with each country in our own way",
      "The hapless Australian media (and not a few of the ruling elite) were puzzled, since this answer did not suit their \"win-lose\" worldview - no matter how hard they tried to make it fit",
      "To return to my initial question: it seems that versions of \"win-win\" are more common in the world than \"win-lose",
      "\" We would need to consider more examples beyond PNG and the Pacific to confirm this conclusion, but the Pacific is a good start",
      "So what should be done about Western countries like Australia and their \"zero-sum\" philosophy? Given the deep cultural roots, it will take many lessons to unlearn this destructive philosophy",
      " But perhaps they could begin with more time in PNG, and other Pacific countries, so as to learn more about \"friends to all and enemies to none,\" and \"win-win",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/GTWang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, is paying a visit to Russia on Monday and Tuesday",
      " Since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, both US media and politicians have increased their efforts in pushing sets of narrative against China-Russia relations",
      "One is to try and drive a wedge between the two countries, portraying their bilateral relations as \"expedient",
      "\" The other is to hype the so-called \"China-Russia axis\" and call for a confrontation between the West and China and Russia, which seems to be more evidently days before Wang's visit",
      "\"Hyping a so-called 'China-Russia alliance' and its confrontation with the Western camp in a sensational way, Washington is more aimed at its domestic audience and allies",
      " The perceived threat of China and Russia is an inevitable excuse for Washington to increase military and defense spending",
      " And it can also encourage European allies to move closer to the US,\" Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times",
      "Noticeably, these two sets of rhetoric serve the same goal - that is to beef up the US' suppression of China and Russia",
      "The reasons why the US is concerned about China-Russia cooperation are multifaceted",
      " At present, the most direct one is: The US worries that its plan to defeat Russia by using Ukraine as a proxy through large-scale assistance in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict will fail",
      "As a matter of fact, the US' anxiety about China-Russia cooperation existed long before the Ukraine crisis",
      " According to Cui, the US is fearful that if China and Russia join hands with more partners, such as those within Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS, and establish a fairer world system, it will accelerate the collapse of the US-centered mechanism",
      " This is the key why the US and the West are most worried about a close relationship between China and Russia",
      "Furthermore, US politicians, such as Secretary of State Antony Blinken, groundlessly hyped that China might supply weapons to Russia",
      " This is a threat in disguise as well as a warning to China",
      " Meanwhile, the US also wants to interfere with China's decision-making toward Russia",
      " Some political elites in the US believe that China's policy toward Russia needs to take into account the feelings of Washington",
      " In addition, the US is seeking to drag China into the Ukraine crisis created by the US in order to impair China's image and influence in the world",
      "This shows that Washington now has fewer policy instruments at hands, which is a symbol of the US' relative decline",
      "China has always underlined that China-Russia relations are not aimed at a third party",
      " The development of China-Russia relations has nothing to do with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, nor is it aimed at jointly resisting the US",
      " Instead, it is because bilateral cooperation can help the respective development of both sides",
      " China can provide Russia with a huge market and technology, while Russia can guarantee China's security on energy and northern border",
      "US President Joe Biden is visiting Poland on Tuesday",
      " Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Sunday that Poland is in talks with the Biden administration about increasing the US troop presence in his country",
      " Before the trip, he slipped into Kiev on Monday for the first time",
      "Answering a question after Wang delivered an address at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Saturday, he said that \"Everything China has done is aimed at facilitating peace through dialogue",
      " China will be firmly standing on the side of dialogue and peace",
      "\" In comparison, while the US is adding fuel to the fire, China is actively promoting talks",
      "Cui noted that this reflects the two countries' different concepts of security",
      " The US' security concept is a kind of exclusive Cold War mind-set - that is to defeat adversaries and squeezing their opponents' room, in a bid to achieve an absolute security",
      "China, on the other hand, has been promoting peace talks, advocating that security is not exclusive, but mutual",
      " Wang said on the MSC that human society must not repeat the old path of antagonism, division and confrontation, and must not fall into the trap of zero-sum game, war and conflict",
      " The West's practices on the Ukraine crisis is a continuation of Cold War camp confrontation mind-set, completely different from China's concept of security",
      "In the long run, the West's concept of security that is exclusive in nature is unlikely to work",
      " Instead, it can only provoke resistance from major powers and lead to geopolitical conflicts",
      " On the contrary, China's concept of security which puts emphasis on win-win result can truly solve security challenges",
      " China's concept of security contributes far more to world peace than the US' kind",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/Global TimesThese are peculiar and busy times in East Asia",
      " Peculiar, because this part of the world has enjoyed relative peace and stability as normality for more than a few decades, with most countries in the region consciously refraining from engaging in protracted and costly wars with one another, unlike in some other parts of the world where long and debilitating wars, both cross-border and domestic, have become the order of the day",
      "With such peace and stability came an energy and focus on development, which then led to prosperity for most countries in the region",
      " Indeed, since more than half a century ago, East Asia had clinched one economic miracle after another",
      " Even during the heights of the coronavirus pandemic, East Asia still enjoyed some of the highest economic growth figures globally",
      " But again, such spectacular achievements were fundamentally enabled by the peace and stability that have blessed the region",
      " There could be no development but only destruction if war befalls one's doorsteps",
      "In recent years the two superpowers eyeing each other across the vast Pacific Ocean increasingly do not see eye to eye with one another",
      " For many decades the US and China had enjoyed cordial and productive bilateral relations that brought about countless benefits for both sides",
      " Theirs was the largest amount of trade volume in world history",
      " Nevertheless, an increasingly bipartisan consensus was formed within American political elite circles that viewed a rising China as a malignant strategic competitor out to challenge the American global hegemony, a clear target to vigorously fight against, and not to assiduously work with as not so long ago",
      " Never mind if it were the Republicans or the Democrats who control either the White House or the US Congress - they mostly treat China as a mortal enemy to defeat the sooner the better",
      " Conversely, there also gradually emerged in China a view that sees the US as deliberating attempting to thwart China's rise to the world stage, a sort of containment which China must break free of in order to realize its national destiny",
      "And the result is the mounting confrontation - some would say deepening stalemate - between the two superpowers",
      " The long-standing north-south face-off on the Korean Peninsula continues unabated, there are still the uneasy tensions across the Taiwan Straits, and the run-ins on South China Sea where various regional claimants overlap in their disputed jurisdictions",
      "These are also busy times for the region in terms of security matters, in just the last few months alone",
      " With apparently tacit American acquiescence, Japan is in effect easing out of its post-WWII constitutional commitment to keep a minimal self-defense capacity, and sharply beefing up its military spending and capability, with a rising China in mind",
      " South Korea, under a new conservative government and always vigilant about challenges from its northern neighbor, is enhancing its already significant defense cooperation with the US",
      " Even the Philippines, although a treaty ally with the US who was ambivalent in its dealings with the US during its previous administration, is now expanding US military presence in the island country under a new administration",
      " European military vessels, which hitherto seldom made their presence felt in the region, are now also making their high-key rounds here one after another",
      " These are busy times indeed",
      "Against these peculiar and busy backgrounds, the secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Jens von Stoltenberg, recently visited Japan and South Korea, ostensibly to call upon the two relatively prosperous East Asian nations to provide more military assistance to Ukraine in the latter's almost year-long war with Russia",
      " But there were also calls and vows on closer cooperation between NATO and not only these two countries in particular, but also the other East Asian countries that are viewed as more closely aligned with the US and Europe in general",
      " All these gave rise to speculations on whether NATO is about to spread its wing to East Asia, or if an East Asian version of NATO is taking shape in the region, with China as the target of encirclement",
      "While a NATO \"extension\" into the region is perhaps something unprecedented, a regional version of NATO is actually not a novel idea",
      " Shortly after the formation of NATO in the middle of the last century, the US trained its attention to Asia, and instigated the formation of South East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) to contain the spread of communism in the region",
      " With the end of the Vietnamese War and the gradual replacement by the more economically focused Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the security-oriented SEATO became essentially defunct",
      " A \"revival\" of SEATO at this point in time would almost certainly take away the so-called centrality of ASEAN in regional security affairs",
      " ASEAN's centrality as such rests on both its long-cherished neutrality in global and regional affairs as well as its often clever diversion of potential conflicts into aspirations for development",
      " A more rigid \"revived\" SEATO would perhaps not harbor such neutrality and diverted aspirations when potential regional conflicts beckon",
      "Finally, a NATO expansion into the region would almost necessarily bring in not just American but also European actors into an East Asian theater, in addition to already quite formidable regional ones, should regional conflicts eventually erupt",
      " These would then be even more peculiar and busier times ahead",
      " Hopefully there could still be some space for much needed development",

      " French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna speaks during the Eleventh Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly on Ukraine, at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on February 23, 2023",
      " Photo: AFPOn the one-year anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the confrontation between the US, some Western countries and Russia has continued to intensify not only on the battlefield, but also at the United Nations (UN), where the 193-member UN General Assembly was due to vote on Thursday to call for an end to the conflict",
      " While Moscow said it's ready for a solution, the global community has raised questions about what kind of solution is really needed or whether the US-led West will further use the UNGA as a tool to pressure Russia",
      "In recent days, the US has been ramping up its distortions of China's balanced stance on the Ukraine issue by expressing so-called concerns over the latest meeting between Wang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, and Russian President Vladimir Putin",
      " It also hyped so-called China's weapons support for Russia, reflecting Washington's typical Cold War mentality and its ulterior motives of strategically containing Russia and China at the same time, Chinese officials and experts said",
      "As China is set to release a position paper on the Ukraine crisis soon, some experts believe that the document will insist on resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict through diplomatic channels, pointing out that the NATO-backed military confrontation and economic sanctions imposed by the US and Europe will only further escalate tensions",
      " Echoing China's Global Security Initiative (GSI) Concept Paper released on Tuesday, China's position on the Ukraine issue will call for the building of a fair international order, and a rejection of hegemony and a Cold War mindset, which are also the root causes of the conflict, experts noted",
      "'Tool of West'The UNGA is expected to endorse the resolution on Thursday, which demands that \"Russia unconditionally and immediately withdraw from Ukraine's territory",
      "\" Ukraine and its supporters hope to deepen Russia's diplomatic isolation by seeking \"yes\" votes from nearly three-quarters of the assembly, while Russia considers the draft resolution as anti-Russian, according to media reports",
      "Belarusian representatives have decided to try to balance the draft and come up with their amendments, including a prohibition on shipping weapons to the conflict zone and the need to tackle the root causes of the crisis, TASS said, citing Russian First Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Dmitry Polyansky",
      "Russia and Ukraine are highly divided on the draft resolution, as they have a different understanding of the root causes of the Ukraine crisis, Zhang Hong, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday",
      " \"The resolution won't have much impact on Russia,\" he said",
      "The UN is highly likely to adopt the resolution, but it's non-binding and has little value, which shows that ever since the Trump administration, the UNGA has basically become a political tool of the West to contain China and Russia, said Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University",
      "US Ukraine crisis Illustration: Liu Rui/GTWith the one-year anniversary of the Ukraine crisis coming up on Friday, geopolitical tension has continued to escalate, especially after US President Joe Biden met leaders of NATO's eastern flank in Poland on Wednesday, reaffirming Washington's commitment to the security of the bloc and support for Kiev",
      " He also made a surprise visit on Monday to the Ukrainian capital, the first time since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began",
      "\"There's no winner in conflict and confrontation",
      " Dialogue and negotiation are the only correct way to resolve the crisis,\" Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told a routine press conference onThursdaywhile commenting on Biden's latest repeat of commitment to Ukraine",
      " The Chinese official also urged the parties involved to play a constructive role in handling the crisis peacefully and pushing forward negotiations",
      "Some Western media and observers hinted at the coincidence of Biden making a surprise visit to Kiev as Chinese top diplomat Wang Yi visited Russia, speculating on China's \"alignment\" with Russia and its efforts to strike a balance between Europe and Russia",
      "\"The nature of the two visits is completely different",
      " Biden suddenly showed up in Kiev, but Wang's planned visit to Russia was announced earlier",
      " These two visits should not be brought up together in terms of timing,\" Fu Cong, Chinese envoy to the EU, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview",
      "China and the US also take very different positions, as Biden's visit to Ukraine was focused on the Ukraine crisis with the aim of supporting the continuation of the conflict, but Wang's visit to Russia not only focused on the Ukraine issue but also other aspects of China-Russia relations, Fu said",
      "\"When talking about the Ukraine issue, we always take a more fair and reasonable position",
      " We will not take sides but only promote peace, which is the main tone taken by Wang when talking about the Ukraine issue,\" the Chinese envoy said",
      "Stand with peace, dialogueDuring the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Wang Yi in Moscow on Wednesday, where the two sides exchanged in-depth views on the Ukrainian issue, Wang said China appreciates Russia's reiteration of its willingness to resolve the issue through dialogue",
      "China will, as always, uphold an objective and fair position in the political settlement of the crisis, the Chinese top diplomat said",
      "After wrapping up his visit to Europe, Wang told reporters on Thursday that during the trip, he felt that although the positions of all the parties concerned are different and even sharply opposed to each other, they all accept that the disputes should be resolved through dialogue and understand that a regional security structure should be established to achieve peace, and appreciate China's objective position and calm attitude",
      " They also expect China to play a more active role in the political settlement of the Ukraine issue, Wang said",

      "\"The Biden administration is also considering releasing intelligence that it believes shows China is weighing whether to supply weapons to support Russia's war in Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday, citing US officials",

      "The two vessels carried out the training test recently in a training center of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy",
      " During the training program, a formation of the two vessels intercepted missiles from enemy aircraft and became qualified in tests of air defense, a video PLA Navy released on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo platform showed on Sunday",
      " Since the training program started, the Guangxi has completed all the subjects of training and built up overall operational capability as an amphibious assault platform, Captain Xu Ce, skipper of the Guangxi, was quoted by China Central Television as saying",
      "During the program, the Hainan and the Guangxi focused on training on core capacities including multidimensional troop delivery and self-defense, and completed full-course qualification test scenarios which effectively enhanced their core operational capacities, the video showed",

      " As the PLA's first two amphibious assault ships, the two vessels' success in fulfilling the evaluation indicates that they had built up their operational capacities",
      " This will serve as vital experience for the PLA to deliver more amphibious assault ships and train their crews and enhance their operational capacities, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday",
      "Such experience will help the PLA to significantly shorten the period between the delivery of an amphibious assault ship and building up its operational capacity, according to Song",
      " He noted that in order to safeguard national territorial integrity and national sovereignty in the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea, the PLA Navy needs a large number of amphibious assault ships",
      " The Hainan was commissioned on April 23, 2021, and the Guangxi made its first public appearance in April this year after its commissioning",

      " Two Sessions Photo:XinhuaAs China prepares to kick off its annual two sessions on Saturday, what can be expected from one of China's most important political and economic events of the year? President Xi Jinping's remarks made at various top meetings over the past three months or so offer the clearest picture of what will top the agenda",
      "From the Central Economic Work Conference held in mid-December 2022 to the consultative meeting held by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee on Tuesday, Xi, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, has repeatedly stressed the importance of boosting economic development, accelerating the establishment of a new development pattern and advancing Chinese modernization",
      "In his remarks, Xi also addressed major issues for the country's economic work and called for various policy measures and reforms to ensure long-term, high-quality development",
      "In line with the top leader's focus, tackling various major issues facing the Chinese economy and ensuring both development and security through various policies and reforms will be key for this year's two sessions, according to national lawmakers and political advisors, economists and multinationals",
      "The 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body, will start its first session on Saturday, and the 14th National People's Congress (NPC), the national legislature, will open its first annual session on Sunday",
      " They are collectively known as the two sessions, during which Chinese officials and representatives of Chinese people of all walks of life usually set out economic and social development goals and plans to achieve them, among other tasks",
      "Important taskOne of the most closely watched items on the agenda for this year's two sessions are the election of leading officials at state institutions",
      "Speaking at the consultative meeting on Tuesday, Xi said that the election of new leading officials of state institutions and the new leadership of the CPPCC National Committee is an important task of the 2023 edition of the two sessions, and is also an important issue that concerns the overall situation, according to Xinhua",
      "Also, part of a plan for deepening the reform of the Party and state institutions, which was reviewed and adopted at the second plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Committee that concluded on Tuesday, will also be submitted to the first session of the 14th NPC for deliberation, Xinhua reported",
      "In general, the reform of the Party and state institutions this time, highlighting key industries and fields, is more targeted and intensified, covering many areas and involving a wide range of interests, Xi said",
      " It focuses on resolving challenging issues that are of great significance and of great concern to society, and will have an important impact on economic and social development, the President said, according to Xinhua",
      "As Xi has repeatedly stressed in various meetings, development remains the top priority for the CPC and will remain at the top of the agenda for this year's two sessions",
      "During the Central Economic Work Conference held in December, Xi reiterated that development should continue to be the CPC's top priority in governing and rejuvenating China",
      " At the meeting, which had set economic policy priorities for 2023, Xi also addressed major issues pertaining to the country's current economic work",
      "Xi pointed out that the economic work for 2023 is complicated, and it is necessary to bear in mind the overall strategic picture, focus on major problems and start with improving public expectations and boosting confidence in development, according to Xinhua",
      "Xi stressed efforts in five areas: expanding domestic demand, building a modern industrial system, deepening reforms of state-owned enterprises and improving the development environment for the private sector, increasing foreign investment, and preventing and defusing major economic and financial risks",
      "The calls made at the Central Economic Work Conference \"have made DSM full of confidence in the long-term, high-quality development of the Chinese market and offered strong impetus for DSM's long-term development in China,\" Zhou Tao, president of DSM China, told the Global Times",
      "DSM is a Netherlands-based multinational in the health, nutrition and bioscience fields",
      "The two sessions offer a crucial window for multinationals and the world to grasp the top policy priorities in the world's second-largest economy, a bright spot in a grim global economic outlook this year",
      "Zhou said that restoring and expanding consumption, promoting high-level opening-up to the outside world, and promoting low-carbon industrial transformation will also become hot topics at this year's two sessions",
      "\"Looking forward to 2023, which has already started, development is still the top priority,\" Zhang Xiaoyu, CEO ofAIA Life Insurance, told the Global Times",
      " He added that a series of major measures in the areas of expanding opening-up, supporting foreign businesses, and promoting stable, sound economic operations have lifted confidence",
      "Boosting confidenceGiven the top Chinese leadership's emphasis on lifting expectations and boosting confidence, higher economic goals and greater policy efforts are widely expected at this year's two sessions",
      "\"One of the most closely watched items is how China will set its growth target and relevant policies,\" Guan Tao, global chief economist at BOC International under Bank of China, told the Global Times on Thursday, noting that a \"more active tone\" is expected this year given the fast economic recovery so far in 2023",
      "GDP growth targets and other economic goals will be included in the Government Work Report, which will be delivered at the opening of this year's session of the National People's Congres, but many have been speculating about a higher GDP growth target this year",
      " Reuters, for example, reported that China may aim for up to 6 percent in growth in 2023",
      " Meanwhile, some Chinese economists expect a target of above 5 percent, noting that while growth is expected to pick up, officials may also leave some room to tackle external risks and other issues amid global turbulence",
      "In addition to boosting growth, China's top leadership has also been stressing the need to prevent and defuse financial risks and bolster China's technological self-reliance and strength, amid growing external risks, particularly from the US' relentless push for a so-called economic and technological decoupling",
      "Tackling the foreign \"stranglehold\" on certain technologies will also become a top topic at the two sessions, with some NPC deputies and CPPCC national committee members making related suggestions and proposals",
      " For example, Zhong Zheng, an NPC deputy and CFO at Midea Group, suggested ways to solve the \"stranglehold\" issue in core components of industrial robots, according to her suggestions shared with the Global Times",
      "Also, in the face of a global economic downturn and turbulent geo-economic situation, another key task for this year's two sessions is conveying confidence to the market through supportive measures in areas such as foreign investment and the private sector, some NPC deputies and CPPCC national committee members said",

      " Illustration: Liu Rui/GTA US delegation led by Assistant US Trade Representative Terry McCartin kicked off the second round of talks with Taiwan authorities in Taipei of the so-called Initiative on 21st-Century Trade, which is expected to last until January 17",
      " The talks, like previous ones, are not expected to yield substantial results, as they are a political show for both sides, Chinese mainland experts said",
      "The talks, which started on Saturday, will discuss a total of 11 major issues, with the separatist DPP authorities hoping to prioritize four issues: trade facilitation, small- and medium-sized enterprises, anti-corruption and good regulatory practices",
      " But observers say the US will not really promote matters that will benefit the island's livelihood, but is only aimed at using the island as a pawn to counter the Chinese mainland",
      "The Chinese mainland on Wednesday again expressed its firm opposition to the US negotiating any agreement with Taiwan island that has sovereignty implications or is official in nature",
      "We urge the US to take practical actions to abide by the one-China principle and the provisions of the three joint communiqu\u00e9s",
      " Attempts to play the \"Taiwan card\" to hinder China's reunification and national rejuvenation will not succeed, said Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council on Wednesday",
      " The DPP authorities are also warned that there will be a price to pay for the action of colluding with external forces and selling out the interests of islanders for political gains",
      "The initiative was launched in June 2022, shortly after the US announced the so-called Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which left out Taiwan island despite the DPP's eagerness to join",
      " A couple of rounds of talks have been held, including meetings in November 2022",
      "Experts noted that like the previous stalemate, it seems that it will be hard for negotiations on the trade initiative to make substantial progress in this round, the underlying reason being that the US does not really expect and promote economic and trade cooperation with the Taiwan authorities, but only uses it as a pawn to counter the Chinese mainland",
      "\"There is a huge gap between the US' goals and the expectations of the Taiwan authorities,\" said Wang Jianmin, a senior cross-Straits expert at Minnan Normal University in Fujian Province, noting that since the US does not want to completely anger the Chinese mainland, it will not meet DPP authorities' demands",
      "Echoing Wang, Tang Yonghong, deputy director of the Taiwan Research Center at Xiamen University, also pointed out that DPP's demands are unlikely to be met, citing the island's unsuccessful appeal to join the IPEF",
      "\"The current negotiations are also a way for the US to appease the DPP authorities after the unsuccessful appeal,\" Tang said",
      "Even if a so-called economic and trade agreement can be reached, it will not be of any substantial help to Taiwan's economic and social development, Tang added",
      "According to public release, the initiative mainly focuses on coordination in trade facilitation, but has limited substance in terms of liberalizing economic and trade activities, such as opening up investment and trade, which means that people on both sides will not profit from the possible outcome",
      "The fact that the US has sent a delegation of more than 20 people to Taipei for face-to-face negotiations has been interpreted by some Taiwan-based media outlets as a sign of the rising importance of the Taiwan in the eyes of the US, and they inferred that the island will hold some bargaining power in this negotiation",
      "However, this is entirely wishful thinking, experts said",
      "\"The basic pattern of concessions from the Taiwan authorities to the US in this negotiation is unlikely to change, considering the unequal power and status of the two sides,\" Wang told the Global Times on Sunday",
      " \"With the US currently hoping to use the island of Taiwan to suppress and confront the Chinese mainland, it is possible that the US will make concessions in some areas",
      " But 'America first' would be the basic pattern of negotiations",
      "\"Observers noted that despite the fact that the talks would not lead to substantive results, the Taiwan authorities are still willing to engage in the negotiations because it is a much needed political show",

      " Suggestions include scrapping the requirement to be legally married to register and give birth, and granting children born to unmarried parents equal rights",
      "Xie Wenmin, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), is going to submit a proposal to do away with the need to be married to give birth, and to allow all the newborns to be eligible for household registration, no matter the circumstances of their birth",
      " This means that unmarried parents, or those who have more than three children, would be able to register their children legally",
      "She also called to grant equal rights to children born to unmarried parents, such as schooling, healthcare and employment, according to her proposal which was viewed by the Global Times on Wednesday",
      "In China, before women can have access to birth-related services or enjoy preferential policies including birth insurance, they should first of all register the births of their children and the number of their children",
      " Getting married is a premise for this registration",
      "Some of China's most populous and prosperous provinces and regions, including South China's Guangdong, Southwest China's Sichuan and East China's Shanghai, are among the forerunners to have already canceled such restrictions",
      "The first session of the 14th National People's Congress is scheduled to open on March 5, and the first session of the 14th CPPCC National Committee is set to begin on March 4",
      "Boosting the birth rate is a hot topic for this year's two sessions",
      " Yang Xiaoqin, a CPPCC member from Sichuan Province, proposed exempting all medical fees related to childbirth and slashing mortgage rates for families with three children",
      "Her view echoes that of Zhu Lieyu, an NPC deputy and a Guangzhou-based lawyer who advocates granting rights and treatment for unmarried women to have children that are equal to those of married women, and to scrap China's family planning policies completely to boost the country's fertility rate",

      "6 per thousand, the country's National Statistics Bureau announced on Tuesday",
      " Last month, the bureau announced that the population in the Chinese mainland recorded negative growth for the first time in 61 years",
      "Jiang Shengnan, a member of CPPCC National Committee told the Global Times she proposed to guarantee that young people work only eight hours per day so that \"they can have sufficient time to fall in love, get married and have children",
      "\"She believed that as the brutal \"996\" work culture has become normal in some companies in China, many youngsters in this country do not have personal lives, thus the marriage and birth rates keep declining",
      " \"Giving young people more time for leisure will keep society more vibrant,\" Jiang said",
      "Some CPPCC members have formed proposals which would relieve the financial burdens of bringing up children",
      "Gan Huatian, a CPPCC member, proposed offering free education for the third child of a family, and to provide education subsidies for families with two or three children",
      "Gan said that allowing families to have three instead of two children did not achieve the desired result, and education is one of the major barriers",
      "In May 2021, China announced that it would allow couples to have up to three children",
      "Gan also proposed to offer free healthcare for children under the age of 6, and offering tax discounts for family with children",

      " On Tuesday and Wednesday, the 29th regular consultation between China and Japan diplomatic authorities, the 17th China-Japan security dialogue, and the 16th China-Japan economic partnership consultation were held successively",
      " This series of consultations show that the long-frozen bilateral contacts between China and Japan are recovering, and to a certain extent, it sends a positive signal of stabilizing China-Japan relations",
      "China-Japan relations are currently in an abnormally chilly state, which is in urgent need to return to the mechanism of bilateral consultation and security dialogue",
      " The security dialogue was put on hold for four years due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid deterioration of the China-Japan ties, which greatly damaged the political and security mutual trust between the two countries",
      "In November last year, Chinese and Japanese leaders held a meeting in Bangkok, and agreed to maintain high-level exchanges, dialogue and communication",
      " On February 18, during his attendance at the Munich Security Conference, Wang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, met Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi",

      " These dialogues are the implementation of the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries",
      " But it also reflects the many problems that have accumulated in China-Japan relations",
      "Japan in particular has shown a sense of tension and urgency",
      " But it must be said that Japan has missed the point",
      " Japan feels nervous and uncomfortable about China's rapid development, and feels an urgent need to address the situation in the Taiwan Straits that has nothing to do with it",
      " This self-inflicted anxiety has led to a \"vicious spiral\" in Japan's China policy in recent years",
      " What Japan should really be worried about is the downward trend in China-Japan relations, which is indeed dangerous",
      " After all, there are some real contradictions between China and Japan, such as territorial disputes and well-known historical grievances",
      " It was the four political documents between China and Japan that managed to taken them under control and helped realize a good situation of mutual benefit and cooperation between the two countries",
      " Japan should have been the party that cherishes the four documents the most, and its offending the four documents is unreasonable",
      "Tokyo has shown an extremely awkward attitude toward China, which can be seen from its contact with China",
      " According to media reports, Japan has actively sought high-level dialogues with China on several occasions, but has been unwilling to make substantive adjustments to its China policy",
      " Instead, it has continuously strengthened its hostile attitude toward China, which has seriously deteriorated the atmosphere of bilateral relations",
      "What Tokyo needs is not a sense of formality, but a sincere and constructive attitude that can be felt by others",
      " It emphasizes the importance of communication, but there is much more that Japan needs to explain and clarify to China, such as what is the purpose of Japan's purchase of 500 Tomahawk missiles? Does Japan's revision of the three security documents mean that the exclusively defense-oriented principle has been broken through? Are the four political documents between China and Japan still binding on Tokyo? And so on",
      "China is not as ambivalent and contradictory as Japan",
      " Simply put, we use \"two hands\" to deal with Japan's \"two faces",
      "\" We will not hesitate to counter and strike back Japan's words and actions that harm our interests, while at the same time maintaining communication and exchange with Japan to stabilize bilateral relations",

      "Both China and Japan believe it is necessary to strengthen communication, and accelerate the establishment of important consensus between the leaders of the two countries -- a \"constructive and stable relationship",
      "\" During the meeting in Bangkok, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida stated that as close neighbors, Japan and China pose no threat to each other, and the two sides need to and should coexist in peace",
      " He also said that Japan could hardly achieve development and prosperity without China, and the same is true the other way around",
      " Japan welcomes China's positive contribution to the world through its own development",
      " We look forward to seeing more of this attitude from Japan's actual actions",
      "This year marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship",

      " Whether China-Japan relations should take the right path based on this framework, or bypass it and take the evil path of confrontation with the Western political bloc, Japan is currently standing at a crossroads",

      "The US statement disregarded the truth and is pure slander and hype, said Senior Colonel Tian Junli, a spokesperson of the PLA Southern Theater Command, in a statement on Saturday",
      "Tian's statement is a response to a recent US military statement claiming a PLA Navy J-11 fighter jet came within six meters of a US Air Force RC-135 aircraft over the South China Sea on December 21, forcing the US aircraft to take evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision in international airspace, Reuters reported on Friday",
      "A US RC-135 aircraft conducted intentional close-in reconnaissance on China's southern coastline and the Xisha Islands of Hainan, South China's Hainan Province on December 21",
      " The PLA Southern Theater Command organized aerial forces to conduct tracking and monitoring through its entire course, Tian said",
      "Despite multiple warnings from the Chinese side, the US aircraft suddenly altered its flight stance, pushed the Chinese aircraft toward left in a dangerous approach movement, which seriously compromised the flight safety of the Chinese military aircraft, severely violated the Rules of Behavior for Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters between China and the US as well as related international law and practices, the spokesperson said",
      "A video documenting the incident from the perspective of the Chinese J-11 fighter jet was attached to Tian's statement, which showed the US RC-135 intentionally altered its flight stance in a dangerous approach toward the Chinese aircraft at 11:25 am on December 21",
      "From the video released by the Chinese side, it is obvious that the US aircraft actively maneuvered left toward the Chinese aircraft, verifying that it was the US side that engaged in dangerous moves, a Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Saturday",
      "On the other hand, the video release by the US only showed the Chinese aircraft flying alongside the US aircraft without making any dangerous maneuvers, the expert said",
      "The Chinese pilot took professional and standard action according to laws and regulations, fully reflecting the Chinese military's responsible attitude toward regional safety and the safety of frontline personnel, Tian said",
      "\"The US side intentionally misled the public, called black white, blamed on China while itself is to be blamed and attempted to confuse international opinion,\" he said",
      "\"We sternly require the US to restrain the movements of its frontline maritime and aerial forces, strictly abide by related international laws and related agreements and prevent maritime and aerial accidents,\" Tian said",

      "Top Chinese aircraft including the Y-20 large transport aircraft and the FC-31 stealth fighter jet are also offered to the international market at the event",
      "Having already successfully signed a contract with the UAE over the L15 project, China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation (CATIC) again displayed the aircraft at the 16th International Defense Exhibition and Conference (IDEX 23), which is being held from Monday to Friday, the Global Times learned on Tuesday from the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China, the maker of the aircraft",
      "The done deal was announced after the Defense Ministry of the UAE revealed in February 2022 that it intended to buy 12 L15s from China, with the option for 36 additional aircraft of the same type in the future",
      "The L15 displayed at IDEX 23 is painted in the colors of the UAE Air Force, and it has been equipped with the additional capability for aerial refueling, AVIC said",
      "As the new generation of light attack and combat trainer jet independently developed by China, the L15 can be used to train pilots for fourth- and fifth-generation fighter jets, or it can also carry out air-to-air combat and land attack missions, according to an AVIC press release",
      "Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military aviation expert who participated in the evaluation of the L15 before it was commissioned in the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force under the designation of the JL-10, told the Global Times that the L15 is an outstanding trainer with excellent maneuverability and a fly-by-wire flight control system",
      "Many pilots who have flown the L15 drew the conclusion that the trainer is on par with fourth-generation fighter jets, Fu said",
      "\"If a fourth-generation fighter jet engages an L15 in a dogfight, the trainer might end up winning,\" Fu said, highlighting that this means the L15 is well-liked by pilots and it can serve well to train cadets in piloting skills and tactics",

      " Finding a political solution to achieve a lasting peace therefore needs to be at the top of the international agenda",
      " China's recently released 12-point peace plan calling for dialogue and negotiations to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflict should be warmly welcomed across the world",
      " Importantly both Russia and Ukraine have expressed an interest in China's proposal",
      "Unfortunately, pushing for peace runs counter to the agenda of the US, which created the conditions for war by pushing for NATO expansion, despite the fact it knew this crossed red lines of Russia's security interests",
      " Following this the US has escalated its proxy war in Ukraine over the past year with the goal of \"weakening Russia",
      "\" That is why, despite the interest expressed by other countries, China's peace plan has been rejected by the US",
      "In order to find a political solution to bring peace to Ukraine it is crucial to understand not merely immediate but the underlying causes of this war which must obviously be discussed in peace negotiations",
      "The war was the result of the US' unwise and aggressive foreign policy, which has seen a hostile nuclear armed military alliance - NATO - expand up to Russia's border",
      " The eastward expansion of NATO has taken place despite repeated assurances that the US made to the Soviet Union at the time of the Cold War's end that NATO would not, in the words of the then US Secretary of State James Baker, expand \"an inch\" eastward",
      "The proposal for Ukraine to join NATO is a threat to Russia as it would enable the US to station weapons on Ukrainian territory within a few minutes flight time of Moscow",
      " Russia made it clear that Ukraine joining NATO was a red line that they would not tolerate being crossed, but the US proceeded to push this forward regardless",
      "As China's peace plan makes clear, guarantees for the security of both Ukraine and Russia is therefore crucial for delivering a lasting peace",
      " In this framework the importance of Ukraine ruling out membership of NATO is important for bringing about peace in Ukraine",
      " In fact, the war in Ukraine could have been avoided had the US not pushed for Ukraine's membership of NATO",
      "Successful peace negotiations will also require the democratic rights, including the rights of minorities within Ukraine, to be respected",
      "Protection for the rights of Russian speaking minority within Ukraine and democratic rights for all is therefore another key issue that would need to be addressed in peace talks",
      "There is much to be discussed, but the goal must be to settle these issues in negotiations and not on a battlefield",
      "Instead of pushing for negotiations and a political solution to achieve a lasting peace, the US is in fact escalating the war in Ukraine",
      " NATO countries in Europe have been dragged into supporting this conflict, and have followed Washington's lead by sending tens of billions of dollars' worth of weapons into Ukraine",
      "A push toward escalation is not in the interests of the people of Ukraine, Russia, Europe, the US or the rest of the world",
      "Tens of thousands of people have already paid with their lives in Ukraine",
      " Many more will lose their lives if this war continues to escalate",
      "The enormous sums of money being spent on the war in Ukraine by the US and European countries could be much better utilized to tackle the cost of living crisis, climate change, fund health and education services and pursue economic development all over the world",
      "Millions of people in Europe are now protesting against the economic policies of their governments",
      " At the same time as European governments are neglecting the living standards of their own populations, they are pushing toward greatly increasing military spending",
      "The perspective of the Global South on the Ukraine war, which largely takes the same position as China, was eloquently expressed in a statement by Namibia's Prime Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila at the recent Munich Security Conference in February 2023 when she said: \"we are promoting a peaceful resolution of that conflict so that the entire world and all the resources of the world can be focused on improving the conditions of people around the world instead of being spent on acquiring weapons, killing people, and actually creating hostilities",
      "\"China's peace plan states that the \"international community should stay committed to the right approach of promoting talks for peace",

      " Between April 2020 and April 2021, 75,000 Americans died from opium overuse, representing more than 75 percent of the total deaths from drug overdose and a 50 percent rise year on year",
      "Each year, 95,000 people in the country die from alcohol abuse",
      " During the COVID-19 pandemic, over 60 percent of Americans increased their consumption of alcohol",
      "Also, adolescents are experiencing the fastest rise in drug overdose deaths",
      " In this group, 18 to 25-year-olds are the heaviest drug users, with 39 percent of them using drugs",
      " Seventy percent of drug users try illicit drugs before the age of 13, and drug users as a population group are becoming younger",
      " The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) reports that between January and June 2021, about 1,150 youngsters aged 14 to 18 died from drug overdose, a 20 percent increase from that of 2020 and more than double the number in 2019",
      "Drug abuse has led to enormous social cost in the country",
      "Drug overdose exacts a high death toll on the US population, greatly eroding the labor force base and weighing on life expectancy",
      " According to a report in the American journal Science, the American death toll from drug overdose has increased exponentially over the past 38 years - up 9 percent almost every year and doubling about every eight years",
      " A record 72,000 deaths were registered in 2017",
      "The damage to cranial nerves caused by drug taking may aggravate anxiety and cognitive disorder, induce some mental illnesses, and cause emotion dysregulation, thus leading to problems like family discord, violent crimes, and psychological trauma in children",
      "Also, drug control measures incur tremendous social costs",
      " Since 1971, the US has spent 1 trillion dollars combating drug-related crimes, according to a study by the University of Pennsylvania",
      " In 2017, the cost of drug control in the US exceeded $270 billion",
      "The report pointed out that the US government has pushed for the legalization of cannabis and other drugs out of economic considerations",
      " Legalizing cannabis allows the government to generate significant tax revenues from the legal drug market, and in turn, the distribution of such revenues becomes an important driver of drug legalization",
      "The drug problem is a manifestation of the US' failure in social governance",
      " According to Howard Koh, former assistant secretary for health for the US Department of Health and Human Services, drug and substance abuse in the country is one of its most devastating public health disasters",
      " In addition to putting a heavy burden on the public health system, it could lead to millions of people losing their homes or jobs, truancy or family breakdown",
      " The COVID-19 pandemic masked this crisis, but at the same time also amplified it",
      " The crisis shows the US government's failed regulation across multiple systems, and it is imperative to make a prompt, unified and comprehensive response, he said",

      "cn/Photo by Li Tang)The aircraft carrier Liaoning of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy reportedly hosted about 130 aircraft sorties in four days after it entered the West Pacific for far sea drills last week, more than twice as intensive as the exercises held in the same region in May, displaying the carrier's high level of combat readiness, analysts said on Thursday",
      "Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force spotted the PLA Navy's Liaoning aircraft carrier group, including the Type 055 large destroyers Anshan and Wuxi, the Type 052D destroyer Chengdu, the Type 054A frigate Zaozhuang and the Type 901 comprehensive replenishment ship Hulunhu, sailing in the West Pacific south of Japan around Okidaitojima island and Kitadaitojima island from Saturday to Tuesday, Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff said in a press release on Wednesday",
      "During this period, the Liaoning hosted about 60 sorties of carrier-based fighter jets and about 70 sorties of carrier-based helicopters, or about 130 aircraft sorties in total, read the Japanese press release",
      " According to photos attached to the release, J-15 fighter jets from the aircraft carrier Liaoning carried air-to-air missiles in their sorties",
      "By comparison, the Liaoning hosted more than 300 fighter jet and helicopter sorties in some 20 days in the far sea exercises in the West Pacific in May, and it was deemed by observers as the most sortie-intensive exercise by the Chinese carrier in the region at the time",
      "This means that the aircraft sorties during the four days were more than twice as intensive as the exercise in May, and if the Liaoning keeps training at this rate, this voyage will set a record, a Chinese military expert told the Global Times on Thursday, requesting anonymity",
      "By ramping up aircraft sorties in the drills, the Liaoning is increasing its capabilities and demonstrating a high level of combat readiness, the expert said",
      "Japan reported details of the Liaoning's exercises, wanting to hype the \"China threat\" theory, but it also let the outside world know how capable the PLA Navy is more objectively, the expert said",
      "The PLA Navy flotilla led by the aircraft carrier Liaoning sailed from the East China Sea via the Miyako Strait into the West Pacific on December 16, Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff said at the time",
      "Before this, Japan also reported that a PLA Navy flotilla consisting of the Type 055 large destroyer Lhasa, the Type 052D destroyer Kaifeng and the Type 903A replenishment ship Taihu sailed from the East China Sea through the Osumi Strait into the West Pacific from December 13 to 14, but those ships were not seen around the aircraft carrier Liaoning from Saturday to Tuesday",
      "This might indicate that this is a separate flotilla from the Liaoning aircraft carrier group on another far sea exercise, possibly making a circumnavigation sail around Japan, observers said",
      "In another development, China and Russia started the week-long Joint Sea 2022 naval exercise in the East China Sea on Wednesday",
      "While the exercises are not targeted at any third party, they serve as deterrence against those who make provocations, analysts said",

      " Photo: Screenshot of CCTV reportChina's second aircraft carrier, the Shandong, recently conducted realistic combat-oriented training in the South China Sea, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Wednesday",
      " The announcement came amid the reported fighter jet drills of China's first aircraft carrier theLiaoning in the West Pacific",
      " Two aircraft carriers hosting drills in two different directions demonstrated China's aircraft carriers' enhanced capacity and the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy's strong capability, analysts said",
      "The drill of the Shandong aircraft carrier started with several J-15 fighter jets soaring into the sky, according to a video revealed by CCTV",
      "Song Zhihao, an aircraft takeoff assistant on the Shandong, told CCTV that training difficulty has been increased this time",
      "During the exercise, the Shandong carried out targeted training, gradually improved its core combat capabilities such as landing and take-off, emergency response, and damage control under complex environmental conditions",
      " It also verified a large number of emergency response plans, training methods, and support models, CCTV said in the report",
      "Since the Shandong was commissioned, it has focused on the needs of the future naval battlefield and successfully carried out various tasks such as dispatching the maximum number of J-15 carrier-based fighter jets in a single batch, dispatching the maximum number of aircraft in multiple batches and landing and take-off in the night, according to CCTV",
      "The announcement of the training for the Shandong in the South China Sea came shortly after China's Liaoning aircraft carrier group - with two Type 055 10,000 ton-class large destroyers among others in the flotilla - held drills in the West Pacific waters east of the island of Taiwan and south of Japan as well as west of Guam in December 2022, hosting intensive fighter jet and helicopter takeoff and landing drills under the close watch of Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force",
      "After the training for the Shandong in the South China Sea was announced, analysts noted that holding both aircraft carrier drills in different sea regions demonstrated the enhancement of China's aircraft carriers' capacity and the PLA Navy's strong capability",
      " The drills would also help to stabilize the situation in the West Pacific and the South China Sea given the US' provocation against China in these areas in recent times, experts pointed out",
      " With more exercises, the Shandong, which entered PLA Navy service in December 2019, is expected to gradually achieve higher operational capability and eventually surpass the level of the Liaoning, and will sail further in addition to the South China Sea, experts said",

      " A view of Sydney Photo: VCGEditor's Note:China and Australia celebrated the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties last month",
      " In the eyes of Stephen FitzGerald (FitzGerald), Australia's first ambassador to China, the essential ingredient that made the two countries drop differences and establish ties was mutual self-interest and realpolitik, while the most important thing lost in the bilateral tensions in the past few years was confidence and trust between the two governments",
      " Global Times (GT) reporter Wang Wenwen talked to FitzGerald on his memory of 50 years ago and his view on the prospect of China-Australia relations",
      "Stephen FitzGerald Photo: Horace LiGT: As the first ambassador to China, can you tell us why the leaders of China and Australia were able to seek common ground while reserving differences and actively develop bilateral relations 50 years ago?FitzGerald: You have to look at both the Chinese side and the Australian side",
      " On the Chinese side, China had been through a period of internal upheaval and disorder known as the Cultural Revolution",
      " And it had become relatively isolated throughout that period",
      " Premier Zhou Enlai had done his best to try to maintain order in China's foreign relations",
      " It wasn't always easy",
      " But then by the time, it came to the initiative from Australia",
      " Premier Zhou was already able to move decisively in reestablishing China's network of international relations and in developing relations with countries that China not had relations with before",
      "On the Australian side, the prime mover was Gough Whitlam",
      " First of all, he went to China when he was leader of the opposition in the middle of 1971",
      " He had a long meeting with premier Zhou in which it was agreed that if Whitlam and the Labour party won government at the next election, which was due at the end of 1972, we would have diplomatic relations",
      "How were they able to do this while having fundamentally different political systems and interests? The essential ingredient, I think, was mutual self interest and realpolitik",
      " In other words, it was realism in international affairs",
      " In that meeting we had with the premier Zhou in 1971, it was recorded by journalists who were asked to remain in the meeting for the whole of the interview, which was rather unusual",
      " And in that, premier Zhou was totally non-ideological",
      " He was just talking about practicality, power politics, the Soviet Union, the US, and the issues involving China's relations with all of these countries and with the rest of the world",
      "And for Whitlam's part, he wanted China's system to remain as it was",
      " But he was also non ideological",
      " That was very important because the government in Australia that had gone before Whitlam was quite ideological and heavily tied to the ideas and thinking of the US",
      " Whitlam broke with that",
      " It became a matter of realism",
      " At that time, Australia still recognized the government of the Kuomintang in Taiwan as the government of the whole of China",
      " And Whitlam said that is nonsense",
      " How can they possibly be the government of the whole of China? And he said we have to move to recognizing the government in Beijing as the government of China",
      "So that's how they were able to do it",
      " In the long meeting they had in 1971, they did discuss differences",
      " They discussed Australia's relationship with the US",
      " And both sides held firm to their views on the US, but they were able to move forward",
      "GT: After you returned to Australia, did you often go back to China?FitzGerald: I went back often",
      " After I finished being ambassador in China, I went back to work at the Australian National University in Canberra for a couple of years",
      " And then I left the university and set up my own consulting business",
      " Because at that time, Deng Xiaoping had proclaimed the open-door policy",
      " This was a moment I thought we had to seize this opportunity",
      " So I set up this consulting business",
      " I introduced many Australian companies to China",
      " I also introduced many state governments and cities to have sister relations with their counterparts in China",
      "So I was going in the 1990s sometimes up to 10 times a year to China with various clients",
      " They were discussing projects everywhere",
      " We had a joint venture project to grow pineapples in Guangxi, with a mining company that had a joint venture in Xinjiang near the border of Kazakhstan",
      " And that same company was operating down in the very south of China on the border with Vietnam",
      " I loved those opportunities to go to those parts of China, which I hadn't been able to do before when I was working as ambassador in Beijing",
      "GT: In a recent interview with The Australian, you said that Australia must keep away from megaphone diplomacy in terms of China relations",
      " Why did you say so?FitzGerald: I don't think that megaphone diplomacy serves any useful purpose unless you want to just be an enemy of another country",
      " It is far better to practice good statecraft and diplomacy",
      " I'm afraid that under the previous Australian government, which was defeated in the election in Australia in May of 2022, they at the slightest pretext would speak out now to criticize China on everything relating to Xinjiang or Hong Kong, or particularly COVID",
      "On the question of COVID, instead of just quietly using diplomacy and saying \"Can we sit down with you to discuss this together?\", suddenly they announced, as it were through the megaphone, that there should be an inquiry and investigation into what had gone on in China in a very, I thought, antagonistic tone",
      " It served no purpose",
      " And our relations continued to deteriorate",
      " That's why I was critical of so-called megaphone diplomacy",
      "GT: Does China really pose a \"clear and real danger\" to Australia and the US, in your eyes and the eyes of other older generation Australian politicians? Is Australia's foreign policy losing its autonomy because it closely follows the US?FitzGerald: I don't know that we can generalize about the older generation of Australian politicians",
      " There would be different views among them",
      " But certainly, from my point of view, and from the point of view, for example, of the former prime minister of Australia, Paul Keating, I believe that we should not be as closely aligned with the US as we have become in recent years",
      " I believe that we should not have our defense forces and our intelligent services so intertwine, because this imposes a degree of constraint on our independence in foreign policy",
      "For example, if our intelligent services accept the views of the US intelligence community, which are by and large very critical and antagonistic toward China, that influences the kind of advice that they give to the Australian government",
      " So it does really restrict our room for maneuver",
      " We have to move away from that",
      "GT: China-Australia ties remained lukewarm or even cold in the past 7 years",
      " What losses have been brought to each side?FitzGerald: The most obvious losses were in the area of trade and investment for Australia - large numbers of Chinese students studying in our universities, large numbers of tourists coming from China to Australia",
      " This was a big loss, but more deeply, we had a relationship with China that included a degree of mutual confidence and trust",
      " That was really important to maintaining a stable relationship, one in which we could have close relations on many things, even while we had differences on others",
      " I think one of the things we lost in that period was the confidence and trust between the two governments",
      " That is possibly going to be the hardest part to rebuild now that there has been a change of government",
      "GT: Why is the Australian government's relationship with China getting more and more out of track? Is this directly related to the ruling party?FitzGerald: Yes, it was definitely related to the ruling party under the previous government",
      " And it's because that government itself was ideological",
      " It was really much too close to the hawks in the US government",
      " It was also quite influenced by right-wing hawks in the Australian parliament and in parts of the Australian bureaucracy, and also right-wing think tanks, one of the most influential of which is heavily funded by the defense and armament industries and the US government",
      " Those who ran the government were really not thinking for themselves, but heavily influenced by those people and those forces",
      " Not all, but most of them were inexperienced in international affairs",
      " They were not really able to effectively question the advice that they were receiving from these right-wing forces",
      "GT: If the Australian government turns to statecraft and moves away from \"megaphone diplomacy\", will relations with China improve?FitzGerald: Yes, I am optimistic",
      " Although I'm no longer in government, as far as I can see, there is a lot of goodwill on both sides",
      " With that goodwill and with the use of statecraft and diplomacy, we can build toward a new and constructive and trusting relationship",
      "We do have a formal agreement to have a comprehensive strategic partnership under the years of the previous government that just fell into disuse",
      " No one mentioned it",
      " Now that has been mentioned again since the change of government",
      " The two sides have already identified possible areas for cooperation, which would benefit greatly not just our bilateral relations, but the wider international system",
      " I think we can collaborate on building or rebuilding elements of multilateral organizations, including, for example, the WTO",
      " We both have a very strong interest in working together on climate change",
      " So, I think the conditions are there for us to rebuild the relationship in a very constructive way",
      "GT: In a recent remark, China's ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian said there is a \"new consensus\" in the bilateral relationship",
      " What's your understanding of that?FitzGerald: I really have to compliment Chinese ambassador Xiao Qian",
      " Since he arrived in Australia, which was almost a year ago, he has been working very hard and very diplomatically, in a sensitive and sophisticated way to try to establish what he called a rebalancing of the relationship",
      "He has been very active in that",
      " He has spoken publicly, for example, at the national press club",
      " He has written articles for newspapers that made himself available for interview",
      " He is a really, really effective and professional diplomat",
      " So, if he says there is the opportunity for a new consensus, I not only believe him, but I'm quite optimistic",
      "GT: What hidden dangers does AUKUS pose to the normal development of China-Australia relations?FitzGerald: It is the most recent and most publicly binding expression of what I referred to as entanglement, the intertwining of defense and intelligence agencies",
      " The submarine sale to Australia, if indeed it ever happens because there is some question about this, is just a ramping up of the same conditions that existed before",
      " So, I think we can manage it as we have done in the past",
      "If I may go back to the time when we established relations, the Vietnam War was raging",
      " The US decided to bomb the city of Hanoi and the new Labour government, while maintaining the relationship with the US saying we are friends with the US, we have an alliance with the US, but the Labour government of Whitlam was highly critical of American actions, putting a distance thereby between Australia and the USs to an extent that for quite many months, the American government refused to even receive a visit from the new Australian prime minister",
      "So that shows that it can be done",
      " And I think looking at the way the Australian government is handling this at the moment, particularly Foreign Minister Penny Wong",
      " I think the maturity that is being shown and the sensitivity give us quite some promise of being able to resolve this issue in our relations with China",
      " "

      " How will the so-called balloon incident impact bilateral ties? Will a major conflict between the two countries be unavoidable? Global Times reporters Xie Wenting and Bai Yunyi (GT) conducted an exclusive interview with George Yeo (Yeo), former Singaporean minister of foreign affairs on these matters",
      " GT: From your point of view, how will the so-called balloon incident influence China-US relations? Do you think the \"balloon incident\" will be a turning point in the downward spiral of China-US relations?Yeo: There's a desire on both sides to bring relations back on track following the meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden in Bali",
      " And out of that meeting was the plan for US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China",
      " Because of this balloon incident, the visit will have to be postponed until conditions are right",
      " And the conditions require taking domestic politics in the US into account",
      " There is a clamor for a strong reaction against China",
      " This makes it difficult for the White House and the US government to get back to what was agreed upon between the two leaders",
      " So a certain amount of time is necessary for emotions to cool down",

      " I don't think the balloon incident will define bilateral relations",
      " The balloon incident shows how strong anti-China sentiments are politically in the US",
      " The balloon incident can get bigger if both sides mismanage reactions to it",
      " But if both sides take a calm approach and allow for domestic political reactions in the US to gradually calm down, then we can get back on track",
      " But it requires very careful management of the incident on both sides",
      "China's response has been measured",
      " That is a signal on the US side",
      " The White House also does not want the issue to get out of control",
      " But domestic politics in the US are a reality show, which the White House has to take into account",
      "I'll give it a bit of time",
      " Sooner or later, some other issues will become important",
      " It's clear that the US does not want a big problem with China because it has a big problem in Europe",
      " In Europe, there is an ongoing war which can escalate out of control",
      " This is much more serious than balloons",
      " I don't think policymakers in the US want to have tense relations with China when they have to worry much more about the current war in Europe",
      "GT: How do you view the connection between the \"balloon incident\" and Washington's previously reported moves on the restriction of technology exports to China? Will this incident lead the US administration to further tighten restrictions on the export of technologies to China?Yeo: The US can use the balloon as another excuse to tighten restrictions further",
      " They can use all kinds of reasons",
      " They can find many other \"reasons\" for restricting technology exports to China if they want to",
      "China has behaved in a reasonably disciplined way, not showing weakness but also not escalating unnecessarily",

      "GT: In light of the response to the balloon, do you think the Chinese and US governments have demonstrated the ability to avoid a miscalculation and conflict in the event of a major crisis? Have guardrails been built between the two countries?Yeo: I would put it this way",
      " If a balloon can create such a domestic storm in the US, imagine if something more serious had happened and how difficult it would be for policymakers in Washington to make the right decisions",
      " They will come under tremendous domestic political pressure to do things which may not be in the long term interest of the US",

      "Accidents can happen, which can rapidly become very serious",
      " It's important that both sides take a calm approach",
      " China can do this more easily because it has a centralized system although the Chinese leadership has to be mindful of the feelings of Chinese people",

      " The US knows that any promotion of \"Taiwan independence\" will lead to war",

      " That path is still there",
      "Singapore's position on the Taiwan question is very clear",
      " We have a one-China policy even before establishment of diplomatic relations with China in 1990",
      " We have close relations with China",
      " I don't think there should be any doubt about Singapore's position",

      "\" How do you understand the connotation of this concept? What's the significance of this idea for breaking the camp politics advocated by the US-led West?Yeo: It might take some time before the US and the collective West to accept China fully as an equal on the global stage",
      " The West has dominated the world for a very long time",
      " They believe that their values and their systems are the best for the entire world",
      " They assert their values as universal values",
      " They think their systems represent the highest achievement of human society",
      " So when China posits a different value system and a different political system, it is seen as a challenge to the West",
      " Many in the West think that when China becomes stronger and bigger, it will become aggressive the way they were",
      " I don't think they understand the nature of Chinese society",
      " I don't think they understand the history of Chinese civilization",
      " A lot of the people who express great fear of China and criticize China in very strong terms have a very shallow understanding of the Chinese people, of Chinese culture and civilization",
      "It would take a period of time before a new equilibrium is reached; there will be trials of strength before that happens",
      " China must at all points make sure that it doesn't show weakness",
      " But at the same time it should not show aggression",
      " It has to react, but it must be careful not to overreact",
      " China's response to Western pressure has to be carefully thought through taking into account the nature of Western society",
      " Maybe after some more years, a greater degree of acceptance of China's rise will be accepted in the West",

      " Photo: VCGEditor's Note:The Russia-Ukraine conflict is approaching its one-year mark, with no end in sight",
      " It is eating up scarce European resources, preventing millions of refugees from returning home and weakening the global economic outlook while the US and some European countries are fanning the flames of the war, keeping sending weapons to Ukraine",
      " How will the Russia-Ukraine conflict end? What are the biggest stumbling blocks for negotiation and diplomatic resolution?In an interview with Global Times, George Galloway (Galloway), six-term British parliamentarian, told Global Times (GT) reporter Li Aixin that a precondition to an end of conflict \"is not just that Ukraine will never apply to join NATO",
      " It's that NATO will never be in Ukraine, neither their weapons nor their personnel, nor their geostrategic worldview",
      "\"This is the first installment of the series",
      "George GallowayGT: Where do you think the conflict is headed in 2023?Galloway:I think the military, political situation in Ukraine has reached an important turning point",
      " It seems that some units are being withdrawn from the long battle in backward",
      " The rest, I presume, will follow",
      " If not, they'll be overrun by the Russian armed forces, possibly even in days, rather than weeks",
      " This has become a kind of Battle of Stalingrad, which 80 years ago was the turning point in the World War II",
      "The political situation will escalate further and faster on the back of the military defeat and strategic defeat",
      " There's already the replacement of the defense minister",
      " Unless the Ukrainians get a government that is free to negotiate an end to a political agreement, and an end to the conflict, the military situation will deteriorate very sharply and steeply for them over the next couple of months",
      "GT: What do you think will be the biggest stumbling block for negotiation and a diplomatic resolution of the conflict?Galloway: The West is ready to fight to the last drop of Ukrainian blood, but not their own",
      " The main stumbling block is getting higher every day",
      " If an agreement had been reached nine months ago, it would have been less costly to Ukraine than it is nine months later, and less than it will be 10, 12, or 15 months later",
      " So the prices are rising over a negotiated end",
      "But there are certain preconditions for Russia to stop fighting",
      " And one of those is not just that Ukraine never joins NATO",
      " Ukraine never did join NATO, but NATO joined it",
      " NATO was everywhere in Ukraine, even though Ukraine was not a member",
      " That's something that would have to be attended to in a diplomatic agreement",
      "So a precondition is not just that Ukraine will never apply to join NATO",
      " It's that NATO will never be in Ukraine, neither their weapons nor their personnel, nor their geostrategic world view",
      " The Ukraine would have to be a truly neutral state",
      " I don't think that's easy to envisage right now",
      " Apart from anything else, the West has given them hundreds of billions of dollars and will not just walk away from that investment",
      "GT: As you mentioned, the US-led NATO member states are continuously sending weapons to Ukraine, including, recently, battle tanks",
      " Some say the tanks could be a game changer",
      " Some call for offering even more advanced weapons to Ukraine",
      " How do you view those voices?Galloway: The tanks certainly will not [be a game changer]",
      " First of all, the American tanks, the Abrams tanks, didn't perform well either in Iraq or in Afghanistan, against insurgents or the improvised explosive devices by the side of the roads",
      " The version of the Abrams tanks that the US has agreed to give to Ukraine is a version stripped off its most important capability, which is armored capability",
      " They don't want to run the very high risk of this armor falling into Russian hands and being reversed, engineered with the secrets of the armor being obtained by Russia",
      "First of all, they are not proper Abrams tanks",
      " Secondly, they will not be there before the end of the year, maybe even next year",
      " And third, they are coming in insufficient numbers to make any kind of impact on the battlefield",
      " So this is all show",
      "The German Panzers, which have crossed the Ukrainian border to fight Russians before",
      " They are not coming in sufficient numbers either",
      " The Germans are half-hearted about it",
      " They have been forced, blackmailed even by their Western partners into allowing the supply of these weapons",
      "A few tanks here or there, even a couple of hundred tanks here or there, will not make any appreciable difference, but they will leave the NATO members virtually defenseless, having emptied their own inventories to supply Ukraine, which is using, but failing to replenish its material, at a quite extraordinary rate",
      "So it's a good thing that Russia has no intention of invading Western Europe, because if it did, it could be in Paris pretty damn quick because who, short of the use of nuclear weapons, is going to stop them? Luckily, I'm sure that's very far from the minds of the Russian leadership",
      " They just want not to have enemy missiles on their border",
      " That's why Ukraine will have to be completely demilitarized and properly neutralized before this conflict can end",
      "GT: In your show, you said, \"Not a single Member of Parliament, not one, challenges the line that we're on in this war",
      " There's a complete vacuum in politics",
      " This is unprecedented in parliamentary history",
      "\" What does it indicate?Galloway: I sat in the British parliament for almost 30 years, and my experience was that when parliament was unanimous, it was almost always unanimously wrong, on small matters",
      " It was never unanimous on the big matters",
      "Take the big issues on the Iraq war",
      " Hundreds of members of parliament opposed, in the voting lobbies, the invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq",
      " So, on big issues, this has never happened before, but it's happened now",
      "Not one single member of parliament out of 650 has opposed the NATO war in Ukraine",
      " That tells me that for all the trumpeting of democracy, free speech, freedom and liberty that the West does",
      " It does so in inverse proportion to the reality, the reality is that democracy, as they used to define it, is more or less dead in Western countries",
      "GT: Rob Bauer, chairman of NATO's Military Committee, recently said that the alliance is \"ready\" for a direct confrontation with Russia",
      " How likely do you think NATO would directly get involved in the conflict?Galloway: It's not remotely likely, except if they want to escalate to nuclear conflict",
      "NATO is entirely incapable of confronting Russia in a conventional war",
      " The British armed forces, who could all - army, navy and air force - fit into a football stadium, and not the biggest football stadium in England",
      " They have one day's ammunition, according to the Daily Mail newspaper",
      " They would quickly run out of ammunition",
      " They will run out of men",
      "They would not be able to sustain a conflict with Russia for even a single week, even if they were fighting with the butts of their right",
      " And Britain is the second most important military component of NATO, the US being the first",
      " But even the US has only 100,000 soldiers in Europe, it does not have the capacity to rapidly reinforce with well trained, well equipped forces",
      " That's a pretty poor, dead strength",
      "The other countries in NATO are paper tigers",
      " They are painted in military colors, but they have no military capability worth mentioning and no public support for military adventures",
      "If it goes nuclear, it's the end of the world",
      " And would their armed forces be prepared to do that? Would they overthrow their governments, if asked to do that? Would the public sit by while that became increasingly likely? These are all very big questions",
      "So my advice to the Chinese people and government is not to be afraid of this paper tiger",
      " They have never been weaker, and have never been more obvious that they are weak",
      "GT: With that being the case, can Europe's security still depend on NATO?Galloway: No, the only way that we can have a secure future is to have a security architecture which includes everybody, not one that is constructed against somebody",
      " If we take Russia",
      " Germany and Russia had very good relation in recent decades",
      " Germany was more than 50 percent dependent on very cheap and reliable Russian energy",
      " There was absolutely no need for any conflict between the two at all",
      "To be fair, both Angela Merkel and even Emmanuel Macron have repeatedly called for a security architecture that includes Russia",
      " But the Anglo-Saxon relationship, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US, and Britain, with the one or two other countries adding their eyes to the Five Eyes have never permitted, and now have destroyed any possibility of Russia-German, Russia-French partnership, either in the security field or any other field",
      " If we are to be secure, it can only be achieved by agreement, by negotiation, by something for everybody approach",
      "President Putin laid out what such architecture would look like, not yesterday, but long ago, in 2008 in Munich, in which he sketched what that security architecture could be and needed to be",
      " And the same is true with China",
      " What the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has to do with the Pacific Ocean, the South China Sea, the straits of Taiwan, is very difficult to see",
      " Unless the NATO countries basically overthrew their current system and became a militarized, a martial law society with the full militarization of their productive capacity, they are not in a position to fight either Russia or China still less both of them together",
      "GT: Against the backdrop, do you think an \"Asian NATO\" will come into being? NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg has recently visited South Korea and Japan, China was high on the agenda",
      " If NATO does expand to Asia-Pacific, what would it bring to Europe and the world?Galloway: NATO is really the US, so everything depends on what public support there is for war in the US",
      "From Donald Trump, we saw a very stridently hostile stand against the endless war, against NATO",
      " The next presidential elections are in 2024",
      " So, it is a distinct possibility that the US will elect a government that doesn't want to go further and further down this road",
      "But even if that's not the case, the US economy is so fragile",
      " The US productive capacity on the military industrial level is so severely stretched",
      " It's very unlikely that the US is in a position to fight a war in Asia",
      "And the rest are what I call Mussolinis",
      " Mussolini used to go around the world, threatening people with Hitler's army",
      " He didn't have an army of his own, but he could threaten them with Hitler's army",
      " And that's what others are doing",
      " Australia, for example, does Australia have an army? Can Australia fight China? No, it's an absurd proposition, but it can implicitly threaten China with US' army",
      " But what if US' army itself is not able to get involved in mega wars? We were not talking about a local skirmish",
      "Politically speaking, an Asian NATO is in the making, although I'm not sure South Korea was all that turned on by Stoltenberg's latest visit",
      " Not sure the South Korean people want to risk their prosperity by joining the war camp against China",
      "Japan is another thing",
      " We don't know to what extent the formerly savage, racist, rapacious Japanese expansionism is still present in the hearts and minds of the Japanese people",
      " That's why the attempts to dragoon Japan into an Asian NATO, confronting China are the most sinister of all",
      " And that's the one I'd be keeping my eyes on most sharply",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/Global TimesAccording to Sky News, Tobias Ellwood, the chair of UK's defense select committee, has suggested the AUKUS agreement, a trilateral agreement between Australia, the UK, and the US, expand to include India and Japan",
      " This is not the first-time news of the expansion of AUKUS has been reported",
      " Some Western media reports have previously hyped that Japan should join AUKUS",
      "In fact, AUKUS is laying the foundation for a new regional, or even global military alliance organization, intended to gradually develop into AUKUS Plus through continuous expansion, thus complementing the US global strategic focus to the east, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times",
      "According to observers, in the strategic planning of the US, the preferential partners to be drawn in are its military allies",
      " And now it is beginning to appeal to Japan and India",
      " This has extraordinary significance",
      "Although Japan is an ally of the US, it is different from other allies",
      " In a legal sense, Japan's ground forces are prohibited from operating overseas",
      " And for India, it has always adhered to an independent foreign policy",
      " Therefore, the consideration of roping in Japan and India to AUKUS marks the expansion of AUKUS not only in terms of the number of member states, but also in terms of structure, which is a new trend worthy of vigilance",
      "Such expansion could be just the beginning",
      " Starting from the US, the UK, and Australia as a core, with the continuous expansion of AUKUS to build the AUKUS Plus, in the future, there could be a new US alliance system that covers all corners of the Eastern, Western, Southern and Northern Hemisphere",
      "In the past, the US did not have a systematic military alliance in the Indo-Pacific region, but now it believes that the Indo-Pacific region will replace Europe as the new center of the world",
      " Thus, it will naturally establish military alliances to support its leadership position",
      " Whether it is AUKUS or the QUAD, its fundamental goal is to establish the leadership in this new world economic and political center, Yang told the Global Times",
      "In the construction of this new alliance system in the Asia-Pacific region, the biggest target is China",
      " In order to establish and consolidate its hegemonic position, all its constructions are aimed at suppressing and containing China",
      "Nevertheless, Washington's vision may not be realized smoothly",
      " A regional military alliance based on a confrontation-driven approach is toxic to the geopolitical security environment of the entire Asia-Pacific region",
      " Most regional countries are disgusted with the US' attempts to seek geo-hegemonic status and have made it clear that they will not take sides between the US and China",
      "Gao Jian, director of the Center for British Studies at Shanghai International Studies University pointed out that in terms of the development trend of the entire world today, the essence of future-oriented international relations should be based on equality, mutual benefit, cooperation and win-win results",
      " It is already an out-of-date political ideology to win over some regional countries to confront other major countries in the region, and to defend Western hegemony system dominated by the US on the grounds of ideology",
      "Such a cold war mentality and the hegemonic consciousness of the US and the West is destined to have no real space and market in the future framework of Asia-Pacific economic and political cooperation",
      " The world can see that China is a trustworthy, lovable and respectable image",
      " In the face of such a China, it is believed that the differences between the US and its allies on the issue of China must be greater than the common interests",

      " Cartoon: Carlos LatuffOne day ahead of the one yearanniversary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict's outbreak, a Chinese think tankpublished a report on Thursday, claiming that US aid to Ukraine is seriously \"watered-down\"as Kiev and Ukrainian people only received very little from the huge amount of theUS has promised, while the most of the assistance are actually serving the\"money laundering plan\" for the US military industrial complex",
      " The Chongyang Institute forFinancial Studies of Renmin University of China released the report \"AidMixed with Water: Inside Story and Analysis of Western Military Aid toUkraine\" at an academic forum held in Beijing on Thursday",
      " The reportshowed that, based on the data and documents published by Western governmentsand media since the very beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a largeamount of US aid funds has not flown to Kiev",
      "Over the past year, the US has continuedto provide and push its allies to provide military assistance to Ukraine, shapingan image of \"the champion of justice and a saver of Ukraine,\" said the report",
      " However,the fact is that Washington is using \"supporting Ukraine\" as a pretext to makehuge amount of taxpayers' money to transfer into the pocket of the US militaryindustrial giants like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies, while tens ofthousands of Ukrainian people are suffering from deadly military combat",
      "As of January 15, 2023, the totalamount of US pledged aid to Ukraine reached $76",
      "8 billion",
      " Among the pledgedassistance, military aid accounted for the largest proportion, at 46",
      "5 billionUS dollars, accounting for 61 percent",
      " Part of the US military aid is financialloans for the purchase of US military products",
      " This loan will form long-termliabilities for countries such as Ukraine, said the report",
      " However, humanitarian aid only accountedfor the smallest proportion, at $3",
      "9 billion, accounting for only 5 percent ofthe total amount",
      " Financial aid was $26",
      "4 billion, accounting for 34 percent",
      "The main purpose of US financial assistance is to maintain the continuity ofthe Ukrainian government's wartime operations",
      " According to the analysis of the report,its ultimate purpose is to \"prolong the Ukrainian crisis",
      "\"Although the US has spent hugeamount of money on military aid, Kiev's strength and capability for war havenot been significantly improved",
      " Only about 17 percent of the 2022 AdditionalUkraine Supplemental Appropriations Act involving $40 billion is directed toUkraine, and the rest of the money is suspected of being used for otherpurposes, said the report",
      " Among the $40 billion, more than $14",
      "2billion, accounting for about 36 percent, has been used for the US itself, suchas updating the US arsenals and ammunition, and issuing additional wages andallowances for US military personnel, said the report",
      " Another $18",
      "9 billion in aid fundsdid not specifically target recipient countries, accounting for about 47percent, so the public is unable to track where the money has gone",
      "The report summarized that: Firstly,the US aid is extremely inflammatory",
      " Before and during the crisis, the UScontinued to fuel the Ukrainian crisis with military aid and maintain itsintensity",
      " Secondly, the US aid is extremely deceptive",
      " The actual US aid toUkraine has shrunk layer by layer",
      " The delivery of aid is mainly\"dragging\"",
      " The delivery of the aid cannot be guaranteed",
      " Thirdly,the US aid is extremely self-serving",
      " A large proportion of the funds withinthe $40 billion aid bill to Ukraine will flow to the US itself, which willbring at least $17",
      "3 billion in additional revenue to US military contractors",
      "Fourthly, the US aid is extremely prone to causing further conflict, leading tomore serious internal conflicts in Europe, and European countries will have tostrengthen its dependence on the US in various fields such as energy, military,and economy",
      "Wang Wen, the executive dean of theChongyang Institute for Financial Studies, said at the forum that China standson the side of peace, and it's totally rightful and absolutely necessary for aChinese think tank to point out the fact and the dirty inside story ofso-called US or Western aid to Ukraine, to help more people to understand whythe conflict won't come to an end and who's been benefitting from the deadlycrisis",

      " Moreover, the document will inject much-needed sanity for the world's response on this crisis",
      "Noting that the one-year anniversary of the Ukraine crisis is days away, Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, announced at the 59th Munich Security Conference (MSC) that China will publish a document on its stance of finding a political settlement to the crisis",
      "Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said the document will reiterate Chinese President Xi Jinping's important propositions, which stress that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected, that the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be upheld, that the legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously, and that all efforts conducive to a peaceful resolution of the crisis should be supported",
      "In the document, China will reiterate that a nuclear war must never be fought and cannot be won, Wang said, adding that China also urges efforts to ensure the security of civil nuclear facilities, stands against attacking nuclear power plants, and will advocate joint efforts to oppose to the use of biochemical weapons",
      "The more complex the situation, the greater the need to remain cool-headed and pragmatic, Wang said, stressing that China is willing to join hands with all parties to continue the efforts for realizing peace at an early date",
      "The document will highlight China's active role in pushing for a peaceful settlement that hopefully will bring an end to the conflict which has been dragging on for a year, Wang Huiyao, president of nongovernment think tank the Center for China and Globalization, who is also attending the Munich Security Conference, told the Global Times",
      "Currently, it is difficult for all parties involved in the conflict to reach a consensus, but this conflict is wrecking havoc on the world, said Zhang Hong, an associate research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences",
      " He noted that China's proposals at the Munich Security Conference, as well as the about to be published document, tells the world that \"China has been actively seeking a solution for the crisis",
      " We are trying to bringing relevant parties to the negotiation table, and China is not sitting idle",
      "\"When meeting with Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba on Saturday, Wang Yi said that on the Ukraine issue, China always stands alongside peace and dialogue, and push for peace talks",
      " \"We don't want to see a prolonged and enlarged Ukraine crisis, and along with the international community, we're willing to prevent the situation from further escalating, Wang Yi noted, according to a readout released by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday",
      "It quoted Kuleba as saying that China and Ukraine have maintained communication the whole year, and Ukraine attaches great importance to China's international status and influence, takes seriously China's stance on solving the crisis via political ways, and is looking forward to China's constructive role",
      "Bringing sanity to chaosChina's proposal of a solution to the ongoing crisis has received positive feedback from some European countries",
      " German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock welcomed China's effort to use its influence to foster peace but told reporters she had \"talked intensively\" with Wang Yi during a bilateral meeting on Friday about \"what a just peace means: not rewarding the attacker, the aggressor, but standing up for international law and for those who have been attacked,\" according to media reports",
      "Speaking at the conference, Wang Yi said that the Ukraine crisis is not what China would like to see",
      " China is not a party directly involved, Wang said, noting that it did not choose to be a bystander or add fuel to the fire, still less exploit the crisis",
      "Wang Huiyao, who has met with people from European political think tanks, said that there's a growing concern in Europe about the consequences of the dragged conflicts, and would like to see the end of it",
      " \"Yet they [some Europeans] are not willing to sit down and talk, plus the US is backing the war to continue ",
      "",
      "",
      " Under such circumstance, China's proposal of peace talks is of much great importance",
      "\"French President Emmanuel Macron called at the conference on Friday for an \"intensification\" of Western support for Ukraine, but he also underscored that peace negotiations were the ultimate goal",
      " \"None of us will change geography\" and Russia is \"on European soil,\" he said",
      " Given that, \"we will have to negotiate",
      "\"Europe is now mired in an irrational hatred and antagonism against Russia, said Zhang, giving example that the Munich Security Conference is focused on Europe's security, yet it excluded Russia from participating",
      " \"Such mindset is hard to bring Russia to the negotiation table,\" he pointed out",
      "The West's supply of advanced weapons to Ukraine will inevitably provoke counterstrike from Russia, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times, noting that the Western squeeze may further pressure Russia to rapidly develop its weapons; \"then the war will never end, and the whole Europe will be engulfed by war",
      "\"Despite multiple rounds of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, the peace talks ended without any result",
      " \"We are not aware of the reasons behind it,\" Wang Yi said, adding that it seems some forces might not wish to see a successful peace talk or an end to the conflict",
      " Those forces \"do not care about the lives of the Ukraine people, nor the damage taken by Europe,\" Wang said, adding that, instead they have a larger strategic goal",
      "In contrast to China's promotion of a peaceful solution, the US is trying its utmost to fan flames of the conflict, and trying to use the conflict to drive a wedge between Beijing and Brussels",
      "Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, US Vice President Kamala Harris said that Russia has committed \"crimes against humanity\" during its nearly year-long conflict with Ukraine, and that Russia was now a \"weakened\" country after Biden led a coalition to punish it",
      " She also warned against Chinese support for Russia in the crisis with Ukraine",
      "In a statement published by the China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday briefing about the meeting between Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Wang said China has been sticking to the principle and push for peace talks on the Ukraine crisis",
      "Bilateral relations between China and Russia are within the sovereignty of two independent countries, and that we never accept US finger-pointing or pressure on China-Russia relation",
      " The US, as a big country, should rationally promote political solution of the crisis, not add fire to the fuel and seek benefits from the conflict, said Wang",
      "\"The US doesn't really care about if the crisis will be ended in peace or not",
      " It so badly wants Russia to lose that it doesn't care whether such wish will be at cost of Ukrainian people's lives,\" said Zhang, comparing the crisis to a wound on the arm, \"China's proposed solution is put some Chinese medicine to heal the bleeding wound, whilst the US wants to cut off the whole arm",

      "Carried out in an undisclosed airfield in the eastern part of East China's Zhejiang Province, the drills practiced the support exchange between the aviation forces of the Air Force and the Navy of the PLA Eastern Theater Command, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Monday",
      "In the morning, several Su-30 fighter jets attached to a brigade of the aviation force of the Navy took off and headed toward a training area, shortly before several warplanes of the same type from the Air Force that had just finished training landed one by one, CCTV reported",
      "The Air Force's Su-30s then entered hangars as ground maintenance staff members wearing Navy badges carried out checks and maintenance for them, according to the report",
      "\"In routine support exchange of the same type of aircraft, our maintenance staff must work fast with excellence and precision,\" Captain Ma Xiyue, a deputy commander of the naval aviation force brigade, told CCTV",
      "\"Only then can we shorten the preparation time for the next round of aircraft sorties, improve efficiency for readying warplanes and win advantages on the battlefield,\" Ma said",

      "With more airfields available to choose from for both services, this will increase tactical and operative flexibility, bringing about advantages in combat, the expert said",

      " File photo: AFPAlthough it is uncertain how this will help the Ukrainian army to improve its combat capabilities, the announcement by the US and Germany that they will provide Ukraine with offensive tanks will undoubtedly drag Russia and Ukraine into a quagmire, pushing the end of this conflict further away",
      "US President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday that his administration will provide Ukraine with 31 US-made M1 Abrams tanks, which Russia has said would be its target if they were to be used in the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev",
      "Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced its government's decision of providing Germany's Leopard 2 tanks as a part of its effort to strengthen German military support for Ukraine",
      "Following the US and Germany, more allies are expected to join",
      " Poland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Finland are among the list",
      " In total, Ukraine's European allies would send about 80 tank vehicles to the frontline, Politico reported on Wednesday night",
      "The move worsened the already complex situation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine",
      "At a press briefing in Moscow on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov blamed Western countries of sending tanks to Ukraine, saying that there are no prospects for the resumption of Russia-Ukraine peace talks",
      " Peskov noted that if Abrams tanks are delivered to Ukraine, they \"will burn like all other tanks,\" but as they are expensive, the European taxpayers will bear the financial burden while \"Americans, as always, will remain at least with their own, and most likely - with good profits",
      "\"Chinese analysts noted that even though it is not sure if the Ukrainian troops could handle the advanced aggressive weapons provided by its Western allies, the current situation is \"not positive",
      "\"Analysts warn that the actions of Western countries further interfering in the conflict will intensify and even lead the current Russia-Ukraine conflict to reach an \"unimaginable level of confrontation",
      "\"A tricky deedFrom defensive arms to aggressive tanks, the West has gradually increased its military assistance to Ukraine",
      " However, questions remain about how the tanks will help Ukrainian troops and influence the course of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, analysts noted",
      "\"Now the conflict between Ukraine and Russia is mainly on land, so the main performance on the battlefield depends mainly on the quality and capability of weapons and soldiers",
      " At present, Ukraine is obviously in a passive role,\" Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "\"Russia has strong land combat capabilities, while the US and Germany want to improve Ukraine's military capabilities by providing main battle tanks to Ukraine,\" he said",
      " \"These land warfare weapons will undoubtedly enhance Ukraine's military strength, but on the battlefield, many factors will play a role, including military strategic deployment and the quality of soldiers",
      "\"An anonymous military source observed that \"Ukraine is using weapons and equipment temporarily supported by various countries and may face problems of insufficient personnel training and insufficient logistical support",
      "\"The M1 Abrams' \"complex electronic components and especially their gas turbine propulsion systems\" could make them particularly difficult to operate and maintain, according to The Warzone, a defense-analysis website",
      " \"In other words, the US can't just send its M1s to Ukraine,\" the website said",
      "Moreover, the tanks provided by the US and Germany are all heavy-duty main battle tanks, which operate fine in winter",
      " But in spring and summer when the roads become muddy, the tanks' performance would be affected, the military analyst said",
      " \"By contrast, Russia's T72 and T90 tanks, which are lighter, have stronger mobility",
      "\"\"At this stage, the supply of weapons (air defense systems, heavy tanks, small and medium-range missiles) will help the Ukrainian army to hold the front and prolong the conflict, increasing the losses on both sides,\" Sergey Biryukov, a professor at the Siberian Institute of Management in Novosibirsk of Russia, told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "However, Biryukov believed that tanks provided by the US and NATO countries are \"still insufficient for the spring offensive\" for Ukraine",
      "At the same time, the provision of long-range missiles and combat aircraft manufactured by NATO countries to Ukraine may contribute to a significant escalation of the situation; nevertheless, I believe that such a delivery is unlikely to take place in the near future, Biryukov said",

      " There is something terrifying about cornering a nuclear power, analysts noted",
      "After Biden and Scholz's announcement, the responses from Russia and the analyses of military and international relations experts suggested that the tanks will lead to a further counterattack against Russia, making the end of the conflict more unpredictable",
      "Russia's ambassador to Germany Sergey Nechaev condemned Germany's decision to send tanks to support Ukrainian defenses, saying it is \"extremely dangerous\" and will push the war to a \"new level of confrontation",
      "\"Russia's Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said on Wednesday that any delivery of American tanks to Ukraine would be seen as \"another blatant provocation\" by the West",
      "\"If the US decide to supply tanks, it will be impossible to justify such step using arguments about 'defensive weapons,'\" the envoy said",
      " \"This would be another blatant provocation against the Russian Federation",
      "\"On Thursday, Russia fired dozens of missiles toward Ukraine",
      " Ukrainian military spokesman Yuriy Ignat said that \"We expect more than 30 missiles, which have already started to appear in various territories",
      " Air defense systems are operational,\" AFP reported",
      "\"The escalation of the conflict can be ensured by the West supplying Ukraine with long-range missiles and combat aircraft in significant quantities, as well as the deployment of NATO military infrastructure in Ukraine without the official involvement of the North Atlantic Alliance in the conflict,\" Professor Biryukov said, adding that Poland or Romania, as the \"juniors\" of NATO, joining the conflict officially may also trigger the escalation",
      "At the same time, it should be recognized that the line between escalation and the \"normal\" course of the military conflict in Ukraine is quite thin and conditional, he said",
      "Biryukov believes that only a serious military conflict in another region of the world, a sharp increase in the economic crisis in Western countries, or the large-scale destabilization of the existing political regime in Ukraine due to internal factors, may distract the US and NATO from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and ease the current tension",
      "\"Reaching a strategic agreement between Russia and Western countries on de-escalation and ending the conflict seems unlikely today,\" he noted",

      " The two countries announced a deal on February 2 that will give US troops access to another four bases in the Southeast Asian country",
      " Photo: AFPThe US has been criticized for pushing for more military presence in Asia out of a zero-sum game mentality and jeopardizing regional stability, after the US has managed to expand access to four additional military bases in the Philippines to boost its military flexibility in possible war scenarios with China",
      "Analysts said that regional countries have become vigilant about not becoming cannon fodder for Washington's belligerence",
      "Despite protests scattered around cities in the Philippines, including Manila and Quezon City, against the deployment of US forces and weapons in the country, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin pressed on with advancing the expansion of a defense pact, which allows the US to position military equipment and rotate its troops to four more military bases in the Southeast Asian country",
      "The deal under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) was announced on Thursday",
      " Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who took office last year, also met with Austin on Thursday",
      "The US and some Western media ran a series of reports on the deal before it was finalized and claimed that this US military expansion was aimed at China's \"increasing\" threats inthe South China Sea and the Taiwan question",
      "In response, Mao Ning, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told a routine press conference on Thursday that defense and security cooperation between countries needs to be conducive to regional peace and stability and not targeted at or harmful to the interests of any third party",
      " The US, out of selfish interests, holds on to the zero-sum mentality and keeps strengthening military deployment in the Asia-Pacific",
      " This would escalate tensions and endanger peace and stability in the region",
      "Mao also reminded that regional countries need to remain vigilant and avoid being coerced or used by the US",
      "The Chinese Embassy in the Philippines alsoresponded on Thursday, saying that during his visit, Austin smeared China over the South China Sea and pushed the US' anti-China agenda, which goes against regional countries' common aspiration for peace, cooperation, and development",
      " It also runs counter to Filipino people's common desire to accelerate economic recovery, improve people's livelihoods and develop cooperation with China",
      "From a military tactical point of view, the US military's access to more bases in the Philippines will grant US forces more flexibility if a conflict breaks out between China and the US over the Taiwan question or in the South China Sea, but that will not change the Chinese military forces' superiority on its doorstep along the first island chain, military analysts said",
      "From locations in the Philippines such as Luzon and Palawan islands, the US military could cover the Bashi Channel to the south of the island of Taiwan and the Nansha Islands in the South China Sea, so it is likely the US will deploy surveillance, reconnaissance and combat forces in the newly announced bases, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "With the modernization and rapid development of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) over the past decade, the US has acknowledged that the Philippines, together with other locations along the first island chain, is no longer secure",
      " This is why it has been pulling back some of its forces to the second island chain, while also scattering its forces to more locations, making it more difficult for the PLA to strike them, experts said",
      "Under this concept, the US did not aim to increase the number of troops in the Philippines, but sought to have more bases at its disposal, said Chinese military expert Zhang Xuefeng",
      "Zhang told the Global Times on Thursday that the US now wants to deploy small but mobile forces in the first island chain that are able to harass the PLA, making it more difficult for the PLA to break the chain",
      "However, these US forces are actually putting themselves in a dangerous position, as PLA's tactical missiles and aviation forces can easily cover them with large numbers of munitions, Zhang said",
      "To counter the latest US move, the PLA should act to prepare more cost-efficient precision munitions and their launch platforms, in addition to increasing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets that can track, monitor and lock onto US' flexible deployment in real time, observers said",
      "Song said that if a conflict breaks out, all US bases involved in attacking China will be targeted by the PLA, and the countries that host those US bases will inevitably get hit",
      "The Philippines should not get itself involved in the confrontation between China and the US, but instead focus on domestic economic development and make joint efforts to make the South China Sea a sea of peace and stability, Song said",
      "Although the permission to use additional bases in the Philippines is more symbolic than practical, the US will trumpet it as a major achievement for pushing its Indo-Pacific Strategy, some analysts said",
      " As predicted, a release from the US Defense Department hailed the \"full implementation\" of the EDCA and boasted it as being \"a key pillar of the US-Philippines alliance",
      "\"The government of the Philippines has acted with more prudence on the deal to avoid casting a shadow over China-Philippines or China-ASEAN relations, as both the Philippines and ASEAN members have managed to maintain a delicate balance between China and the US, Zhou Fangyin, a research fellow at the Guangdong Institute for International Strategies, told the Global Times",
      "The Biden administration is keen to fix its relations with the Philippines, which became strained under ex-president Rodrigo Duterte",

      " However, analysts said that the Philippine president is endeavoring to balance security and military with economic development, and has shown a positive attitude in handling disputes with China on the South China Sea",
      "As the US persists in fanning confrontations to contain China, regional countries are encouraged to increase their vigilance for any attempt to destroy the hard-won peace and stability in the region, said analysts",

      " This shows that there are serious loopholes in the infrastructure construction and transportation management of dangerous goods in the US, and the safety of a large number of American residents is thus threatened",
      " This is also a sign of the lack of governance within the US",

      " Once it enters the soil or water, it will cause greater and long-term harm",
      " Under natural conditions, it will take at least more than ten years or twenty years to decompose",
      " Without timely human intervention, the local population will be at risk of developing cancer within many years",
      " A chemical expert told the Global Times that the industry has relatively mature contingency plans for vinyl chloride leaks or explosions, but they don't know why the US' handling is so unscientific this time",
      " He believes that it is not because the US is incapable, but that it's unwilling",
      "The US federal government has a number of specialized functional departments, each of which is supposed to have its own job, but now they seem to be encapsulated in the same cage called \"national security",
      "\" It has spared no effort to \"prevent threats",
      "\" Come and see, there are balloons in the sky, \"they came from China,\" we shot them down, it seems to be very hilarious and refreshing, but will the polluted air get better? Have the soil and water been disinfected? No matter how ideologically paranoid Americans are, they also know that hyping the \"China threat theory\" cannot solve the real environmental security problems facing the American people",
      " On February 13, when US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg attended an event, he didn't mention the train derailment accident, but made a clumsy joke of \"spy balloon,\" which caused a crusade",
      " It seems that the usual tactics of Washington politicians to deflect conflicts are no longer effective",
      "To some extent, the poor response of the US to the train derailment accident in Ohio was inevitable",
      " It is a reminder that the threat to America is not external, but internal",
      " When \"national security\" overshadows the operation mechanism of the whole state power, the safety limit of the public is repeatedly lowered",
      " The incident also serves as a wake-up call to the US political elite: it is their business to focus on internal governance, which is also the right way to build a \"great America",
      "\" If the security concept is not \"on track,\" its domestic security problems will continue to erupt",
      " Who can guarantee that the next American danger will not hit the whole world? "

      " South China Sea Illustration: Chen Xia/GTASEAN chair Indonesia said on Saturday that Jakarta proposed an \"implementation plan\" for ASEAN members to resume negotiations for the Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea",
      " Indonesia is preparing to host a round of negotiations on the COC this year, the first taking place in March, said Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi",
      "The situation in the South China Sea remains stable, the COC consultation process has gradually returned to the track of face-to-face meetings since last year, and the second reading of the draft negotiating text of the COC has accelerated",
      " This helps China and ASEAN members to enhance trust, build consensus, and achieve the goal of managing crises, preventing conflicts and deepening practical maritime cooperation through the establishment of rules and regulations at an early date",
      "Today, triggers affecting the situation of the South China Sea are explicit",
      " The Indo-Pacific Strategy promoted by the US creates regional division and confrontation, attempting to establish a small multilateral security mechanism against China",
      " As a result, the anxiety of some neighboring countries surrounding the South China Sea issue has increased",
      "Although ASEAN members are always vigilant to avoid getting involved in major power confrontations, the Cold War mentality of some powers outside the region led by the US has intensified geopolitical competition in the South China Sea, which has to a certain extent distracted and reduced the attention of regional countries on cooperation in non-traditional security fields",
      " A few ASEAN members' will to speed up the COC consultation has waned, trying to further solidify their illegal gains on controversial issues by extending the \"window period\" before the COC is reached",
      " Divergence among parties on matters such as binding force, and enforcement mechanisms has brought difficulties to the conclusion of the COC",
      "Despite differences, consultation is a process of seeking common ground while reserving divergences and expanding consensus",
      " ASEAN has regarded the South China Sea issue as leverage for sustaining its own unity, defending regional stability, and maintaining balance between major powers in recent years",
      " On the other hand, there are still different views and agendas within ASEAN regarding the COC consultations, as well as on how and what role non-regional countries should play and how ASEAN's own interests should be protected",
      " These differences not only have an impact on the progress of the COC consultation, but also on the substantive content and implementation effects of the code",
      "As the development of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, the COC consultation is an effort and attempt by China and ASEAN members to explore and build a regional order before the settlement of relevant disputes in the South China Sea, and it is also of practice of international law and international relations practice of pioneering significance",
      "Although the COC will not address all the problems in the South China Sea, it is complementary to the declaration in crisis management and control",
      " More than 20 years ago, the declaration set the formulation of a code as a long-term goal, which is to ensure that the South China Sea will become a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation through more substantive and effective regional rules",
      "There are both positive and negative factors influencing the situation in the South China Sea",
      " It is the joint responsibility of China and ASEAN members to prevent the South China Sea issue from spiraling out of control via rule building",
      " It has been proven that China has played a critical role in properly handling disputes in the South China Sea and maintaining regional peace and stability",
      " The \"dual-track approach\" that China and ASEAN members have pursued and produced positive results should also be adhered to",
      "In the future, ASEAN members and China should meet each other halfway, manage and properly handle disputes in the South China Sea, continue to deepen functional maritime cooperation under the guidance of open regionalism, enhance the convergence of interests through more diverse, concrete and exemplary maritime cooperation projects, and reduce the negative impact of geopolitical factors through goodwill, common vision and successful practices of regional maritime governance cooperation",
      "Over the years, the COC consultations have achieved a series of phased results",
      " Although the process has been delayed due to some factors, it has sustained positive momentum",
      " We can draw an important revelation by the history and reality of the establishment of South China Sea rules: the primary beneficiaries of the South China Sea's tranquility are regional countries, and the bitter fruit of South China Sea turmoil will also be mainly bored by regional countries",
      " These countries should firmly hold the key to solving problems in their own hands, accommodate each other's concerns, and prevent external interference and mutual differences from blocking the pace of deepening cooperation and building consensus",
      " In this way, it will be a matter of course to reach an effective code that complies with international law",

      " Xinhua file photos of Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) and US President Joe Biden (right)Editor's Note:As the first anniversary of the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict approaches, Russian and US leaders have recently taken measures to boost the morale of the two sides at war",
      " In particular, Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden both delivered a speech regarding the ongoing conflict on Tuesday",
      " What are the messages behind the addresses, especially Putin's? Will they affect the development of the war? How does Russia interpret Biden's recent trip to Ukraine and Poland? The Global Times talked with two Russian experts about their perspectives on these issues",
      "Sergey Biryukov, a professor at the Siberian Institute of Management in Novosibirsk of RussiaIn his Tuesday speech, Putin doubled down on his criticisms of the West and justified the need for a Special Military Operation precisely by highlighting the aggressive and threatening behavior of Western countries toward Russia for many years",
      " Russia's military operation, in accordance with the logic of the Russian president, aimed to disrupt these plans by the West",
      "Russia, having made groundless concessions and rapprochement with the West in the 1990s, and demonstrating its commitment to dialogue with it in subsequent years, not only did not find an adequate perception of its position, but almost fell into the \"confrontation trap\" skillfully constructed by the West - which required extraordinary actions in order to avoid",
      "Putin's main message to the world community is the question of the historical responsibility of the West for the actual breakdown of the balance of power in world politics and the destruction of the system of international relations that has been formed for many decades",
      " Ukraine, according to the head of the Russian state, has become hostage to the irresponsible political game of the West",
      "Joe Biden and the segment of the American and global elite behind him support the conflict with Russia in an acute phase and even seek to aggravate it in order to continue forming a new global coalition around the US, including non-Western countries that are hesitating today",
      " At the same time, Biden needs to justify the previous large-scale assistance to Ukraine by referring to the allegedly growing threat from Russia against a number of societies and countries",
      " The US president has chosen injection technology, and the way of such injection is his demonstrative trip to Kiev and Warsaw, designed to attract the attention of voters of the US Democratic Party and representatives of the world community oriented to American \"Democrats",
      "\"Vladimir Pavlenko, a research fellow at the Moscow-based independent public scientific organization Academy of Geopolitical ProblemsPutin's message is a response to the anti-Russian statements at the Munich Security Conference",
      " The Russian president pointed out that the US and the West deliberately unleashed hostilities, using the Minsk agreements to buy time and arm Ukraine",
      " Washington and other Western countries are not hiding it, but bragging about it",
      "Putin recalled in the address that at the end of 2021, Russia sent the West comprehensive proposals for an equitable system of collective security, including drafts of relevant treaties",
      " The West rejected the Russian initiative, and it became clear that the five-time expansion of NATO was a deliberate policy to achieve a decisive geopolitical advantage over Russia and to inflict a strategic defeat on us",
      "Russia is using force forcibly to stop the war unleashed by the West",
      " Since the creation of a centralized Russian state, the West has perceived Moscow as an opponent and has repeatedly invaded to try to destroy us",
      " In the 30 years after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Western countries have been trying to turn Ukraine into an \"anti-Russian\" bulwark and use it as a battering ram against our country",
      "Despite the historical lessons, such a view continues to be heard in certain Western circles: It is in the interests of the West to separate a number of Russian territories from the country, to create puppet states on them, while organizing a \"color revolution\" in our own country",
      " Today we have every opportunity to break this vicious circle of history, providing sovereignty - if not forever, then for a very long time",
      "Russia's opponents in this conflict are actively taking advantage of the first anniversary of the Special Military Operation, including US President Joe Biden's trip to Kiev and Warsaw",
      " In his speech in Poland, Biden responded to Putin's decision to suspend Russia's participation in the New START Treaty, which expires in 2026, something the US was clearly counting on",
      "The US president planned his trip expecting to outplay Russia, presenting himself to the world public as a \"hero on the front lines",
      "\" And now Biden's visit to Ukraine and Poland has become the backdrop for a Russian initiative that completely changes the situation and balance in the world",
      " Putin's decision will deprive the US of treaty guarantees in the field of strategic security - In this area, the US is currently most vulnerable, as for certain reasons, it is significantly behind Russia",

      "Photo: ICDear Matthew and Sophia,I am so glad to hear from you",
      " Three difficult years have passed since you departed on that beauteous summer",
      " I heard you have already embarked on a brand-new journey in university",
      " Congratulations! It's so momentous a leap for us Chinese students, and I guess it also means a lot for you in America",
      " Indeed, our nations have many things in common, as we both believe in the value of family bonds, patriotism, and so forth",
      " However, in recent years, our countries have become unprecedentedly distanced",
      " Against such a backdrop, it is reasonable that you have posed all those questions in your letter, and I'm more than willing to offer you my perspective",
      " Let's chat like we used to do during the summer camp, where we met as campers and TA without finger-pointing",
      "Matthew asked how China can deem it democratic when its people are not endowed with the right to vote for their leader",
      "To start with, Matthew, we do vote for our leader",
      " It may puzzle you as we don't vote in the same way as you do",
      " In China, we do not vote directly for the president; instead, we first select National People's Congress (NPC) deputies (similar to the members of your congress but not the same), and the deputies will vote, on behalf of the people, for our president",
      " (A little bit like your Electoral College system)However, although I'm proving that we also vote, I want to stress more: Maybe we should not define democracy so narrowly",
      " Perhaps it's time for us to get rid of the obsolete dogma and see that the core of democracy should be the actualization of human dignity, instead of focusing on the tool of the vote alone",
      "What we Chinese uphold is the whole-process people's democracy",
      " For instance, not only in the presidential election, but Chinese people are also fully involved in legislation",
      " In October, an amendment to the Law on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women was adopted after learning from an avalanche of suggestions",
      " You could see heated discussions at every corner of the Internet during the proposal period",
      " And not only that, we have communities functioning as fundamental self-governance units and political consultative conference that equips our government with know-how from the people with professional skills",
      "",
      "",
      " Vote matters, but it's not everything",
      "Sophia asked why we Chinese people do not understand the value of freedom and are always willing to abide by so many rules",
      "You might have heard of this - \"Oh liberty, what crimes are committed in thy name\" - uttered by Madame Roland before placing her head on the guillotine, which neatly manifests the dichotomy of liberty or freedom",
      "And you might have guessed what I will draw upon as an example - the guns",
      " China has a ban on guns and deems them a threat to social stability and people's lives, while American people regard guns as insurance for their freedom and safety",
      " I pay respect to the ideal of the US founding fathers despite our diametrically opposed ideas on this issue",
      " Their ideal was, to be honest, marvelous but, at the same time, unrealistic",
      " That's understandable, as they can't foresee the extremely speedy evolution of guns and the deterioration of social ethics",
      "Rules shield our freedom",
      " Please tell me, how can people enjoy freedom when their lives have been brought to a sudden end? Matthew, Sophia, whenever I saw the news about gun violence in New York, your city, I would worry about you",
      " How I wish that we could continue writing to each other even when our skin wrinkles",
      " To make that come true, it may be time to find a way to renew people's perception of freedom",
      "You asked this question together: \"Why do we Chinese support, to quote you, the communist authoritarian government so dearly?\"You proposed the last question together since you thought it was harsh and may \"annoy\" me, I guess",
      " NOT AT ALL! Anyone from China can tell you how strong the bonds between our Party and the people are",
      " No kidding",
      "Frankly speaking, we don't deem it fair to label the Chinese government as \"authoritarian",
      "\" The true tyrannical dynasty, in which people were exploited by the \"civilized\" noblemen and \"charitable\" landlords, was exactly overthrown by the people led by the Communist Party of China (CPC)",
      " For the first time, we, the people, can master our destiny and country",
      "Matthew, do you remember that you spilled a whole bottle of coke over your bed and slept together with Thomas the first night on our campus? There's also a true story about quilt-sharing in the CPC history",
      "During the Long March, three female Red Army soldiers slept with Xu, a destitute local villager, in her hut",
      " Seeing that Xu's quilt was too thin to keep a person warm, the soldiers cut off half of the only quilt they owned and gave it to Xu when leaving",
      " That's only one epitome of the bonds between the CPC and the Chinese people",
      " Now, the answer is obvious - How can our people begrudge supporting and backing the Party that was born out of themselves and would always be ready to share half of its quilt even though it owns only one?At the end of the letter, I'd like to quote a poem by Robert Frost, my favorite poet, and recompose some details of it:Some say the world will end in fireSome say in iceFrom what I've known about warsI hold with those who favor fireBut if it had to perish twiceI think I know enough of hateTo say that for destruction iceis also greatAnd would sufficeSome people worry about a throat-cutting hot war between China and the US, which will absolutely lead to calamity and ruin",
      " However, in my perspective, it is the looming danger of skyrocketing hate and misconception between the two nations that deserves more attention now",
      " Just like we should not ignore the destructive power of ice in the poem, we should not ignore the potentially damaging nature of hate and misconception, which are the breeding ground of all evil",

      " \"US-style democracy,\" which has long been used by the US as a weapon to instigate conflicts, has increasingly incurred alarm in the world, while the banner of ideology can no longer hide the true color of hegemony, bullying and high-handedness",
      "What happened in Syria in the past two days is a very illustrative example",
      " Syria, which has experienced years of war and turmoil, was hit by a strong earthquake, and people had to dig through the ruins with their bare hands due to a lack of needed equipment and supplies",
      " To add insult to injury, US sanctions have severely hindered the delivery of humanitarian aid, such as medicine, to Syria",
      " Facing calls from the international community to lift sanctions, Washington at first rejected this humanitarian request by using the \"democracy vs autocracy\" rhetoric",
      " Later, due to increasing pressure from global public opinion, it reluctantly agreed to relax some sanctions against Syria",
      " This shift proves the hypocrisy of the US' so-called narrative of democracy",
      " In fact, it was under the guise of \"democracy\" that Washington forcefully interfered in Syria's internal affairs, leading to the constant war and economic devastation in the country",
      " To this day, the US military still occupies those areas in Syria where the main oil fields are located, plundering more than 80 percent of the country's oil production and smuggling and burning Syrian food stocks",
      " This is a true reflection of \"US-style democracy",
      "\"However, Syria is not the only example",
      " It is almost an iron law that wherever Washington peddles \"democracy,\" there is no peace",
      " The Monroe Doctrine still haunts Latin America; the war caused by NATO's eastward expansion is still going on in Europe; years of war have led to huge humanitarian crises in the Middle East; Washington has been inciting an arms race and bloc confrontation in the name of democracy in the Asia-Pacific",
      " These practices have resulted in not only concerns from the international community, but also reflection within the US",

      " Now, the \"defense of democracy\" has further become the main grip of US foreign policy, obstructing and destroying the democratization of international relations",

      " Photo: Sputnik / Maxim BogodvidThe Western price cap on Russian oil as well as Moscow's retaliatory ban on oil supplies to countries that adopted it will not be as significant for global oil markets as the potential recession crisis or other issues with global supply, experts told Sputnik",
      "The countries that have imposed the cap restrict maritime shipping of Russian crude oil to third countries, leveraging their influence in maritime transport to reduce the amount that Russia can charge countries that still rely on its energy exports",
      " Russian oil purchased above the price ceiling cannot be shipped or insured by EU and G7 operators, while transactions involving such oil also cannot be financed",
      "In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin on December 27 signed a decree banning supplies of Russian oil and petroleum products if contracts directly or indirectly provide for a price cap",
      "This development came as no surprise since Moscow had made it clear from the very beginning that it wouldn't comply with the price cap",
      " As Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov had said previously, the country would look for new markets and logistics even at higher costs",
      "\"I was not at all surprised to hear that products subject to a price cap from some buyers would not be supplied to those buyers and the seller would instead seek to find a different buyer who was prepared to deviate from the cap",
      " That is what we would expect in a market with many buyers and many sellers,\" Peter Hartley, the George A",
      " Peterkin professor of economics at Rice University, said",
      "He suggested that if buyers face penalties for purchasing oil above the cap, it is possible that they could get it at a discount, i",
      "e",
      " below the world price, and thus still profit by selling refined products at market prices",
      " At the same time, while Russia could potentially benefit from its recent decision, it could also face negative consequences",
      "\"If the refinery buying the Russian crude is not suited for it, and if the transportation to that refinery is much more expensive, it is possible that the ban could mean Russia ends up with a lower price than it would get by selling its crude to a usual buyer at the capped price",
      " So, it is not all that obvious how it would go - one would need to study where Russian crude was being sold before relative to now, how the market gets re-shuffled, etc",
      ",\" Hartley noted",
      "Meanwhile, Jacques Sapir, professor and director of studies at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, expressed his doubt that the caps will limit Russia's export earnings as the Russian government announced plans to cut oil production by up to 7%",
      "\"In theory, this is sufficient to push prices well above the ceilings",
      " Even if the EU and the United States disappear as potential customers of Russian oil and gas, the rest of the world will create demand,\" Sapir explained, adding that \"if demand remains higher than supply, Russia will easily find new markets where it can export its hydrocarbons and the rise in prices will compensate for reduced production, implying that export revenues will remain at their second-half level",
      "\"The real question, according to the expert, is whether prices in other markets, such as India and China, would be enough to offset the drop in production",
      "GLOBAL MARKETSYet another important matter is how the price cap and Putin's decision will affect the global energy markets in general",
      "Hartley pointed to differences between oil refining facilities all over the globe that are tuned to refine different grades of oil, suggesting a possible reshuffling of buyers and sellers that could lead to a short-term mismatch between refineries and the oil they receive",
      "\"This can alter the relative prices of different grades of crude and is likely, in general, to lead to a bigger gap between product prices and crude prices as the refinery sector operates less efficiently",
      " Those price gaps then incentivize investments that will in the longer run lead to a better match of capital to its use,\" Hartley explained",
      "Ehud Ronn, professor of finance at the McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin, thinks that the effect of Moscow's decision on oil prices will be minimal",
      "\"The Russian Federation is already selling oil to several contractors - China and India, in particular - at a significant price discount",
      " With global oil prices at the $80 range, the cap of $60 may not be significantly binding,\" Ronn said",
      "While there was a $1",
      "60, or 1",
      "9%, increase on December 27, the exact reason for it was unclear and the overall impact was minimal, he argued",
      "Moreover, as a rule, the oil market is subject to two types of crises related to supply and demand, Ronn said, adding that this year both were in play",
      "\"A supply-side crisis began in Europe on Feb",
      " 24th and appeared somewhat to subside (only in the oil markets) on or about June 15",
      " The U",
      " S",
      " Federal Reserve Board's increase in rates on March 16 augured a potential demand-side (recession) crisis",
      " Excepting seven days at the end of Oct",
      " 2022, the demand-side has had the greater impact over the latter part of 2022,\" Ronn said",
      "Sapir, for his part, warned that if countries deemed hostile by Russia suffer a major recession next year, this could create a drop in prices that will be addressed by Russia's partners, including Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries, by cutting production in order to balance the supply/demand ratio",
      " He suggested that oil-producing countries have amassed enough money in 2022 to be able to weather major cuts if necessary",
      "\"In general, we see that it is not the price 'ceilings' that represent the really significant variable on the hydrocarbon markets",
      " The two main variables, which are at the same time unknowns, are the amount of global demand for hydrocarbons (and therefore the extent of the recession to come) and the amount of global supply (in other words the impact of production cuts implemented by Russia, as well as by the OPEC countries),\" Sapir concluded",
      "Western countries have been seeking ways to limit Russia's income from oil and gas exports, as well as their dependence on Russian fuel since the country launched a military operation in Ukraine on February 24",
      " On December 5, the European Union placed a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russian crude oil, and was joined by the G7 nations and Australia",
      " The EU sanctions provide for a price ceiling on Russian refined products starting from February 5, 2023",

      "US Air Force reportedly shot down a Chinese company's project to build giant corn mill less than 15 miles from their North Dakota base",
      " China expert Michael Pillsbury on Monday went hysterical, issuing an urgent warning on \"Mornings with Maria\" of the Fox Business, for legal action to be taken against the Communist Party of China as concerns for national security swell, \"it's a very important subject and it's a good example of a larger problem,\" he exaggerated",
      "This is the anti-China hysteria of the new era",
      " This kind of rhetoric has appeared before",
      " In different phases, fear, exclusion, and racial discrimination targeting China or Chinese Americans have been nothing new",
      " Now that such incidents have taken place in states such as Texas and Florida",
      "Recently, anti-China atmosphere or sentiment in the US has been increasingly rampant",
      " In this context, politicians in states, especially red ones, will make every endeavor to exploit China-related issues to score political points, and to set up their labels as hawks on China in politics or policies",
      " However, for Washington, prohibiting people with ties to China from purchasing property will evidently not help solve the current security or social problems facing the US",
      " Instead, it will aggravate them",
      "It will trigger a direct impact on widening the rift in the US society, especially for Chinese Americans",
      " They will doubt whether they can still live in the US legally, with security, safety and dignity, and their confidence in the US federal institutions will be impaired",
      " In a short, it is not conducive to the US' social stability",
      "Furthermore, it is absurd to hype that Chinese's purchase of property and land in the US poses a security threat to Washington, at odds with US claims of protecting free trade of property and land as well as the spirit of openness the country promotes",
      " The prevailing of such illogical accusations in the US indicates that against the backdrop in which anti-China is politically correct, any issue that involves China, could lose its inherent logic",
      " And what matters more is how to use this issue to attack China",
      "Under the pretext of national security and ideology, Washington is attempting to provoke confrontation with China, and ramp up its suppression of China, ignoring various market principles and retreating to the old path of trade protectionism",
      " As for Chinese companies, the US is indeed not the most ideal destination, particularly because the US government uses political and security reasons at every turn to restrict China's investment in the US by administrative means and the US' local governments are also practicing in this regard",
      " As a result, it should be carefully considered whether to invest in the US",
      "Most of Washington's irrational measures come from the pretext of national security, which mirrors a loophole - in the US, it seems that national security is above all other security as well as the rights of ordinary people",
      " For Americans, such situation is dangerous",
      "This is because abusing national security as an excuse to hit the legal rights of its own citizens, or other countries is obviously not the practice of a normal country",
      "In the US, collisions and conflicts between the notion of national security and the US democratic system are emerging, which will heavily hit the country as well as its governance",

      " Photo: XinhuaWang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, recently paid a visit to Europe with an aim to reboot the China-Europe relations",
      " During this eight-day visit, Wang met with almost all the key European leaders, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, addressed the 59th Munich Security Conference in Germany and then finally talked with Russian President Putin",
      " Wang delivered a highly effective keynote speech at the MSC that was laced with overtures of peace, cooperation and mutual trust for mutual benefit",
      " \"China follows a new vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, as put forward by President Xi Jinping,\" said Wang in his speech",
      " Wang's remarks are a reflection of the thinking of the Chinese leadership toward global peace, stability through multi-polarization",
      "The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has played a significant role in disrupting the communication and exchange between China and Europe",
      " This has obviously given birth to a plethora of misapprehensions and misjudgments of China in Europe and seriously hampered the China-Europe cooperation",
      " Despite the fact that there are no fundamental incongruities between China and Europe on key matters, things gradually turned sour, particularly as the Russia-Ukraine conflict provided enough fuel for Washington to dissuade its European allies from engaging with China",
      " While maintaining their stands on the respective core interests, there is broad consensus, common interests, and a common stance between China and Europe",
      " The urge to enhance cooperation, interactions and engagements with China is still the dominant trait in Europe, as reflected by the massively positive response Wang received during his visit to Europe",
      "However, there has been a major shift in the Europeans' previous relatively independent foreign policy - devoid of the American influence in general - toward China",
      " The eruption of COVID-19 pandemic and the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict disrupted diplomatic engagement between China and Europe",
      " This provided an excellent opportunity to Washington to dictate its European allies on its China threat narrative",
      " The indirect collateral damage of the tense relations between China and the US is the widening chasm in the China-Europe relationship",
      " Wang's visit has at least resurrected the ties between the two sides and provided a starting point to reboot the lost impetus",
      " Throughout this tour, despite some extremely provocative and discouraging comments by certain hawkish elements in the West, Wang very effectively extinguished all such propaganda by consistently sticking to China's principled stand of peaceful coexistence",
      "France recently retracted the entry restrictions for Chinese travelers, while a similar decision is expected from the EU to drop the requirement of negative pre-departure COVID tests for visitors from China",
      " These decisions are not just symbolic in nature, but they highlight two important developments",
      " First, the European capitals are now grasping the rationale behind Beijing's COVID policy and they are accommodating the Chinese perspective on the matter",
      " And secondly, it also reflects a desire in Europe to engage positively with China by encouraging the frequent people-to-people interactions that will boost tourism, mutual trade and investments",
      " So, ice is breaking after Wang's trip",
      "Wang used this opportunity to comprehensively explain Beijing's position on the balloon episode, which is being deliberately exploited by the US to malign China as some sort of \"surveillance-obsessed\" country, as well as to effectively defend the Chinese stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " China has been proposing a negotiated peace deal to extinguish the Russia-Ukraine conflict that has so far catapulted the global economy into the worst kind of inflation storm",
      " The country issued China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis on Friday",
      "Not surprisingly, Washington, after its miserable failure to malign China through the balloon episode, is now blatantly using a new concocted allegation of weapons supply to Russia",
      " There is desperation in the Biden administration to fuel the anti-China propaganda through this new allegation pertaining to weapons supplies to Moscow",
      " Against this backdrop, Wang's visit to Moscow and meeting with Putin has caused much irritation in Washington, which is now unnecessarily portraying China's indirect involvement in the Ukraine conflict",
      " But China's Friday statement is a slap in their faces",
      "There is every reason to believe that the US is now deliberately trying to tag China with the Russia-Ukraine conflict so as to find a scapegoat for its failure in Ukraine",
      " The Americans know very well that its military and financial support will never enable Kiev to win this war of attrition and eventually the grand finale will be a negotiated deal",
      " That's why, they have already started docketing China in the Ukraine affair so as to find a \"reasonable excuse\" later on for their failure",
      " Wang, being a professional diplomat, very effectively utilized the last two days of his trip in Moscow to dispel this emerging narrative from Washington",
      " Nonetheless, through Wang's trip, Beijing has sent a clear message of its serious intent for closer cooperation with Europe and Russia for a better and peaceful world - certainly a well-timed stroke by Beijing",

      "He also praised the progress made in work on consolidating poverty alleviation outcomes, technological breakthroughs and ecological improvement",
      "Photo:XinhuaSolid steps have been taken to modernize the national defense and armed forces, while full and strict Party self-governance has proceeded at a deeper level, and social stability has been maintained, Xi said",
      "\"With the commitment to putting the people and lives above all else, we have constantly optimized epidemic response in light of virus development and the epidemic prevention situation,\" Xi said, noting that these efforts have protected the safety of people's lives and their health to the maximum extent, while minimizing the impact of COVID-19 in the economic and social fields",
      "The country successfully hosted the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics and celebrated the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland last year, Xi said, adding that the initiative to steer relations across the Taiwan Strait has been maintained, while major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics has been promoted to inject stability into this volatile world",
      "The hard-won achievements over the past year have come from the collective dedication and hard work of the Party and the people, Xi said",
      "\"As long as the Party stands together with the people, always remains true to the people's aspirations and works in concert with the people, our iron-will will not be wavered by any storm, and our strides will not be stemmed by any difficulties,\" he said",
      "Photo:XinhuaNoting that 2023 will be the first year for fully implementing the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National Congress, Xi underscored the need to better coordinate COVID-19 response and economic and social development, better coordinate development and security, deepen reform and opening-up in all respects, achieve overall improvement of the economy, and steadily raise the living standards of the people",
      "\"The new journey ahead will be a long one filled with glories and dreams,\" Xi said",

      " Illustration: Liu Rui/Global TimesThe hysterical reaction in Washington DC to a drifting Chinese meteorological balloon raises many questions",
      " Can Washington appropriately manage relations with China? Will relations continue sliding toward rock bottom?American politicians and mainstream media went ballistic over the balloon lazily drifting in the stratosphere above North America",
      " Apparently, Canada kept calm relatively and carried on",
      "The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) operated by the US and Canada duly performed its job monitoring the wayward balloon",
      " Although the command was set up in the Cold War era to monitor incoming nuclear missiles and strategic bombers it apparently does a good with stray balloons",
      "It should be noted that US Army plans for the use of high-altitude balloons for the purpose of a layer of surveillance, communications, and range extension",
      " Testing and experiments with high-altitude balloons have taken place at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico",
      " The operational range is 60,000 to 90,000 feet in altitude",
      "The political frenzy in Washington bodes ill",
      " It demonstrates an unsteadiness and lack of judgment in the US political leadership",
      " The Pentagon stated that the balloon did not pose a national security threat to the US, but the nervous White House politicos ordered it shot down",
      "Shooting down a meandering balloon unnecessarily as a grandiose media stunt does nothing to stabilize the greatly deteriorated US-China relationship",
      " In fact, the action reinforces the observation by some world leaders that the US is unreliable and not capable of serious diplomacy",
      "Managing incidents at sea or in the air is part and parcel of international life",
      " Countries sign diplomatic agreements to establish procedures to handle such matters",
      " The balloon floated in the stratosphere",
      " Will China and the US develop procedures to deal with incidents in the stratosphere and in space above that?Of course, the US and China should have such agreements in place",
      " Accidents and various kinds of incidents can lead to grave confrontation so it is better to reduce any tensions through diplomacy",
      " Stabilizing US-China relations should be a key objective in bilateral diplomacy at this time",
      "Unfortunately, the direction of the relationship is in a downward spiral",
      " Under President Obama, the US initiated its \"pivot\" to the Pacific which involves military, diplomatic, and economic elements",
      " Under Trump the US unleashed both a trade war and a tech war",
      " Under Biden the US has intensified these things",
      " Under all three the militarization of the Pacific has gone forward",
      "What does Washington's frenzy over the balloon incident signal to the rest of the world? That the US is jumpy, nervous, and lacks confidence? That its leadership is unable to stay calm and properly manage affairs?The US had several diplomatic options",
      " The Chinese ambassador to the US could have been summoned for an explanation and to signal concern",
      " The US ambassador to China could have asked for answers and assurances from the Chinese Foreign Ministry",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/GTTikTok, which survived US' crackdown during the Trump administration, is once again facing a tightening political noose under the Biden administration",
      " Recently, the US maneuver of banning TikTok has become a hot topic in the US political arena and such actions have even spread to US allies such as Europe and Canada",
      "This is yet another political attack on Chinese companies in the name of national security - it is a political issue rather than a real security issue and an ideological issue rather than a legal one",
      " The accusation that TikTok poses security risks has no specific evidence and is not based on any existing laws",
      " Europe and the US have the most comprehensive legal and policy systems for cybersecurity and national security, and if TikTok brings privacy issues, these issues can be solved through corresponding mechanisms such as data localization and security review",
      "Obviously, security and privacy are just an excuse for the US to attack TikTok",
      " Politicians who want to destroy it and the business forces behind them do not want to give TikTok the opportunity and the rights to comply with local laws and regulations",
      " Nonetheless, US politicians cannot act recklessly and must consider the consequences, especially the four \"backfires\" caused by the ban",
      "First, it will backfire politically",
      " The essence of the problem TikTok is facing is a political issue rather than a real business competition or security and privacy issue, so it is not justifiable",
      " Although it is not enough for the company to rely solely on itself to effectively resolve it, the company can still use legal weapons to fight back and assert its rights",
      " With the deepening of its Project Texas, which aims to safeguard user data and protect US national security interests, TikTok will continue to increase the transparency of its platform maintenance work, including setting up its European Transparency and Accountability Centre in Dublin, and make the public understand its powerful and comprehensive methods for solving national security issues to the greatest extent possible",
      "Second, it will backfire because of users",
      " The top-down political suppression is highly destructive",
      " However, TikTok has over 100 million users in the US, and the denial of the right to use this popular service for hundreds of millions of US users, especially young users, will inevitably cause significant social backlash",
      " Statistics show that TikTok's advertising revenue exceeded $11 billion in 2022, and has become the main source of income for many top tiktokers",
      "Third, it will backfire on the global market",
      " The long-term negative effects of the US ban on TikTok cannot be underestimated because currently, US internet giants have a global planning, with businesses covering almost all countries",
      " With this precedent created by the US, other countries in the future can follow its example and obstruct and restrain US platforms by citing political factors",
      " Sanctions on TikTok are also likely to become the most powerful example for other countries to take similar measures against the US",
      "Fourth, it will backfire on the internet industry",
      " The US government's actions to ban TikTok will pose unprecedented dangers to the openness of the internet industry",
      " On April 28, 2022, the US government, together with over 50 countries, signed and released \"A Declaration for the Future of the Internet,\" which includes pledges to support the future of the internet \"that is an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure\" and that \"businesses of all sizes can innovate, compete, and thrive on their merits in a fair and competitive ecosystem",
      "\" However, actions against TikTok clearly undermine the core of the declaration",
      "Clearly, with the US continuously escalating its attacks on China's rise, the pressure on TikTok will further intensify",
      " The TikTok incident has become a product of the highly intertwined factors of political and business interests, which mutually catalyze and cooperate with each other",
      " Therefore, we can hardly feel optimistic about the future situation",
      " Simply relying on normal business logic, concessions, and compromises is unlikely to effectively alleviate the current crisis",
      "TikTok is China's first successful globalized internet company and has milestone significance for China's high-tech and development",
      " Therefore, TikTok has become another \"sacrificial lamb\" after Huawei",
      " Chinese companies should use legal weapons to firmly defend their legitimate rights and interests",
      " Regarding the First Amendment, if the government can solve the \"risks\" brought by TikTok without banning it, such as through negotiation agreements on how TikTok stores and shares data, then the ban on TikTok cannot be justified, and this argument can also become the core of TikTok's legal challenge",
      "Chinese companies urgently need to build systematic public goods to globalize and get out of the predicament of going solo",
      " Facing various political interventions by the US, whether it is semiconductors, 5G communication equipment, or the internet, accelerating China's high-tech rise in the global market is the most powerful way to fight back against Western politicians and the fundamental solution to the problem",

      "07 million civilian guns are registered, indicating that the vast majority of firearms owned by civilians are left unregistered and uncounted",
      "\u25c6A latest study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) reveals that the United States is in the midst of a massive gun-buying boom that shows no signs of abating",
      " From 2000 to 2020, annual production of firearms in the country almost tripled, with a dramatic increase in the past three years in particular",

      " Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the firearm homicide rate in the United States reached its highest level since 1994",
      " According to a survey by the Giffords Law Center, 32 of the country's 50 largest cities witnessed a prominent increase in firearm homicides in 2021",

      " According to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), from 2018 to 2021, the proliferation of guns not only resulted in a spike in homicides across the country, but also led to more suicides by people with mental illnesses",
      " According to the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), gun-related casualties surged to 85,584 in 2021 from 34,231 in 2014",
      " Among the nearly 95,000 homicides between 2015 and 2019, about 74 percent were committed with firearms",

      " According to GVA data, both mass shootings and deaths in the United States have surged about fourfold since 2013",

      " The mass shooting at the Columbine High School in Colorado in April 1999 killed 13 people and left more than 20 injured",
      " In April 2007, the shooting at Virginia Tech resulted in the death of 32 students and faculty members",

      "\u25c6Gun violence has also taken a toll on the everyday life of the American people",
      " A poll conducted by the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 21 percent of American adults have experienced gun violence in which their relatives, friends or themselves have been threatened with a gun or have fallen victim to a shooting",
      " As many as 54 percent of black and hispanic Americans say that they have had similar experience",
      " The Associated Press reported a survey by the American Psychological Association (APA), which shows that one-third of American adults feel they cannot go anywhere without worrying about being a victim of a mass shooting, and nearly a quarter of them admit that they have changed their behavior due to fear of mass shootings",
      "II",
      "Gun Control: An Uphill Battle in the United StatesSince the end of the 19th century, US state and local governments have made various attempts to introduce legislation on gun control, but such efforts all ended up either long in words but short on action, or flip-flopped",
      " No real progress was made on gun control",
      "\u25c6The second amendment to the US Constitution provides for the right of individuals to keep and bear arms",
      " In recent years, as gun-related issues have become increasingly prominent, pro-gun and pro-control advocates have engaged in heated debates on the interpretation of the second amendment",
      " Organizations that support gun rights claim that individual rights should not be arbitrarily modified and gun control is illegal",
      " Organizations that support gun control argue that the second amendment establishes a collective right, rather than an individual right to possess guns, and the government has the right to control guns",
      " Such debates have resulted in stalled efforts on gun control legislation, and Supreme Court rulings based on the second amendment are often not in favor of gun control",
      "\u25c6In the United States, there is significant disparity in gun control from state to state, and relevant legislation efforts at the federal level are often slow, inconsistent and contradictory",
      " In 1927, an act passed by Congress banned mail shipment of firearms such as pistols and revolvers to individuals, but did not prohibit the delivery of such firearms through private delivery firms",
      " Under this act, individuals are allowed to buy guns across state lines",
      " In 1968, the Gun Control Act passed by Congress did not include registration and licensing requirements for all firearms and their carriers, nor did it ban the import of firearm components",
      " In 1969, the lobbying power of the US National Rifle Association (NRA) propelled Congress to waive requirement for registration of buyers' information by sellers of shotgun and rifle cartridges",
      " In 1986, the Firearms Owners' Protection Act signed by President Ronald Reagan made it easier for unlicensed individuals to sell firearms",
      " It also allowed firearms to be sold at gun shows, and banned the establishment of any comprehensive system of firearm registration",
      "\u25c6In 2005, Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which protects firearm manufacturers from civil liability for crimes committed with their products",
      " Pro-gun groups have also used legislation and federal courts to resist gun control efforts",
      " In June 2008, the US Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in the case of District of Columbia v",
      " Heller",
      " With this ruling, the District of Columbia lifted the ban on handguns and allowed individuals to keep guns at home",
      " Justice Antonin Scalia, who presided over the case, noted that the second amendment protects an individual's right to keep and bear firearms, and that the District of Columbia's ban on handgun possession in the home violated that right",
      " The Supreme Court's ruling and its opinion on this case have directly affected gun control legislation across the United States",
      " In 2012, in the wake of a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary school, Senators Joe Manchin and Patrick Toomey drafted a compromise bill to expand background checks on gun buyers",
      " The bill fell short of the 60 votes required to move forward and was thus defeated",
      " In the ensuing decade, all congressional efforts to pass bills to enhance background checks on gun buyers ended up in failure",
      "\u25c6In March 2021, the House passed the \"Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021\", which requires background checks on all gun sales",
      " In May 2022, two mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde, Texas sparked hundreds of anti-gun violence demonstrations, and calls for gun control re-surged",
      " The Senate and the House adopted new gun control legislation, only after Democrats significantly weakened the control measures",
      " At the same time, however, the Supreme Court issued a ruling striking down New York State's 1911 law which restricts carrying a concealed firearm in public",
      " This directly undermined the ability of state and local governments to monitor firearms in New York, California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey, among others",
      "\u25c6Due to the difficulty of Congress to act on gun control, the US administration could only regulate certain types of firearms and firearm modifications through presidential executive orders",
      " In June 2022, Congress passed a gun-related bill called the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act",
      " According to a Pew poll, most people are not optimistic about the bill's effect in reducing gun violence in the United States",
      " Seventy-eight percent think it will do little, of which 36 percent think it will do nothing at all",
      "\u25c6The American public is deeply divided on gun control",
      " Public opinion polls in recent years have shown that women, urban residents, non-native borns, liberal-leaning people and non-gun owners are more likely to support gun control, while men, rural residents, native-born Americans, political conservatives, hunters and gun owners oppose it",
      " The gap between Americans' stance on gun control is still widening",
      "III",
      "Gun Violence Lays Bare the Decline of US Governance CapacityGiven a political system where different sides hold each other back, an increasingly polarized political ecosystem, pervasive interest groups and ineradicable racial discrimination, gun control in the United States is in stalemate, and a total ban on guns is effectively a mission impossible",
      "\u25c6How the US political system is designed and operates constitutes the root cause of ineffective gun control",
      " Gun control intensity varies across different states, making it increasingly difficult to regulate guns and perform interstate enforcement",
      " Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group, compared gun policies across the country, rating every state on the strength of its gun laws and comparing it with its gun violence occurrence",
      " A positive correlation was found between ineffective gun control and gun violence rate",
      " Eight states, including California and Hawaii, with comparatively well-established gun laws saw relatively low gun violence rates, while the 13 states with the weakest gun control, including Texas, Alaska and Missouri, have nearly three times as many gun deaths as the eight states mentioned above",
      "\u25c6Positions of Democrats and Republicans on gun control are becoming increasingly polarized",
      " In 1968, the House voted 305-118 and the Senate 70-17 to pass the Gun Control Act",
      " Since then, the two parties have been increasingly divergent over gun control",
      " Republicans have always supported gun ownership, while Democrats have unequivocally supported gun control",
      " Given the polarized US political landscape at present, it is even more difficult for either party to compromise",
      " The New York Times reported that since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook, despite a Democratic push for gun control, 14 Republican-controlled states have gone the opposite way, passing laws allowing their citizens to carry guns without any licensing process",
      " The Washington Post reported that in recent years, the Republican Party has posted a myriad of pictures and videos containing guns in newspapers, billboards and social media to appeal to voters who oppose gun control for campaigning purposes",
      "\u25c6Interest group lobbying is rampant",
      " Group politics and electoral politics in the United States have provided legalized channels for gun groups to conduct money politics and influence the stance of Congress members on guns",
      " According to OpenSecrets statistics, from 1990 to 2022, gun ownership groups contributed 69",
      "3 million US dollars to federal and state candidates, while gun control groups contributed 51",
      "6 million US dollars",
      " From 1998 to 2022, gun ownership groups spent 190",
      "4 million US dollars on lobbying, while gun control groups spent 28",
      "9 million US dollars",
      " In the 117th Congress, 262 members have been sponsored by the NRA, among which 19 have each received more than 1 million US dollars cumulatively",
      " The vast majority of them are Republicans",
      " Meanwhile, the NRA has spent handsomely against pro-gun control lawmakers",
      " All five of the lawmakers whom the association has paid millions of dollars to oppose are Democrats",
      "\u25c6Gun violence is exacerbated by long-standing social problems in the United States such as social inequality and racial tensions",
      " Research shows that blacks are much more likely to encounter gun murder than whites, and half of all gun murder victims are black",
      " In 2010, 14",
      "6 out of 100,000 blacks were murdered, compared with 1",
      "9 for whites",
      " According to research by the CDC, between 2019 and 2020, gun homicides nationwide rose from 14,392 to 19,350, with the occurrence rate up from 4",
      "6 to 6",
      "1 per 100,000 people, a 34",
      "6 percent increase",
      " Of the 90,498 gun-related deaths in 2020 and 2021, 38,796 were murders, among which nearly 21,000 involved young black males",
      "ConclusionThe right to life is the biggest human right",
      " The Declaration of Independence begins with the statement that life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are unalienable rights",
      " One gunshot after another have shattered the American Dream that all men are endowed with the unalienable rights to life and liberty, and lead people to reflect deeply on where the American-style human rights really are",
      " Some US politicians have long treated the American people's right to life with indifference",
      " Faced with growing gun proliferation, they have done nothing more than empty talks and prolonged debates, while pointing fingers at the human rights conditions of other countries",
      " The most important thing that they are duty-bound to do is face up to and address their own problems, and let the American people enjoy true freedom from the fear of gun violence",

      " Illustraion: Chen Xia/GTThe US has recently repeatedly claimed that China is preparing to provide \"lethal military aid\" to Russia in the ongoing Ukraine conflict, which is to incite the Western public opinion to pile pressure on China",
      " China has firmly denied the allegations made by the US",
      " What is the US meant to do?I believe the US is engaging in a \"preemptive accusation\" to prevent China from weighing in the conflict",
      " Ukraine war has been going on for more than a year",
      " According to the West's previous calculation, Russia should have already collapsed by now",
      " They didn't expect that Russia can still sustain now, and in recent days, it is advancing the encirclement of Bakhmut, a key hub for the supply route of the Ukrainian troops",
      "This war can no longer be viewed as a Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has evolved into a war of attrition between Russia and the West",
      " Ukraine provides troops, it is receiving all of its military supplies, including ammunition, from NATO",
      " While NATO is supposed to be much stronger than Russia, the situation on the ground doesn't appear so, which is causing anxiety in the West",
      "For example, last year, the Russian military consumed about 50,000 various types of shells per day, while Ukraine was only able to fire 5,000 shells per day",
      " By the end of the year, the Russian military was firing more than 20,000 shells per day, while Ukraine was still firing 5,000-7,000 shells per day, much lower than Russian troops",
      "This is a clear indication of the industrial nature of the war: the result depends on which side can produce more tanks and artilleries",
      " Both sides are using artillery as machine guns",
      " One hundred shells may not be enough to eliminate one enemy soldier",
      "Furthermore, Ukraine's own arsenal factories have been destroyed by Russia, and Ukraine's daily firing of 5,000 shells is equivalent to the annual supply of a small NATO country",
      " The United States originally purchased 15,000 shells per month, but the outbreak of the Ukraine war led to a sharp increase in purchases for aid",
      " Western media have exclaimed that the sum of all NATO countries' shells is not enough to meet the needs of the Ukraine in the battlefield",
      " Even if the Russian military was firing 20,000 shells per day, their ability to supply was still shocking to the West",
      " Where are these shells coming from? The West believes that Russia has purchased some \"low-quality shells\" from North Korea, but North Korea could not produce so many shells",
      " Therefore, Russia cannot be underestimated",
      " Although its economy is not large and it is seen as poor in the eyes of the West, its military-industrial mobilization capabilities are obviously stronger and more effective than those of the West",
      " The military-industrial foundation left over from World War II and the Cold War has at least been partially activated at critical moments to supply ammunition to the front-line troops",
      " In addition, Russia has air superiority in Ukraine and long-range missile strike capabilities, which can more effectively destroy Ukrainian ammunition depots, causing many weapons provided by the West to Ukraine to be destroyed before they can be used",
      "The US and the West have found it much more difficult than expected to defeat Russia",
      " They know that China has not provided military aid to Russia, and the question that haunts them is: if Russia alone is already so difficult to deal with, what if China really starts to provide military aid to Russia, using its massive industrial capabilities for the Russian military? Would the situation on the Ukrainian battlefield fundamentally change? Furthermore, Russia alone can already confront the entire West in Ukraine",
      " If they really force China and Russia to join hands, what changes will there be in the world's military situation?Recently, Russian President Putin stated that it is impossible to defeat Russia on the battlefield",
      " The current tactic of the West is problematic",
      " They want to keep dragging on until Russia collapses on its own",
      " But what if the Russian military launches a spring offensive and succeeds in completely pushing the Ukrainian troops out of the Donbas region? It would not be just Ukraine's failure anymore, but also a humiliation for the United States and the West",
      " If the military aid of the US and the West catches up and helps the Ukrainian troops repel the Russian military, are they not afraid that Putin will use nuclear weapon when he gets impatient? If nuclear weapon is used, the battlefield pattern previously created by artillery shells could be completely reset and rewritten",
      " Many Westerners are actually worried about this, and the US government is also concerned, but they seem incapable of balancing everything and forget that helping the Ukrainian troop win is just a comma, not a period",
      "So it's better to listen to China",
      " While the situation is deadlocked, but there is still room for maneuver, negotiations should be carried out to end the war earlier for the benefit of everyone",

      " Analysts said that the US and some Western countries should stop kidnapping the multilateral platform and pressing other countries to join the anti-Russia campaign as this is not conducive to solving the Ukraine crisis and won't help with addressing pressing global challenges",
      "The G20 foreign ministers' meeting will be held in New Delhi on March 1and 2 with US secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and their counterparts from other G20 states scheduled to participate",
      " Assuming the presidency of the G20 this year, India is reportedly seeking to build a consensus and bridge the gap between the West and Russia ahead of the meeting to arrive at a consensus-driven outcome, Indian media reported",
      "The news came after the G20 finance ministers on Saturday failed to adopt a joint closing statement at talks in Bengaluru",
      " Russia and China took a position that finance ministers and central bank governors should not get into geopolitical issues while the US, the European Union and the G7 nations insisted they could not back any outcome that did not include a condemnation",
      "As the US and some Western countries are imposing greater pressure on Russia with more sanctions when the Russia-Ukraine military conflict has been dragged on over the one year-mark, the upcoming G20 foreign ministers' meeting may face similar struggles in reaching the consensus needed to issue an official end-of meeting communiqu\u00e9, analysts said",
      "However, more countries especially developing countries and new emerging economies are becoming more worried and fed up with the US and some Western countries' attempt to hijack international meetings to air their grievances over the Russia-Ukraine conflict and use various platforms to pressure other countries to join their sweeping economic sanctions against Russia while the world desperately needs a political solution to the conflict as it faces spillover from the crisis and many more other pressing challenges, they noted",
      "Imperative on developmentsAs Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi remarked at the G20 Bali summit last year to make India's G-20 presidency \"inclusive, ambitious, decisive, and action-oriented,\" the country has made a packed agenda for the upcoming foreign ministers' meeting",

      "India, who has maintained good relations with Russia and the West, has more advantages in coordinating the two sides with some of their disputes",
      " But the tussle between Russia and the West over the conflict in Ukraine is intensifying with no one willing to make a compromise, which makes it more challenging to reach a consensus at the foreign ministers' meeting, Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Monday",
      "Qian said that the US and some Western countries may continue to beleaguer Russia and blame it for global economic problems and political messes at the upcoming meeting while Russia will strike back",
      " Such tangled battle will shatter the hope of more countries, especially India to boost joint efforts in focusing more global imperatives, especially on economy and developments",
      "The Russia-Ukraine conflict has a spillover effect on the whole world in many fields and peace talk may help alleviate many problems, including on energy and food crisis",
      " But pressing other countries to denounce Russia is not the right way for a truce, analysts said",
      "China on Friday unveiled a 12-point position document on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, calling on respecting the sovereignty of all countries and resuming peace talks, abandoning the Cold War mentality, ceasing hostilities, and protecting civilians and prisoners of war",
      "Qian noted that China's calling for peaceful settlement of the Ukraine crisis reflects the aspiration of many developing countries and new emerging economies for peaceful settlement of the crisis but has been dismissed and smeared by the US, which shows which country hijacks the whole world for its own interests",
      "With the majority of the international community concerned with more pressing issues on food, energy, security and economic crises and eager to find solutions, the US and some Western countries have been willfully pushing their agenda with their own strategic calculation, which not only exposes their selfishness and hegemony mind-set but also destroys the fundamentals of the G20 mechanism and other multilateral platforms, said analysts, noting that the original intention of the G20 is to solve crises instead of turning it into a stage for displaying a Cold War mentality",
      "The G20 should prioritize dealing with economic upheaval and the stabilization of global economic development as global supply and industrial chains in energy and semiconductors and other domains have been greatly impacted with fragmentation of policies in the US and the EU, Huo Jianguo, vice president of the China Institute for World Trade Organization Studies, told the Global Times",
      "It would be hard to lift a world that falls into recession and amid intensifying confrontations between the US, the West and Russia and fiercer China-US competition, the G20 mechanism should play a bigger role in coordinating and driving global economic development, said Huo",
      "However, what the US and some Western countries are doing, including attacking China and tying up the Russia-Ukraine conflict with economic issues, will further sabotage the global economic development, said analysts",
      "Clinging to the Cold War mentality and ideology, the small cliques drawn by the US will lead the globalization astray, create more confrontations, further destroying the global industrial and supply chain and trapping the global economic development, said Huo",
      "The expert noted that possibility cannot be ruled out that some political elites in the US and European countries may attempt to use the Ukraine crisis to restrain developments of new emerging economies, which is very risky as no country can detach itself if the whole world is in deep water",

      "Photo:China MilitaryThe aircraft carrier Liaoning of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, featuring a record number of Type 055 10,000 ton-class large destroyers as its escorts, reportedly sailed across the Miyako Strait and entered the West Pacific for routine exercises on Friday, the same day that Japan broke away from its defense-only postwar principle and announced plans to equip itself with first attack-capable missiles, allowing itself to hit China",
      "As the most powerful Liaoning aircraft carrier group yet, the PLA flotilla is expected to host a number of realistic combat-oriented exercises beyond the first island chain, enhancing its capabilities in safeguarding national sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests, military experts said",
      "Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force spotted a PLA Navy flotilla consisting of the aircraft carrier Liaoning, the Type 055 large destroyers Anshan and Wuxi, the Type 052D destroyer Chengdu, the Type 054A frigate Zaozhuang and the Type 901 comprehensive replenishment ship Hulunhu sailing from the East China Sea through the Miyako Strait into the West Pacific from Thursday to Friday, Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff said in a press release on Friday",

      "It is not known if all of the above-mentioned vessels are actually parts of the carrier group, but the record-breaking number of 10,000 ton-class Type 055 large destroyers could mean that this is the most powerful configuration of the Liaoning carrier group yet, observers said",
      " Previously, there had only been one Type 055 featured in the group, and this time it is up to three",
      "The Liaoning aircraft carrier group is apparently on a routine training exercise, in which vessels within the group will practice coordinated moves and joint operations, and carrier-based fighter jets will practice takeoffs and landings, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Friday",
      "Song said that Type 055 large destroyers are the best escorts of Chinese aircraft carriers, and it is also possible that the Liaoning carrier group also has nuclear-powered submarines in it",
      "Drills like this have already become normal and regular, Song said",
      "In May this year, the Liaoning aircraft carrier group held a far sea exercise in the West Pacific, to the east of the island of Taiwan and south of Japan",
      " With over 300 aircraft sorties in some 20 days, the mission marked the longest and most sortie-intensive exercise by the Chinese carrier in the region",
      "Friday, the day when the Liaoning carrier group sailed through the Miyako Strait, also happens to be the day when Japan adopted a national security strategy declaring plans to possess preemptive strike capability and cruise missiles within years to give itself a more offensive footing against \"threats\" from China, AP reported on the day, calling the move a major break from its strictly self-defense-only postwar principle",
      "Facing Japan's continued attempts to revise its defense strategies and expand its armed forces, the PLA needs to enhance its combat readiness to deal with possible emergencies, Song said",
      "\"Our exercises are not aimed at any third party, but if a third party poses threats to China, then it must feel the exercises are targeting it,\" Song said",
      "The PLA will resolutely safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and stop other countries from interfering in the Taiwan question, Song said",

      " They slandered the situation of human rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong, and interfered in its judicial proceedings",
      "The Chinese side urged the US politicians to stop their twisted political show immediately, as they flagrantly denigrated the human rights and rule of law in Hong Kong and interfering in its normal judicial system, a spokesperson of the office said in a statement",
      "A National Security Law trial of 47 opposition figures began on Monday in Hong Kong, drawing widespread attention both locally and overseas",
      " The ultimate intention of these suspects was to take power in HKSAR by using loopholes in the city's electoral system and to seek independence by colluding with external forces, according to media reports",
      "Prosecutors on Monday began explaining their basis for accusing the 47 suspects of conspiracy to commit subversion, in the high-profile case",
      "Representatives from the UK, the US, Sweden, Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, European Union and France were also among those queuing up outside the court on Monday, according to the Guardian",
      "Laurence Vandewalle from the European Union Office to Hong Kong and Macau, said the EU had been observing trials across the world \"as a sign of commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law\", the report noted",
      "The Commissioner's Office spokesperson pointed out that before the nomination of candidates for the Seventh Legislative Council of the HKSAR (LegCo) in 2020, those anti-China elements in Hong Kong had conspired to organize a \"primary election\" and fabricate public opinions in an attempt to seize control of the LegCo",
      "In so doing, they sought to paralyze the SAR Government and pressure both the Central and the SAR governments, said the spokesperson, adding that such a despicable plot not only jeopardized the democratic electoral system stipulated in the Basic Law of the HKSAR, but is also suspected of committing the crime of subversion under the National Security Law for the HKSAR",
      "Enforcing laws and holding lawbreakers accountable is the core tenet of the rule of law",
      " No one has the privilege to be above the law, and no rights and freedoms should cross the bottom line of national security",

      "However, some politicians from a few countries insist on hypocrisy and double standards, repeatedly interfere in the judiciary of the HKSAR, and put political manipulation above the law",
      " Without caring about democratic chaos in their own countries, they vilified the National Security Law for the HKSAR, sugarcoated anti-China forces in Hong Kong as \"fighters for freedom,\" and meddled with the judiciary of the SAR, the spokesperson noted",
      "The spokesperson stressed that the rule of law is a cornerstone of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and \"one country, two systems\" has always been upheld based on the rule of law",

      " Zhu Fenglian Photo: Taiwan Affairs Office of the State CouncilWith the epidemic being well controlled on the Chinese mainland at present, the mainland has urged the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities in Taiwan to resume normal operations of direct cross-Straits flights to benefit compatriots on both sides, according to Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, on Wednesday",
      "Compatriots on both sides of the Straits and the airline industry are eager for the full resumption of direct flights across the Taiwan Straits, Zhu said",
      "So far, four passenger routes of \"mini three links\" have all resumed service, making cross-Straits travel more convenient for residents from Kinmen and Matsu, both outlying islands in the Taiwan Straits",
      " Since the passenger routes resumed on January 7, a total of 62 round-trips have been operated, safely facilitating 6,715 passenger visits, according to China's Ministry of Transport on Wednesday",
      "At 10 am on Sunday, Jishun No",
      "9 ferry carrying 59 passengers set sail for the passenger terminal in Lianjiang county and returned to Matsu at 12:30 am on the same day",
      "Since the official launch of the passenger routes in 2001, 217,000 trips have been operated safely, transporting 22",
      "08 million passenger trips, according to the authorities",
      "On February 1, the mainland aviation authorities urged the island to prioritize the resumption of direct flights to 16 mainland destinations, including South China's Guangzhou",
      " A response has yet to be received, according to Zhu",
      "The mainland strongly supports airline industry on both sides of the Taiwan Straits to significantly increase flights across the Straits, and airlines are allowed to dynamically optimize flight arrangements independently, Zhu said",
      "A total of 214 passenger flights were operated between February 13 and 19, up from about 100 in a week before January 8, the spokesperson said",
      " However, compared with the maximum of 890 scheduled weekly flights before 2020, the current capacity is insufficient to meet the needs of both sides, Zhu noted",
      "Under the unilateral restrictions imposed by the DPP authorities, there are only four direct flight destinations in the mainland - Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen and Chengdu, so that the cross-Straits exchanges are still quite inconvenient generally, Zhu noted",

      " Illustration: Liu Rui/GTRecently, \"green\" has become a hot topic in Europe, largely as a result of the stimulus provided by the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)",
      " European capitals worry that the act will undermine their firms' competitiveness in the global market",
      " Against the backdrop, French and German economy ministers protested US' green subsidies on their Washington trip on Tuesday",
      " Why does Europe attach so much importance to green industries? Will the US make any concessions? Or will Europe's green ambitions run into a brick wall?The reason why Europe favors green industry is with far-sightedness",
      " On the one hand, there are economic considerations",
      " Europe is a highly developed global economy, but it faces the problem of weak growth momentum",
      " There are many reasons for this, such as deindustrialization, an aging population, declining labor productivity, insufficient technological innovation, etc",
      ", but the core problem is that no new growth point has been found",
      "Compared with China and the US, Europe neither has any advantage in traditional manufacturing fields, nor does it have been able to catch up with the new wave of digital technology",
      " However, in the field of green environmental protection, Europe, which is short of energy, has been relatively ahead, with an early start and rich experience",
      " Europe has always regarded green industry as a core pillar of future development, especially after the Russia-Ukraine conflict brought a huge energy crisis shock to Europe",
      "On the other hand, there are political considerations",
      " Compared with hard power such as the military, Europe has always attached more importance to soft power, especially so-called normative power, that is, to influence and shape the behavior preferences of other international actors by formulating and guiding rules, so as to ensure its own global dominance",
      "Europe launched the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) in 2005, and since 2012, carbon emissions from aviation have been included in the EU ETS",
      " Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said: \"We have a once in a generation opportunity to show the way with speed, ambition and a sense of purpose to secure the EU's industrial lead in the fast-growing net-zero technology sector",
      "\"Obviously, it is not an exaggeration to say that green industries are the top priority of Europe's development, because it involves not only Europe's future economic and social development, but also its status and role in the world",
      " Although the original intention of US President Biden's IRA was not aimed at Europe, in fact, it caused European companies to be tempted to go to the US, resulting in Europe's green plan suffering a serious setback",
      " Therefore, at the end of last year, French President Emmanuel Macron visited the US and met with Biden",
      " In addition to highlighting so-called friendship and unity, one of the key points was to hope that Biden would give more consideration to the situation in Europe",
      " This time the French and German economic ministers went to the US again with this important task",
      "The question is, will the US buy into Europe? That seems unlikely",
      " The US only prioritizes its own interests",
      " At this point, there is no essential difference between administrations of Trump and Biden; the difference is only in the specific methods adopted",
      "Europe is an ally of the US",
      " The US also supports European integration in many cases, but the overarching purpose is to serve the hegemony of the US",
      " A Europe under its control is the most satisfying to the US",
      " Although the Ukraine crisis is complicated, there is no doubt that the military, energy, financial and other interest groups in the US have made a great deal of profit and it is Europe that has largely borne the economic cost of the crisis",
      "When the US sold energy to Europe at a price four times higher than its own, Macron had to sigh, \"In a spirit of great friendship",
      "",
      "",
      " [this] can't go on for too long",
      "\" This reminds people of German Chancellor Angela Merkel who also said when the communication with Trump failed, \"Europe can't rely on 'others",
      "'\"Hence, no matter how eagerly Europe looks forwards to it, it seems unlikely that the US will change course",
      " Even if Biden finally makes some kind of token compromise, it can only be an exchange of interests between the two parties, but the question is, what will Europe offer in exchange? To get further involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and deal with Russia, or to follow the US and join forces against China? The costs seem to be too great for Europe to bear",
      "Of course, if we look beyond the competition between Europe and the US, we will find at least one problem, that is, the future will really be an era that values green, which is already the trend of the whole world",
      " The competition will only become more and more fierce and complex, and all parties will be involved in it",

      "The CNN hyped that this is \"stark evidence of the tensions brewing in the South China Sea, and between the US and China",
      "\" However, the US Navy says these missions are \"routine,\" implying that such regular provocative harassment by US forces in the South China Sea will continue",

      "Freedom of navigation is a pretext for the US to intervene in the South China Sea affairs",

      " It has been instigating tension in the South China Sea, making itself a disrupter of peace and stability in the region",
      " Such a dangerous and irresponsible approach seriously deviates from the common will of countries around the South China Sea",

      " Many leaders of countries around the South China Sea have publicly stated that they will not take sides between China and the US, let alone follow the US in the South China Sea to conduct their so-called freedom of navigation operations",
      "China has always respected and supported freedom of navigation and overflight enjoyed by all countries in the South China Sea in accordance with international law",
      " But this freedom in no way means that foreign warships and military aircraft can violate international law, disregard the legitimate rights of other countries and jeopardize the safety of aviation and navigation",
      " US ships and aircraft have frequently conducted close-in reconnaissance and \"freedom of navigation operations\" in the South China Sea for years",
      " These are extremely irresponsible moves that are highly likely to lead to miscalculations and marine and aviation accidents",
      "While continuing the Donald Trump administration's unscrupulous frenzy of containment and suppression against China, the Joe Biden administration proposed setting up \"guardrails\" on China-US relations to prevent competition from becoming conflict",
      " But at the same time, it is constantly creating new problems, harming China's interests, and threatening global security",
      "What Washington means is clear: The US can provoke China, but the latter cannot counterattack or respond",
      " Instead, Beijing should help build \"guardrails\" to protect Washington's safety",
      " This is utterly overbearing",
      "The world can see very clearly that if the US does not stir up troubles, there is no need to set up any \"guardrails\" or for any \"crisis management",

      " It is obviously trying to make an issue of it",

      " Photo: Fan Lingzhi/Global TimesThe US recently has escalated hype about a military conflict scenario in the Taiwan Straits, hinting at a commitment to \"defend the island,\" but such moves are no more than fooling the island to follow the US' anti-China strategy and using Taiwan as a pawn, analysts said on Wednesday",
      "No matter how \"Taiwan independence\" forces attempt to trumpet \"US' support,\" more and more people on the island have recognized the so-called protection is not reliable or trustworthy at all, according to analysts",
      "The US House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday advanced a raft of China-related sanctions bills, a sign of increasing hawkishness in the Republican-controlled chamber amid strained relations between Washington and Beijing, Bloomberg reported",
      "Taiwan media hailed those \"supporting Taiwan\" bills as economic deterrents to thwart China from military operations and ensure Taiwan island's international membership, including in the IMF",
      "The US is reportedly planning to increase its military presence on the island",
      " Such an arrangement is intended to enhance coordination between the militaries of the US and the island in case of a war, Voice of America reported on Wednesday",
      "The news came after the island's regional leader Tsai Ing-wen announced plans to enhance military exchanges after meeting with US lawmakers",
      "A recent small-scale poll by Rasmussen Reports found less than half of Americans would support US ground troops to be involved in a cross-Straits conflict",
      " Economic sanctions were agreed to by more among the 900 respondents",
      "Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the poll, given its sampling scale, is not representative",
      "The US, sticking to its path of \"using Taiwan to contain China,\" has been hyping a \"mainland invasion\" to tie the island onto its chariot, Xin said, predicting salami-slicing provocations would continue and escalate because the US saw the island as a handy \"card\" to play in the US-China rivalry and it has \"aides\" - the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities and \"Taiwan independence\" forces - on the island",
      "But whoever on the island trusts Washington's \"lip service of defense\" will be abandoned miserably",
      " What the US has done to other countries and regions, especially those it called \"allies\" in the past decades, clearly shows how fragile US promises and commitments are, Xin said",
      "Noting the dangerous narrative of \"Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow,\" the expert asked \"The US would not confront Russia directly for a sovereign state, so why would it confront China for the island of Taiwan, which is China's own inalienable territory?\"Such a comparison only aims to fool the island, but more and more Taiwan residents have recognized the US' poor credibility and the risk of becoming cannon fodder in the China-US rivalry, Xin said",
      "Reports that the US was considering plans to destroy the island in the event of a military conflict have made a splash on the island",
      " The transfer of semiconductor supplier TSMC to the US convinced some to believe this",
      "Zhu Songling, a professor at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of Beijing Union University, told the Global Times that the US has multiple plans for the unfolding of cross-Straits situations, and will choose whichever benefits the US most",
      " The destiny of Taiwan island and local residents is never on the US' mind",

      " On the other hand, Ukraine has no independent defense capability at all, it is 100 percent reliant on assistance from the US and NATO, L\u00fc added",
      "That being said, the conflict is turning into a rabbit hole for the US",
      " How much the US will be willing to offer, and how much will the US gain in return? Will Washington's military assistance be self-serving or self-hurting? The tides are shifting on this question",
      " On the battlefield, Ukraine has been difficult to push Russia back",
      " Beyond the battlefield, Ukraine is going through a slew of high-level dismissals, with large numbers of young people, elites and talent leaving their homeland, observers said",
      "The US posture is looking increasingly incoherent in terms of policy-making regarding Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " As it has set a rather high anti-Russia tone in domestic politics, the US has been left with little room for making geopolitical compromise",
      "Analysts believe that Russia can survive a war of attrition, which has instead \"left the NATO countries virtually defenseless, having emptied their own inventories to supply Ukraine,\" according to George Galloway, a six-term British parliamentarian, in remarks made during an interview with Global Times",
      "While Washington has talked a lot about international solidarity, it is making efforts to withdraw itself",
      " The US has in fact wanted Poland to instigate EU and play a bigger role, replacing the US",
      "One year on, the US, the initiator of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, has started to waver, as it doubts whether the political pressure is too big for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to bear and the continuous plight it stuck itself in",
      "Supply of more advanced weaponry will further provoke Russia and risk expanding the war",
      " If the Russia-Ukraine war spills over, the first to suffer will be Poland and Romania, two NATO members under the protection of NATO's Article 5 collective defense obligation",

      " Photo: XinhuaThe US, in consecutive provocative moves over the Taiwan question, has in the past few days approved another arms sale to the island of Taiwan and advanced its National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) through Congress, which includes direct military loans and fast-track weapon sales",
      "Such sales would not change the total military advantage the Chinese mainland possesses, but experts underlined that the US' continuous provocations, despite its president's repeated promises not to support \"Taiwan independence,\" have laid bare the country's poor credibility and ulterior intention of using the \"Taiwan card\" to stir up trouble for China's development and reunification path",
      "The newly approved arms sales included spare aircraft parts to support Taiwan's fleet of F-16 fighters, C-130 transport planes and other US-supplied weapons systems, the Associated Press reported",
      "Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Thursday that the US has sold F-16 fighters and been updating F-16V fighters, which means there is a large demand for replacements and spare parts",
      "The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) dreams of raising the budget to increase the attendance rate of the F-16 fighters, but the cross-Straits strength gap is impossible to be narrowed by the DPP no matter how much the DPP strives to arm itself, Song said",

      "\"Mao Ning, a spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urged the US to stop creating tensions across the Taiwan Straits, stop playing the \"Taiwan card\" to contain China and stop going further down the wrong and dangerous path, at Thursday's routine press briefing",
      "In a statement released on Thursday in response to a question on the latest US arms sales to Taiwan island, Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, a spokesperson at China's Ministry of National Defense, said, \"In recent years, while making stern promises to China on the Taiwan question, the US has emptied and undermined the one-China principle, continued to sell arms to the Taiwan authorities, pushed 'legislations' that brought negative impacts on the Taiwan Straits,\" and sent senior officials to conduct activities in the island to further exacerbate tensions in the Taiwan Straits",
      "The US promise has been made but Washington contradicts what it says, and its contradictory practices fully expose its hypocrisy of saying one thing and doing another, which seriously damages the US' political credibility and international reputation, Tan said",
      "\"We urge the US to earnestly respect China's core interests and major concerns",
      " If it repeatedly breaks its promise, acts recklessly, and connives and supports Taiwan secessionists, it will inevitably aggravate the tensions in the Taiwan Straits and eventually draw fire to burn itself,\" Tan noted",
      "The Chinese People's Liberation Army will take all necessary measures to resolutely defend its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and resolutely defeat any form of external interference and separatist plots for \"Taiwan secessionism,\" Tan said in the statement",
      "Observers also slammed the US' consecutive provocations over China's red line, only a few weeks after the top leaders of the two countries met in Bali, in what had been seen as an opportunity for easing bilateral relations",
      "US President Joe Biden reaffirmed that the US does not support \"Taiwan independence\" and has no intention of engaging in conflict with China, but what the US is doing goes against that assertion",
      "The South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI), a Beijing-based think tank, detected a US P-8A anti-marine aircraft flying over the Taiwan Straits on Thursday",
      "According to a US State Department notice obtained by Bloomberg, the Biden administration has proposed selling Taiwan island as many as 100 of its most advanced Patriot air-defense missiles, as well as radar and support equipment in a deal valued at $882 million",
      "The NDAA, which is currently going through the US Congress, includes the Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act (TERA), which would authorize $2 billion in annual military aid for five years, providing grants and loans to the island of Taiwan to purchase US military equipment, services and training, Reuters reported",
      "It also authorizes another $1 billion annually of emergency defense assistance to Taiwan island",
      " A proposal that Taiwan be treated as a \"major non-NATO ally\" was removed from the bill",
      "Loans are not free aid, and the US is treating the island as a cash cow, trapping the DPP into debt while the burden is placed on all common people in Taiwan island, as the money could have been used to improve their livelihoods, Song said",

      "The Anshan, joined by Type 052D destroyers the Baotou and the Qiqihar, recently had the three-day full-course training acceptance test in the Yellow Sea, in which other vessels, submarines, fighter jets, early warning aircraft and helicopters acted as mock opponents, posing multiple threats simultaneously from the sea surface, underwater and in the air, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Saturday",
      "It required the sailors to deal with all kinds of emergencies in realistic combat scenarios, and tested their comprehensive air defense, sea attack and anti-submarine capabilities under complex electromagnetic environments while navigating around the clock, CCTV reported",

      "When the official Sina Weibo account of the PLA Navy on Sunday released a post introducing the Yinchuan, it said the destroyer \"conducted a solo run stretching over 10,000 nautical miles and sharpened its sword in the deep blue water",
      "\"A video attached to the post showed that the Yinchuan fired air defense and anti-ship missiles, hosted anti-submarine helicopter takeoffs and landings and received maritime resupplies from a comprehensive replenishment ship",
      "It did not give details on the voyage, including when or where it took place",
      "Being able to carry out a voyage of more than 10,000 nautical miles shows that the Type 052D destroyer's self-sufficiency has reached a new level, and that it can reach sea areas farther away, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times on Monday",
      "There is a range limit for a vessel to sail without replenishment, so the Yinchuan's solo run could be seen as exploring its extreme self-sufficiency, Wei said",
      "\"Generally speaking, in a long-distance solo voyage, a warship could still receive supplies from comprehensive replenishment ships in the early stage",
      " Later, when the warship goes further and goes solo, it could make port calls in friendly countries for replenishment, or receive supplies from friendly commercial ships in the vicinity,\" Wei said",
      "On December 22, 2022, the French Pacific Command said in a social media post that a Chinese destroyer was transiting near the exclusive economic zone of French Polynesia in the South Pacific",
      " The news website of the US Naval Institute identified the destroyer as the Yinchuan based on its hull number 175",
      "The linear distance between French Polynesia and the Chinese mainland is well beyond 10,000 kilometers, and since the Yinchuan couldn't have sailed in a straight line and may have sailed even further and eventually needed to return, the voyage would indeed have covered more than 10,000 nautical miles, observers said",
      "The PLA Navy is sailing increasingly deeper into the far sea for patrols and exercises, and its capabilities to safeguard China's strategic interests and carry out missions are also growing, Wei said",

      " The launching ceremony of the first TIR cross-border road freight line between Central China's Zhengzhou and Moscow on February 20, 2023 Photo: Courtesy of Zhengzhou Huanhang International Freight CoA truck loaded with Chinese-made daily commodities such as handsets departed from the Zhengzhou Xinzheng Comprehensive Bonded Zone in Zhengzhou, the transportation and manufacturing hub in Central China's Henan Province, on Monday before heading to Moscow, marking the first Transport Internationaux Routiers (TIR) cross-border road freight line between the two places as companies tap into the potential of booming China-Russian trade",
      "The truck service is a supplement for the China-Europe freight train, which has been running at full capacity amid rising trade flows, industry insiders said",
      " Monday's launch sets an example for similar cargo lines to be opened in response to vigorous market demand",
      "The development of the TIR-based global road transportation system, which China started full implementation of June 2019, enables vehicles with TIR certificates to cross borders between member countries in an easy and simplified manner, which means lower costs and less time",
      "So far, 77 countries have joined in this system, according to media reports",
      "In comparison with air, sea and rail transport, the TIR system can save up to 58 percent of the transportation time and 38 percent of the costs, the reports said",
      "Zhengzhou Hongyi Transport, a logistics company in charge of the delivery of the first batch of goods, has scrambled to deal with rising orders, mostly home appliances, which are piled up until May",
      "After departing from Zhengzhou on Monday, the first truck, which will bypass the China-Russia border port at Manzhouli in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is due to arrive at Moscow in eight days after a 9,800-kilometer journey, an employee with the company told the Global Times",
      "Some value-added goods such as handsets made in East China's Yiwu are being delivered by the truck, the Global Times learned",
      "The TIR line is a good supplement to the current options, particularly the China-Europe freight train, industry insiders said",
      "Zhang Tianbang, general manager of Zhengzhou Huanhang International Freight Co, who participated in the launch, is excited about the new transport service, since there is a growing need for diversified options",
      "Since the first China-Europe freight train was dispatched in July 2013, over 7,000 trains have run from Zhengzhou to Europe as of Sunday, serving more than 12,000 trade companies, a historic high",
      "While the China-Europe freight train is gaining more popularity and a wider reach, the new TIR truck service enables faster delivery, the insider said",
      "For example, the truck takes around 10 days to reach Central Asian countries and less than 12 days to Moscow, compared with around 16 days for a similar journey by train, Zhang said",
      "Given the high demand for the China-Europe freight train, one has to wait until March 10 for the earliest delivery, while the truck line, as a fairly new service, can be booked faster, Zhang said",
      "While domestic customs and port operators have been simplifying border-passing procedures and upgrading facilities, the low efficiency levels of some ports overseas, together with other factors, make it difficult to meet the demands of the fast-booming trade, particularly for exports, Song Kui, president of the Contemporary China-Russia Regional Economy Research Institute, told the Global Times on Monday",
      "Vigorous demand for Chinese daily commodities, driven by the fast development of cross-border e-commerce, has bolstered exports to Russia, Song said",
      "In 2022, China-Russia trade exceeded $190 billion, a year-on-year growth of 29",
      "3 percent",
      " Chinese exports to Russia amounted $76",
      "12 billion, jumping by 12",
      "8 percent year-on-year, data from the General Administration of Customs showed",
      "Russian Ambassador to China Igor Morgulov said recently during an interview with RIA that he expects trade between China and Russia this year to exceed $200 billion",
      "\"The opening of the cargo truck route, as a good supplement, will further promote bilateral trade, which is complementary,\" Song said, expecting more TIR transport lines to open soon",

      " US' game of manipulation Illustration: Liu Rui/GTIn an exclusive interview with Portugal's RTP TV channel published on Saturday, Chair of the NATO Military Committee (NMC) Rob Bauer claimed that NATO is ready for direct confrontation with Russia",
      " He pointed out that NATO's decision during the NATO summit in Madrid last year to establish four additional multinational battle groups in four member states is \"an important signal for Russia",
      "",
      "",
      " that we are prepared if they decide to go after NATO",
      "\"Bauer's remarks are intended to draw the red line for Russia to keep the military conflict in Ukraine from spilling over to NATO countries",
      " Currently, it is unlikely that NATO will directly intervene in the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      "However, this doesn't mean that the organization is not making military preparations for a potential direct confrontation with Russia, especially when it thinks Russia might tread on NATO's so-called red line",
      "Yet, NATO member states are actually not ready to confront Russia directly",
      " First of all, what Bauer said can only represent, at most, the military authority's opinion",
      " But as an advisory body that provides advice on military policy and strategy to the North Atlantic Council and direction to NATO's Strategic Commanders, the NMC doesn't have actual decision-making power",
      " Whether or not to go to a \"direct confrontation\" with Russia should be decided collectively by leaders of NATO members rather than Bauer or the NMC",
      "At the same time, NATO members have different opinions on this matter",
      " Many NATO member states understand that once NATO is involved in a direct military conflict with Russia, this will lead to a European war, or even a world war III or a nuclear war, endangering global stability",
      " Most countries in Europe are against a European war",
      " The US also doesn't want a direct confrontation with Russia, worrying about losing the benefits it has gained from the current situation",
      "Bauer also noted that rearmament is the transatlantic alliance's top priority, acknowledging that the organization has \"lost its monopoly on military initiative",
      "\" He then urged NATO countries to gear their civilian industrial production toward the defense industry",
      " \"These priorities should be debated on, partially, a war economy in peacetime,\" Bauer added",
      "Such words are, in fact, encouraging NATO countries to get ready for a war with Russia, even at the expense of sacrificing their normal economic growth",
      " But none of these countries is prepared for that",
      " As a result, Bauer's proposal is very difficult to find an echo in most NATO member states",
      "Bauer's statement perfectly reflects Washington's mentality regarding the current turmoil in Europe",
      " NATO's commitment to the principle of collective defense that an attack on one is an attack on all is a tranquilizer for NATO members, making them believe that the US-led organization is true to its word and Washington will definitely support NATO to protect them",
      " But judging from the experience of history, whether the US will keep its oath is still a myth",
      "It will soon be one year since the military conflict between Moscow and Kiev broke out",
      " During this period, the US made the conflict a proxy war with the support of NATO, which, in particular, played a crucial role in Washington's hybrid warfare with Moscow",
      " The US will continue to push other NATO countries to enhance their support for Ukraine at its will",
      "Fighting a proxy war in Ukraine is more in line with Washington's interests to maintain Western collective hegemony with the US at the core",
      " To achieve this end, Washington needs to support Kiev to counter and weaken Russia",
      " In the short term, pushing for peace while Russia is not weakened is not in the interests of the US",
      " Therefore, the US will inevitably push to continue the war in Ukraine",
      " At the same time, it will also manipulate countries such as NATO and EU members to increase their support for Ukraine",
      "Europe now has no way to get rid of the influence of the US and NATO, while its peace is now subject to NATO",
      " Washington has kidnapped the EU through NATO, and Europe has no choice but to follow the US' lead",
      "It is evident that before reaching its political and military goals, Washington does not want to see signs of peace in Ukraine",
      " Thus, it is challenging for Europe to maintain a peaceful situation",

      " File photo: ICThe Biden administration is considering cutting off Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co",
      " from all of its American suppliers, according to Bloomberg",
      " Huawei was amongst the first Chinese high-tech companies hit by US export restrictions",
      " Today, US suppliers need required government approval to sell to the company",
      " Yet most current applications for new licenses have languished in a stalled approval process",
      "Cracking down on Huawei has become a drill ground and a whetstone for the US' \"decoupling\" of high-tech with China",
      " From restricting the export of the US' own domestic technology to Huawei, to limiting the export of all global technology products containing US technology to the company, Washington's moves have become increasingly aggressive, mobilizing a larger sanctions regime",
      " The US is now doing the same by restricting Dutch and Japanese companies from exporting chipmaking equipment such as lithography machines to China",
      "As a result, Huawei's 2021 revenue fell by 28",
      "6 percent year-on-year, and the mobile phone business suffered huge losses",
      " However, the tech giant was not crushed",
      " Its global sales in 2022 stood high at 636",
      "9 billion yuan ($92 billion), almost the same as the previous year",
      " Huawei Cloud, digital power, and smart car business have created new increments",
      " Huawei's self-evaluation of 2022 is that it is a year Huawei would \"gradually move away from wartime situations to safety,\" and put forward the next slogan of seeking \"quality\" survival",
      "It is highly possible for Biden's team to continue to tighten the noose on Huawei, but most of their cards to suppress Huawei have already been played",
      " There has been very little room for the US to continue to hurt the company",
      "It is believed that Huawei is no longer taking any chances with the US government, and it is important for China as a whole to abandon all illusions and prepare for dealing with the more and more radical rhythm of \"decoupling\" of the US from China in the high-tech sector, and to be prepared for a worse situation in which US allies are forced to participate in a high-tech \"decoupling\" with China",
      " What we are facing is not an ordinary \"decoupling\" and blockade, but a US \"high-tech war\" against China",
      "The US dominates the major technology in this field, but the ability to manufacture equipment and produce chips is distributed among its multiple allies",
      " The manufacturers of those allies have an interest-based relationship with Chinese companies, and the overall interests of those allies are not very similar to those of the US",
      " However, we should not think that those allies will resolutely resist the US demand for \"decoupling\" from China for their own economic interests",
      " We must be prepared for them to succumb to Washington one by one",
      "Just a few days ago, it was reported that the governments of the Netherlands and Japan had surrendered to the US and reached an agreement to jointly ban the export of lithography machines and other key equipment for chip manufacturing to China",
      " China has now formed the mature ability to produce 28nm chips, and with the support of multiple exposure technology, it is also expected to achieve mass production of 14nm chips",
      " Besides, Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (Group) Co (SMEE)'s independent research and development of a 28nm lithography machine has made a breakthrough and has the opportunity to fully realize localization",
      " Our manufacturing equipment and chip production capacity are several generations behind the most advanced level, but China already has a solid foundation for independent research and development",
      "To establish the overall independence of semiconductor products, relevant Chinese companies need high investment in scientific research and large market returns",
      " It should be said that these two conditions are available in China",
      " China has a complete range of industries, sufficient domestic funds, and policy support in place",
      "As long as we are determined to conquer the commanding heights of semiconductors, with market push and national policy support, the momentum of chip research and development will gradually shift from the US and its allies to China after we endure a few years of difficulties",
      "China is the largest market for chips in the world, and technological progress is after all driven by demand",
      " China's existing technological capabilities are sufficient to build a solid bridge and channel between technological progress and market demand",
      " As long as China focuses on independent research and development, our stamina will grow day by day, and the old system dominated by the US will become weaker and weaker",
      " The future is on China's side",
      "After all, the US-led supply chain system is not owned by the US alone, but is composed of multiple forces",
      " It is dominated by politics, goes against market laws, and runs counter to the interests of companies",
      " Therefore, the US till now is unable to rally everyone at its call",
      " It needs a rather long uneasy mobilization process, and there will be many loopholes in it",
      " China can take advantage of these loopholes and use external forces to propel our independent research and development process",
      " And when our efforts gradually take effect, it will dampen the confidence of the US and its allies, making Washington more and more difficult to lead the team in blocking China's high-tech, and eventually disintegrating the bloc",
      "Eventually, China will reintegrate with the world when it comes to chip industry",
      " At that time, we will have the strategic initiative",
      " The reintegration will be equal to every party and China's national security will not be threatened",
      " As long as we follow this path in a very serious manner, it may only take about 10 years",
      " And US high-tech blockade against China will experience serious fatigue and completely collapse",

      " With many people still trapped under rubber, rescue efforts have ramped up",
      " It is indeed a race against time",

      " For instance, due to the blockade and sanctions, there is no fuel even to send aid and rescue convoys",
      " But such a humanitarian disaster is not enough to melt the cold-blooded heart of the US",
      "At the US State Department press conference on Monday, when a journalist asked why not the US government reached out to the Syrian government, which is the one that runs rescue operations and suggested the US lift the sanctions that have basically suffocated Syria, spokesman Ned Price said that using the earthquake as an opportunity to reach out to the \"Syrian regime\" would be \"ironic",
      "\"What the US can offer is just a drop in the sea to the US, but for Syrian people who are facing an uncertain future, it is not only urgent but also life-saving",

      "For a long time, Washington has classified Syria as a \"dictatorship",
      "\" The US' narrative of splitting the world into two with so-called dictatorship and democracy actually covers up its true intention of dividing the world according to US interests",
      " Putting ideology and self-interests over humanitarianism, Washington has reversed the order, Wang Guangda, executive director of the China-Arab Research Center on Reform and Development and a professor at Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times",
      "According to Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, the nature of US behavior is to reinforce its hegemony across the world, and in the Middle East region as well",
      " For Washington, dominance and resources are its primary considerations when crafting its security strategies and diplomacy, while humanity and norms are dispensable",
      " This can explain why the US is stealing oil from Syria when imposing sanctions on the country",
      " The bloody fingerprints of US imperialism are on the earthquake disaster of Syria",
      " That the barbaric behavior of the most powerful country in the world blatantly loots the wealth of one of the poorest countries in the world reminds the international community that US behavior must be stopped",
      "\"The UN should play a coordinating role in demanding the US to lift the sanctions on Syria",
      " China and Russia, two permanent members of the UN Security Council, can also launch an initiative to ask Washington to terminate sanctions against Syria",
      " In addition, the US can at least remove the blockade on Syrian earthquake relief and humanitarian aid,\" noted Wang",

      " China has decided to provide Syria with 30 million yuan ($4",
      "4 million) in emergency humanitarian assistance, which includes $2 million in cash aid and relief materials urgently needed by Syria",

      "The US' scheme is to use the hypersonic missile and the recently revealed B-21 stealth bomber to penetrate China's air defense, but the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has what it takes to defend the country, experts said on Tuesday",
      "A full prototype of the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, also known as the AGM-183A missile, was launched from a B-52 bomber off the coast of California on Friday, and all of the objectives of the test were met, CNN reported on Monday, citing a statement from the US Air Force",
      "The AGM-183A is a boost-glide missile that uses a booster rocket to accelerate a projectile to hypersonic speeds, before a glide vehicle separates from the booster and uses inertia to travel to its target, CNN said",
      "The successful test launch of the missile came after a series of failures in testing last year, forcing the Air Force to delay the project at a time when China and Russia have shown advances in their own programs, CNN reported",
      "During the Airshow China 2022 held in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province in November, the PLA Air Force put on display an H-6K bomber which carried a type of missile widely believed to be hypersonic",

      " Illustration: Liu Rui/Global TimesWith NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg having concluded a four-day trip to South Korea and Japan, the bloc's attempt to extend into Asia has been a topic of many international affairs observers",
      " There is even discussion on Twitter whether the NATO should become NAPTO - the North Atlantic Pacific Alliance, and bring in Australia, Japan, India, New Zealand and many more",
      "The US-led military group's current bid to expand into Asia is actually Washington's attempt to revise the post-war international order",
      " In the original so-called international order, NATO does not have any military presence in the Asia-Pacific region, let alone a military structure",
      " Today, in addition to eastward expansion, the NATO is also extending its functions far eastward, characterized by enhanced cooperation with the US' allies and close partners in Asia",
      "The fundamental logic of their cooperation is the globalization of the so-called collective security system, the NATO's core value and foundation",
      " Under such an arrangement, an aggressor against any one state is considered an aggressor against all other states",
      "The concept of the collective security system was born in the context of the Cold War",
      " As a result, when NATO is trying to extend its collective security arrangement to the Asia Pacific, it is to extend Europe's Cold War architecture here, threatening to the security of the region",
      "The NATO is trying to add its Asian allies and close partners, such as Japan and South Korea, into its collective security arrangement by stepping up their cooperation",
      " This would split the Asia Pacific, one of the most diverse region in the world, into two groups - one is under NATO's such arrangement, and another is not",
      "The so-called collective security is essentially selective security",
      " When some of US allies and close partners in the Asia Pacific are included into such an arrangement, the selected group and the non-selected ones will be fallen into a deeper security dilemma",
      "That is to say that no matter what beautiful rhetoric the NATO uses as a pretext to ramp up cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo, it will mean insecurity for Asian countries which are not under NATO's collective security system",
      "Asia is standing at a crossroads",
      " All regional countries should mull whether they head toward a path of grave security dilemma where contests in terms of security between two groups escalate, or solidify to avoid the region splitting into two and pursue their shared security",
      "To shun the treat of security dilemma triggered by potential NATO's expansion to Asia, it is critical for all regional countries, including China, Japan, South Korea, as well as countries in the Southeast and South Asia, to pursue shared security, instead of collective security",
      "The lessons of the Cold War are worth learning",
      " Asia should not repeat the same mistakes",
      " The Europeans have suffered a lot from the escalating security dilemma",
      " The ongoing Ukraine crisis is the fresh example, in which the whole Europe is in the grip of an energy crisis and surging prices",
      " There is a Chinese saying that \"Do not do unto others what you would not want done unto you",
      "\" It is hoped that NATO will not bring their suffering to the Asia-Pacific region",
      "All Asia-Pacific countries should proceed from the whole situation and take a long-term perspective to pursue their shared security, rather than the so-called collective security which is propagandized by NATO for immediate interests",
      " The prospect of collective security must be a less secure region",
      " And this is a security trap set by the US-led group",
      " All Asia-Pacific countries should stay vigilant toward NATO's attempt to impair the regional security",

      " Photo: AFPNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg delivered a speech at Keio University in Japan on Wednesday",
      " If we are to describe this speech, it would be labeled with \"poor level, bad influence, and insidious intentions",
      "\" It was not worth mentioning, but the negative trends of NATO and Japan exposed from its content deserve the high vigilance of the entire Asia-Pacific region",
      " It can be said that the speech is full of \"ominous omens",
      "\"Before visiting Japan, Stoltenberg went to South Korea",
      " Although he also played up the \"China threat\" in South Korea and tied China, Russia and North Korea together with malicious intent, his words were far less straightforward and blatant than in Tokyo",
      " Facing the Japanese audience, Stoltenberg spent a lot of time attacking China",
      " He said in a sensational tone, \"What is happening in Europe today could happen in East Asia tomorrow",
      "\" He also said unctuously, \"China is not our adversary,\" but what he said later was basically to smear and slander China",
      " He accused China of \"substantially building up its military forces, including nuclear weapons, without any transparency\" and said that China (the Chinese mainland) is attempting to assert control over the South China Sea, and threatening Taiwan",
      "Stoltenberg's words and actions in Japan and South Korea are very different, which reflects many deep-seated problems, indicating that the two countries play different roles in NATO's strategic design",
      " In Seoul, he mainly spoke to the South Korean side, which was the target of his persuasion and incitement, while in Tokyo, he spoke to the entire Asia-Pacific region, and the Japanese authorities stood by as accomplices and co-conspirators",
      "A joint statement was issued after talks between Stoltenberg and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on January 31, in which the common stance against China and Russia was very prominent, and the intention to interfere in the situation across the Taiwan Straits was very strong",
      " These will undoubtedly create risks of camp confrontation and division in the Asia-Pacific region",
      " The role NATO is playing is exactly the same as it has played on the European soil",
      " In other words, it is actually NATO itself that is promoting the idea that \"what is happening in Europe today could happen in East Asia tomorrow",
      "\"A wolf whose base camp and activities have been in the far west for a long time has found a foothold in East Asia with great ambitions",
      " Japan is the one who lured the wolf into the house, and also seeks a high-sounding reason",
      " As the secretary general of NATO, Stoltenberg is not qualified to dictate East Asian affairs, not to mention even giving outrageous statements",
      " To some extent, Japan created such an opportunity for him and NATO",
      " Stoltenberg did not hesitate to speak sweetly about Japan, saying that among NATO's partners, none is closer or more capable than Japan",
      " He also praised Japan's substantial increase in defense budget and revision of its security strategy, behaviors that have been widely questioned in the Asia-Pacific region",
      " NATO and Japan formed a vicious mutual reinforcement",
      "Obviously, NATO is an unwelcome \"guest\" to East Asia and the entire Asia-Pacific region",
      " Most members here view Stoltenberg's visit with suspicion and concern",
      " These doubts and worries are not unfounded; instead, they are quite necessary",
      " Probably only Japan has the most positive attitude toward NATO's intervention in the Asia-Pacific affairs",
      " It is not difficult to guess what Japan is thinking about",
      " The crux of the problem is that its perception of China is wrong",
      " It sees a fast-growing China as a threat and seeks to take measures like Washington's to block the pace of China's development",
      " However, it is impossible to achieve it with the power of Japan alone",
      " Therefore, Tokyo began to work hard to introduce foreign forces into the region and \"unite them\" to create military, diplomatic and political pressure on China",
      "As two political entities with a disgraceful history of war, both \"NATO's Asia-Pacificization\" and \"Japan's militarization\" face strong moral and practical resistance",
      " It is precisely because of this that the two sides appear to be more \"like-minded",
      "\" NATO's hand in the Asia-Pacific is trying to carve out a channel in Japan",
      " This kind of devilish deal is bad news for the Asia-Pacific and even the whole world",
      " All countries in the region, including peace-loving forces in Japan, should take precautions against and resist the connection between Tokyo and NATO",

      " Photo: Screenshot from the WeChat account of the PLA South Sea FleetFootage released by the Chinese navy on Wednesday of training in English on China's second aircraft carrier Shandong may have revealed some important details that were not previously known",
      " For instance, it's highly likely that the Shandong had a close encounter with a US aircraft carrier in the South China Sea, military experts said",
      "\"This is Chinese navy warship 17,\" a crew member hailed in both Chinese and English in a short video of the Shandong conducting actual combat training in the South China Sea, showing J-15 fighter jets flying around the clock",
      "\"It gives people an overwhelming sense of security,\" the Chinese navy described the Shandong's words on its official WeChat account",

      " During the joint cruise, the soldiers of Nanchang called down to foreign ships and aircraft followed in English: \"I am a Chinese Navy 101, I am sailing, keep a safe distance from me",
      "\"Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times that the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) warships and warplanes need to speak English when they encounter foreign warships and aircraft",
      "He believes it's possible the Shandong has had a close encounter with a US aircraft carrier in the South China Sea",
      "\"Normally, aircraft carriers from different countries always keep a safe distance once they meet on the high seas,\" said Song, adding that helicopters and ships from both sides will keep watch around each other's carrier and tell each other who they are and what they are sailing for without hostility",
      "In addition, the expert said there are two possible situations for shouting that could have occurred when the Shandong is on duty",
      " One situation is that foreign warships and planes are close to the drill area when the Chinese warships and planes are conducting drills",
      " The Chinese military needs to call out to inform them that if they enter the drill area, they will force them to drive away",
      "On the other hand, the PLA navy will also call out foreign warships and aircraft to leave and stay away from sensitive waters, such as the Nansha and Xisha Islands",
      "Song believes the phrase \"an overwhelming sense of security\" shows that the PLA Navy always has the determination and courage to fight and win, regardless of whether the US military sends aircraft carriers or not, or how many aircraft carriers are sent to the South China Sea",
      "It is worth noting that the US 7th Fleet announced on February 12 that the US Navy and Marine Corps, led by the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group and the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit, are conducting joint exercises in the South China Sea",
      " This is the second time this year that the carrier strike group has entered the South China Sea",
      "On January 14, the official account of the PLA Navy also released the latest shots of the Shandong's training in the South China Sea, showing that the carrier, consisting of ships and fighter jets of different types, is preparing for a real combat exercise",
      "Military experts believe that this \"coincidence\" shows the importance of Shandong's deployment in the South China Sea",

      " Illustration: Chen Xia/Global TimesThe pursuit of peace, security and development is common desire of humanity",
      " Unfortunately, it must be acknowledged that the global cyberspace still faces severe challenges and threats",
      " This is mainly because of the irresponsible rogue hegemon, the US",
      " On the one hand, the US continues to abuse its technological advantages to implement unrestricted, uncontrolled and boundaryless comprehensive surveillance worldwide",
      " On the other, it hypocritically talks about the so-called rules-based liberal international order, distorts facts, and attempts to divide the global cyberspace in the name of constructing a new order based on shared values",
      " It poisons and even blocks constructive pragmatic cooperation, dragging the global cyberspace back to the era of digital jungles monopolized by hegemonic power and its cliques",
      "US' comprehensive surveillanceObjectively speaking, the vast majority of international players can understand and comprehend global cyberspace security and development with a pragmatic, rational, objective and constructive attitude",
      " People do not expect a digital utopia to emerge immediately, but at the same time, they sincerely hope that international actors can work together toward the construction of a community with a shared future in cyberspace, making every effort to enable the achievements of the information technology revolution to benefit humanity as much as possible, and jointly exploring and striving for sustainable development models and paths, so as to make tomorrow better than today",
      "However, for the hegemonic power, the information technology revolution since its inception has been a tool for acquiring, strengthening and consolidating its hegemonic advantages",
      " Based on an absolute self-centered unilateral security concept, the US has established a set of absolute security standards that come at the cost of other countries' reasonable security concerns and even core interests",
      " The hegemonic country attempts to gain unilateral, unrestricted, and even absolute freedom of action in the global cyberspace by comprehensively using various means and methods, while unilaterally squeezing the legitimate rights of other countries, including even its loyal allies",
      "In terms of cyberspace practices, the most notable is the US' comprehensive surveillance, which has been evolving and developing since the Cold War to this day in the global cyberspace without boundaries, limits, or bottom lines",
      " In a sense, the goal pursued by such US' measures is to transform global cyberspace into what Western scholar Michel Foucault called a \"Panopticon prison,\" where specific departments and individuals of the hegemonic power become the \"wardens and guards\" in this digital Panopticon prison, who can freely use nearly absolute power to monitor any behavior entities they want to spy on, and no one can escape",
      "The US' actions are considered as digital rogue ones without boundaries, bottom lines, or limits, as there are ample examples showing that the monitoring actions conducted by the US in the global cyberspace far exceed the normal requirements for national security",
      " In some cases, they have reached an alarming level",
      "Disregarding diplomatic etiquette and allies' dignity, the US blatantly monitored the heads of state, leaders of its allies and international organizations, and showed no remorse",
      "Countries such as Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and Israel are crucial political, military and economic allies that the US often boasts about",
      " However, confidential documents disclosed by WikiLeaks showed that even loyal allies cannot escape US surveillance",
      " 125 phone numbers, including those of German political figures such as former chancellor Angela Merkel, were all under the surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA) for decades",
      " In a surveillance operation implemented in October 2011, a meeting between Merkel and then French president Nicolas Sarkozy with the ex-Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was listened in",
      " The NSA also tapped a 2010 conversation between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Berlusconi during which they discussed US-Israel relations and a 2008 meeting between then UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon and German chancellor Angela Merkel on climate change",
      "What is more astonishing is that every time such news is disclosed, the response of American politicians, even the mainstream media, is that \"it proves that American intelligence agencies are doing what they are supposed to do",
      "\" Observers point out that the surveillance reflects the US' habitual \"desire for control\" and \"arrogance to do whatever they want,\" as well as an unspoken but difficult to conceal \"profound distrust of allies",
      "\"The US shamelessly applies double standards, making the monitoring of commercial confidential communication a necessary component of so-called \"fair trade,\" without any sense of business ethics",
      " During the Cold War, the US and its \"Five Eyes\" partners set up a global surveillance system known as \"ECHELON",
      "\" The initial purpose of this system was to serve the signal intelligence collection needs against countries in the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War",
      " However, reports also revealed that the US used it for corporate and industrial espionage as well, gathering sensitive information on European corporations, then turning it over to American competitors so they can gain an economic advantage",
      "It is noteworthy that the US has formed a set of distorted criteria in this process",
      " In the eyes of Washington, monitoring must be maintained to ensure the victory of US companies, and this is not an abuse, but part of normal business competition",
      " However, if US companies lose the competition, those who win must have received \"support from national intelligence\" and \"stolen US trade secrets",
      "\" This set of criteria has repeatedly been applied to Washington's unreasonable attacks against the Chinese government and brutal suppression against Chinese companies since 2015",
      "Cyber bullyThe US monitors ordinary netizens without restraints, intruding upon and collecting a massive amount of personal information with no intelligence value",
      "Human rights and privacy protection are often mentioned by the US government as a justification and value basis for its arbitrary attacks on other countries and governments",
      " However, after Edward Snowden revealed in 2013 that the NSA uses the PRISM program to conduct global surveillance, even mainstream Western media outlets such as The Washington Post have had to admit awkwardly that 90 percent of those being monitored by the NSA were ordinary internet users, rather than those who posed a threat to US national security",
      "According to The Washington Post, after reviewing messages and documents, it was found that most of them were \"useless by the analysts but nonetheless retained, have a startlingly intimate, even voyeuristic quality",
      "\" Neither then president Barack Obama nor his successors such as Donald Trump and Joe Biden used the high standards and strict requirements that the US usually always uses in dealing with other countries' human rights situations to make effective adjustments and changes",
      " Instead, they either resorted to sophistry, rigidly denied, or pretended not to know what happened or as if nothing happened",
      " They then muddled it through without any repentance",
      "At the cost of directly undermining the trust foundation of commercial activities, the US engages in extremely rare supply chain pollution actions",
      "On February 11, 2020, The Washington Post published an in-depth investigative report titled \"The intelligence coup of the century,\" revealing that for more than 50 years, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and West German intelligence service added backdoors into encryption products of a Swiss encryption equipment manufacturer named Crypto AG and used these for intelligence gathering purposes",
      " More than 100 governments around the world, possibly as many as 120, including US allies, purchased and employed the backdoored equipment",
      " These customers had no vigilance or preventive measures against the devices sold by the US, and did not expect that the US would not only have targeted its allies but also dared to adopt supply chain pollution actions that would have a negative impact on the entire industry ecology",
      "What is even more startling is the shameless attitude of the American elites toward such rogue behavior",
      " On March 17, 2000, former CIA director James Woolsey wrote an article titled \"Why we spy on our allies\" in The Wall Street Journal",
      " In an extreme American narcissistic logic, he pointed out that monitoring allies is a necessary precondition to ensure \"fair trade\" opportunities for American companies, because European companies \"bribe\" and are \"more corrupt",
      "\"Obviously, the US has become the main troublemaker for global cyberspace security, stability, and development",
      " Bearing the US' unrestricted, uncontrolled, and boundaryless comprehensive surveillance not only harms the interests of the victims, but also is detrimental to the long-term development of global cyberspace",
      " As one of the main victims, US allies should demonstrate real courage to put rules-based multilateralism and international law in practice, and say \"no\" to the cyber bully",
      " They should take concrete actions to counteract this negative behavior that threatens global cyberspace",
      " Together with all responsible entities, they should take a solid step toward building a community with a shared future in cyberspace that can truly benefit all of humanity",

      "The accusations came after the BBC's offices in India were raided as part of a tax investigation by Indian authorities",
      " However, some British politicians deliberately linked it to India's actions against a BBC documentary known as \"India: The Modi Question\" aired in January",

      " In early 2021, the UK regulator ofcom revoked the broadcast license of the Chinese state broadcaster CGTN in the UK because of its coverage of the Hong Kong protests",
      " When the UK suppressed Chinese media outlets using various excuses, why did it turn a blind eye to the fabrication and neglect of justice of its own media?Song from Fudan University told the Global Times that the West will not reflect on their double standards; in other words, there is no such a word as \"double standards\" in their dictionary",
      "\"Rather, the West believes it is the rightful one",
      " The hostility, extreme prejudice and neglect of professionalism of Western media reflects their arrogance and supremacist mentality,\" said Song",

      "The designation of the balloon as a \"spy\" balloon was one created by officials and relayed by journalists, and never one based on actual empirical evidence",
      " Despite this, the assumption successfully established itself as conventional understanding, showing the power of the US to readily manipulate global discourse with the goal of smearing China",
      " As a show of protest to the events, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken cancelled his upcoming trip to Beijing",
      "The \"spy balloon saga\" is a deliberately orchestrated act of political drama by the US with the goal of purposefully weaponizing fear, paranoia and mass hysteria in the name of discrediting China",
      " American politics, both at home and abroad, is driven by the covert weaponization of \"drama\" in a highly aggressive and hysterical manner, unparalleled throughout the world",
      " In doing so, American politicians and public figures on both sides of the spectrum readily smear each other with highly defamatory and exaggerated allegations, as well as whipping up covert fear, paranoia, and conspiracy theories",
      "As some examples of how this works domestically, Democrats accused Donald Trump of collusion with Russia, Republicans pushed claims the 2021 election was rigged",
      " What is notable about this behaviour is that in each incidence, there is seldom any evidence to support the claims which are pushed, yet they otherwise become conventional understanding in the respective political camp",
      " What it also goes to show is that in recent decades, US political polarization has become inherently worse",
      " The country has become more divided and as such the scale of dramatized political conflict has only increased",
      "However, beyond domestic politics, this weaponization of fear and paranoia has already been a longstanding trait of US foreign policy, except it has been less notable as foreign affairs are subject to an elite consensus and relayed through the media",
      " Washington deliberately ferments mass hysteria and paranoia to manufacture support for its foreign policy goals, and the US public as a majority tend to follow this manipulation",
      " Usually, this involves depicting a particular country or ideology as a critical threat to the security and values of the US, and again there is often an absence of evidence to go with it",
      "While the term \"McCarthyism\" comes to mind, the most explicit example of all is the claim Saddam's Iraq possessed \"weapons of mass destruction\" and was a critical threat to the US",
      " Hence now, the US has designated China as \"the enemy\", and therefore mass paranoia is cultivated pertaining to all things China within the United States, usually used selectively as part of the US's economic war against the country",
      " For example, a recent \"think-tank\" published a report claiming that Chinese manufactured fridges and other household consumer products could be engaging in \"espionage\"",
      " These claims often follow a very dubious \"guilt by association\" logic, and are used to legitimate sanctions in the name of US protectionism",
      "However, the \"spy balloon saga\" is not just a product of foreign policy choices, but a dangerous by-product of how growing domestic polarization is leading to greater foreign policy destabilization",
      " In other words, the toxicity of the American domestic scene is preventing the administration from taking a pragmatic, stable and reasonable approach to China because it is obligated to \"appear tough,\" therefore its decision making is fundamentally irrational",
      " Once the news of the balloon was published, the usual mass hysteria was amplified by US politicians, which subsequently gave the administration no place to hide save it took a \"tough\" approach, this meant cancelling diplomacy and shooting it down for optics",
      " The product is that despite Blinken talking of so-called \"guardrails\", it is the US who is destabilizing the bilateral relationship at the whim of domestic political pressures, and it is precisely this reason why all engagement the US has pursued with China has not had any practical effects, and why such meetings are often followed or pre-empted with sanctions",
      "In conclusion, the toxicity of US domestic politics is proving to be a dangerous destabilizing force",
      " America is lockstepped into a paranoid, aggression and uncompromising approach by China, and there is no way for the Biden administration to escape it",
      " This is a testament to how US style democracy, utilizing mass drama, hysteria, misinformation and smear tactics, is an inherently dangerous and unstable system which is exporting its problems to the rest of the world",

      "Today, our world, our times and history are changing in ways like never before, and the international community is confronted with multiple risks and challenges rarely seen before",
      " Regional security hotspots keep flaring up, local conflicts and turbulence occur frequently, the COVID-19 pandemic persists, unilateralism and protectionism have risen significantly, and traditional and non-traditional security threats are entwined",

      " It is also one brimming with hope",
      " We are convinced that the historical trends of peace, development and win-win cooperation are unstoppable",
      " Upholding world peace and security and promoting global development and prosperity should be the common pursuit of all countries",
      " Chinese President Xi Jinping has proposed the Global Security Initiative (GSI), calling on countries to adapt to the profoundly changing international landscape in the spirit of solidarity, and address the complex and intertwined security challenges with a win-win mindset",
      " The GSI aims to eliminate the root causes of international conflicts, improve global security governance, encourage joint international efforts to bring more stability and certainty to a volatile and changing era, and promote durable peace and development in the world",

      " Core concepts and principles1",

      " In 2014, President Xi Jinping initiated a new vision for common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, which has been widely recognized and supported by the international community",
      " The essence of this new vision of security is to advocate a concept of common security, respecting and safeguarding the security of every country; a holistic approach, maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains and enhancing security governance in a coordinated way; a commitment to cooperation, bringing about security through political dialogue and peaceful negotiation; and pursuit of sustainable security, resolving conflicts through development and eliminating the breeding ground for insecurity",
      " We believe security will only be firmly established and sustainable when it is underpinned by morality, justice and the right ideas",

      " Stay committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries",
      " Sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs are basic principles of international law and the most fundamental norms governing contemporary international relations",
      " We believe all countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal members of the international community",
      " Their internal affairs brook no external interference, their sovereignty and dignity must be respected, and their right to independently choose social systems and development paths must be upheld",

      " They are humanity's institutional design for collective security and lasting peace",
      " The various confrontations and injustices in the world today did not occur because the purposes and principles of the UN Charter are outdated, but because they are not effectively maintained and implemented",
      " We call on all countries to practice true multilateralism; firmly uphold the international system with the UN at its core, the international order underpinned by international law and the basic norms of international relations underpinned by the UN Charter; and uphold the authority of the UN and its status as the main platform for global security governance",

      "These six commitments are interlinked and mutually reinforcing, and are an organic whole of dialectical unity",
      " Among them, the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security provides conceptual guidance; respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries is the basic premise; abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter is a primary benchmark; taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously is an important principle, peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation is a must choice; and maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains is an inherent requirement",

      " Photo:XinhuaChina stands firmly against \"long-arm jurisdiction\" practices, said Wang Chao, spokesperson for the first session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC), at a press conference on Saturday, stressing that it is totally justifiable and necessary for China to make legislation effort to counter containment, suppression and interference from external forces",
      "\"Some countries have kept abusing the extraterritorial application of their domestic laws in violation of the international law, with the aim of suppressing foreign entities and individuals and serving their own interests,\" said Wang",
      "\"Such bullying acts are widely criticized in the international community",
      " China stands firmly against such practices,\" he said",
      "The spokesperson made the remarks while answering a question from a foreign journalist about China's \"Foreign Relations Law,\" after the NPC made the draft law public in 2022",
      " This law is a basic law in the field of foreign affairs, and it is necessary to make provisions on countermeasures and restrictive measures in principle, Wang said",
      "Experts said that in recent years the US is getting increasingly unpredictable and aggressive in imposing unfair and unlawful sanctions, tariffs, restrictions and embargos against Chinese institutions and companies, especially those with technological potential and advantages",
      " These hegemonic and hostile acts with pretext of ideology and \"national security\" will definitely lead to China taking action to protect its own development and interests, and the legislation is a crucial part of these efforts",
      "\"To counter the containment, suppression and interference of its internal affairs, China has introduced a number of laws and regulations including the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law to block improper extraterritorial application of foreign laws and measures,\" Wang said",
      "China's core interests allow no infringement, and its sovereignty and territorial integrity shall be inviolable",
      " China introduces relevant provisions into law to firmly counter the acts that undermine China's sovereignty, security and development interests and harm the lawful rights and interests of Chinese nationals, the spokesperson said",
      " \"This is both justifiable and necessary,\" Wang stressed",
      "Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Sunday that the legislation agenda linked to the \"the Foreign Relations Law\" reflects that China's policymaking on foreign affairs will be more law-based to better reconcile domestic laws with the international law",

      "Some Western voices said the legislation of \"Foreign Relations Law\" shows that China's diplomacy will be \"more aggressive",
      "\" Li said such accusation is totally nonsense and ridiculous",
      "\"It was the US diplomacy and foreign actions that are getting increasingly ruthless and shameless, as Washington continually impose 'long-arm jurisdiction' and unilateral sanctions to unfairly attack other countries' companies and even force its allies to arrest other countries' personnel without legal basis",
      " If someone is able to protect itself from US aggression and even able to fight back, then it will surely be accused by the Western voices,\" he noted",

      "(Photo: Xinhua)The earthquakes in Turkey are likely to have geopolitical and economic spillover effects including those on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and Europe's energy security, Chinese observers said",
      " The disaster has so far resulted in over 12,000 deaths and about 63,000 injuries",
      "The 7",
      "7-magnitude and 7",
      "6-magnitude quakes, with the Turkish province of Kahramanmaras as the epicenter, have affected 13 million people in 10 provinces, according to the Turkish Embassy in Beijing",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan observed the ongoing search and rescue efforts and the disaster relief work on Wednesday, and paid visits to the survivors, saying Turkey has mobilized all its resources for the aftermath of the earthquake",
      "Since the earthquake struck, condolences have poured in from around the world to express solidarity with Turkey, with many countries sending rescue teams and assistance to the country",
      "Turkey's geopolitical status has come to the fore since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the earthquake relief work may distract Erdogan from his role as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine, Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Thursday",
      " He noted that the disaster will present a test to the Erdogan administration's governance capability",
      "Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin have spoken repeatedly since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and Turkey has acted as mediator alongside the United Nations to set up a deal allowing grain exports from Ukrainian ports",
      "Also, the aftermath of the earthquake could also affect energy security in Europe, Wang said",
      "Since the Ukraine crisis began, discussions have been held on the construction of gas pipelines passing through Turkey reaching Europe",
      " However, such strong earthquakes could force people to rethink the possibility of the instability of seismic zones in Turkey and may affect the directions of future energy channels in the long run, Wang noted",

      " Photo: VCGSince the very beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict a year ago, one of the prime goals of the West was to isolate Moscow in the international system",
      " To achieve this goal, it was not good enough to sustain the newly acquired Western cohesion; the real challenge was to bring to the \"right side of history\" as many nations of the Global South as possible",
      " If the West were to succeed in this undertaking, Russia would become a truly \"pariah state",
      "\"However, this mission has turned out to be impossible to accomplish",
      " Over the last year, in the Global South, as a rule, countries do not subscribe to the US or the EU anti-Russian sanctions",
      " These countries have voiced opposition to expelling Moscow from important multilateral international organizations and forums and continue to host high-level delegations from Moscow and sign new agreements on cooperation with their business partners from Russia",
      " In sum, the Global South so far has demonstrated a spectacular resilience in its commitment to stay out of the escalating conflict between Russia and the West",
      "This persistent resistance to the continuous pressure from the West calls for explanations",
      " One of such explanations is a wide spread perception in the Global South that the Western approach to Ukraine is a clear manifestation of double standards",
      " Not only did the West almost completely fail to resolve many bloody conflicts outside the Euro-Atlantic space, for instance, in Yemen or in Ethiopia, but it should even take direct responsibility for at least some of them such as Iraq and Libya",
      " The sharp contrast between how Europe treats Ukrainian refugees and how it handled refugees from Syria a couple of years ago also suggests that the \"universal\" Western human rights\" policies are in reality quite selective and biased",
      "Another explanation is that in the West the ongoing conflict in Ukraine is often presented as a part of the global clash between \"good democracies\" and \"bad autocracies,\" as yet another crusade in defense of Western liberal values against the Eastern despotism",
      " The fact is that many nations in Africa, Middle East and Southeast Asia can hardly fit the Western \"democratic\" standards; these nations were not even invited to the virtual Summit for Democracy hosted by the Biden administration in the end of 2021",
      " So, why should these \"disqualified\" nations in the Global South stand by the principles of the club that they have not been admitted to?Still, the most important reason for the Global South not to align with the West seems to be another one",
      " The reality is that the West does not seem to be in any way interested in inviting the Global South to discuss the Ukraine crisis together in any depth in order to find an appropriate balanced and long-lasting solution",
      " Instead, the West implicitly or explicitly suggests that the Global South should simply subscribe to all the positions already carved in stone by Western leaders, in particular, by the Biden administration in US",
      " Nations in the Global South are looked upon not as full-fledged decision-makers, but rather as obedient decision-takers",
      " Such one-sided views on how international problems should be addressed remind of the turn of the century unipolar world, in which the rules of the game were set almost exclusively by the White House",
      " Needless to say, this is not a very appealing vision of the future world order for aspiring nations in the Global South trying to position themselves not as speechless objects, but as vocal subjects of global politics",
      "This is not to say that the Global South has not been affected by the crisis or that it has no stakes in the crisis resolution",
      " The escalating conflict does have multiple implications for the international system at large, including global and regional security, international trade and finance",
      " It distracts the attention of great powers from addressing such burning matters as climate change, food and energy security to less developed nations and many others",
      "On the other hand, the crisis has turned into an opportunity for leading actors in the Global South to demonstrate that they have their own agendas in global affairs, including their multiple proposals on managing various dimensions of the Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      " It is not surprising to observe such proposals coming not only from major developing countries like China and India, but also from emerging regional leaders like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Indonesia",
      "The resolution of the crisis might well trigger long-awaited reforms in the global order, which should imply, among other things, a more prominent role for the Global South in the international system",
      " That would arguably be the only silver lining in the cloudy and stormy international atmosphere of today",

      " Photo: VCGEditor's Note:The Russia-Ukraine conflict is approaching its one-year mark, with no end in sight",
      " It is eating up scarce European resources, preventing millions of refugees from returning home and weakening the global economic outlook while the US and some European countries are fanning the flames of the war, keeping sending weapons to Ukraine",
      " How will the Russia-Ukraine conflict end? What are the biggest stumbling blocks for negotiation and diplomatic resolution?In an interview with Global Times (GT) reporter Yu Jincui, Sevim Dagdelen (Dagdelen), Chairwoman of the Left Party parliamentary group in the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the German Bundestag and Spokeswoman for international relations and disarmament, said what dominates in NATO countries now is a military logic driven by a war-hungry political and media elite that is focused on the illusory and highly dangerous aim of military victory over Russia",
      " \"We need to put a spanner in the works for the warmongers,\" she said",
      " Dagdelen also claimed EU countries have acted as servile vassals of the US and at the same time endangering their own populations",
      "This is the second installment of the series",
      "GT: What's your prediction for the Russia-Ukraine conflict this year? What is the biggest obstacle to a diplomatic solution?Dagdelen: Things have developed to a point where the US is now conducting a proxy war against Russia in Ukraine, with the help of its NATO allies",
      " NATO's war aim is evidently to destroy Russia by supplying increasingly heavy weapons to Ukraine and by waging an economic war on Russia",
      " The West torpedoed the talks between Russia and Ukraine in 2022 and still appears to have no interest in a negotiated settlement, instead aiming on the continuation of the war until victory over Russia",
      " The longer the war in Ukraine goes on, the greater are not only the suffering and the immense costs on all sides but also the danger of further escalation, ultimately including nuclear war",
      "The greatest obstacle to a diplomatic solution resides in the failure of the NATO countries' governments to speak honestly about their war aims",
      " Rather than working toward a ceasefire in the spirit of the talks in Istanbul last March - which failed because the West, especially the US and UK, withdrew their support, as former Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett recently confirmed in an interview - what dominates here in Germany, like in other NATO countries, is a military logic driven by a war-hungry political and media elite that is focused on the illusory and highly dangerous aim of military victory over Russia",
      " The discourse surrounding the German government's decision to expand its military support and send Leopard heavy battle tanks is an expression of that",
      " You can imagine what it means in Russia to have German battle tanks once again being sent to war against that country",
      "GT: You said Germany's decision to send main battle tanks to Ukraine is a \"historic mistake,\" but there are also voices calling for more and better weapons for Ukraine",
      " What's your take on this? How will the weapons provided by the West influence the Russia-Ukraine conflict?Dagdelen: Supplying heavy battle tanks, which Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz had previously considered a red line, is another breach of taboo and an extremely dangerous escalation",
      " Taken in response to massive pressure from the US, the decision paves the way to making Germany more and more of a party to the conflict and sending it into the line of fire against Russia",
      " The German government is acting here as a willing vassal to the US administration and thereby giving up all its leeway for independent foreign and security policy",
      " Berlin is thus also bowing down to the US' decades-old strategic ambition to prevent cooperation between Germany and Russia for the long term",
      "What is more, the decision lays the foundations for a dangerous game of one-upmanship on weapons supplies",
      " No sooner had Scholz's government given way on supplying Leopard heavy battle tanks than Ukraine was pushing for deliveries of fighter jets, submarines and ballistic missiles - a demand that is being repeated by political actors and journalists in Germany",
      " We must at all costs avoid sliding further down that dangerous slope toward a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia",
      " Surveys suggest that around three in four people in Germany are afraid of the Ukraine war spreading and want the West to enter into negotiations about bringing it to an end",
      " The broad majority want diplomacy rather than escalation, and the German government should finally take that desire seriously",
      "GT: As the war approaches its first anniversary, who do you think has been the biggest beneficiary? Are more and more Europeans waking up to the US role in this crisis? Has their perception about the war been changed?Dagdelen: The effects of the war in Ukraine and the West's economic war against Russia are dramatic",
      " This is especially true for the countries of the Global South, which are suffering greatly from the skyrocketing food and energy prices",
      " In Europe and above all in Germany, the nonsensical economic war is tantamount to economic self-amputation",
      " While the sanctions are failing in their objective to stop the war in Ukraine, never mind destroy the Russian economy, the German economy slid into a recession at the end of last year",
      " The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is even predicting more economic growth for Russia in 2023 than for Germany",
      " In Germany, workers in particular have been hit hard by the effects of sanctions, suffering a 5 percent loss in real earnings at the end of last year - the worst in the history of the Federal Republic - as a result of the skyrocketing food and energy prices caused by the sanctions",
      " At the same time, energy companies are making record profits, and the militarization of Germany at the expense of social spending is bringing with it an upward redistribution of wealth",
      " With the Western alliance too, a massive shift is taking place in favor of the US, which is attacking Europe as a centre of industry with its multi-billion-dollar program of industrial subsidies",
      " The US wants to strengthen its economy at the expense of its European and Asian allies, especially Germany and Japan, and simultaneously push both of them to the sharp end of escalation with Russia and China",
      "GT: Chair of the NATO Military Committee Rob Bauer said that the US-led NATO is ready for a direct confrontation with Russia recently",
      " To what extent do you think NATO will directly engage in the Russia-Ukraine war? There is a view that NATO's full involvement will trigger World War III",
      " What do you think?Dagdelen: De facto, with its comprehensive military, intelligence and economic support for Ukraine, NATO is already a conflict party",
      " Ukraine is being treated as a de facto member of NATO",
      " There is a realistic danger that NATO, by supplying increasingly heavy weapons in ever greater numbers, will get itself into active involvement in the war, with the deployment of troops and direct military confrontation with Russia at the end of it",
      " So far, involvement has been limited to what they call volunteer units",
      " Worryingly, nationalists from NATO countries, and Al Qaeda groups dedicated to caliphate states, are treated as welcome guests in Ukraine because of their support for the war",
      " NATO is veritably incubating a global security threat there",
      "We are engaged in a dangerous game of one-upmanship on weapons supplies, in which, following the decision to supply battle tanks, people are already calling for deliveries of fighter jets, war ships and ballistic missiles or even nuclear weapons",
      " To stop the war expanding into a Third World War and a nuclear Armageddon, we must break away from the military logic of escalation and find a diplomatic route out of the conflict",
      " We need to put a spanner in the works for the warmongers",
      "GT: You said EU members have become \"servile vassals\" that are \"pursuing the interests of US corporations and following foreign policy instructions from Washington",
      "\" Although the EU has always emphasized strategic autonomy, why is it still unable to guarantee its strategic autonomy?Dagdelen: The proxy war in Ukraine demonstrates that the EU has not managed to liberate itself from the dominance of the US and pursue an independent, self-assured foreign and security policy",
      " Germany is acting as a servile vassal of the US and at the same time endangering its own population",
      " At the same time, Berlin is abandoning a foreign policy that can be taken seriously",
      " The climax of European powerlessness in its feudal relationship with the US has been the refusal to investigate the terrorist acts of sabotage against the Russia-Germany Nord Stream pipelines",
      "In February last year, US President Joe Biden already announced that they would be destroyed in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine",
      " The German government has been stonewalling and is still refusing to provide any information, even to Parliament, on investigations into this unparalleled attack on Germany's energy sovereignty",
      " Particularly in light of the recent revelations by US investigative journalist and Pulitzer Prize winner Seymour Hersh, according to which the US and Norway blew up the Nord Stream pipelines, the German government must finally provide clarification about the perpetrators and draw appropriate consequences instead of continuing this vassal loyalty",
      "As in the case of the Nord Stream pipelines, in the history leading up to Russia war actions against Ukraine, a key factor is the US' ambition to prevent a common security order in Europe that would include Russia",
      " As practically voiceless stooges to the US, the EU countries were not in a position to find a diplomatic solution to prevent military escalation in the Ukraine conflict",
      " We have to assume that the violation of international law by former German chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Macron with regard to the Minsk agreement was agreed beforehand with the US",
      " The Russian side had evidently just been kept waiting to gain time in which to arm Ukraine",
      " Even after Russia's attack began, the EU could not manage, in its own interest, to work for an end to the war via a negotiating initiative and ceasefire talks",
      " Instead, the EU countries are going along with the strategy of sending Europe and especially Germany - just like Japan vis-\u00e0-vis China - into Russia's line of fire",
      " If we can take the sound defense of one's own population as a measure of political intelligence, then we in Germany have the stupidest government, for it is consciously harming the interests of its own population and accepting the downfall of the German economy as the price of Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock's stated objective, \"ruining Russia",
      "\"Such a strategy is looking more and more like dangerous adventurism",
      " Just like a roulette player, it means responding to ever greater losses by raising the stakes and eventually playing for all or nothing",
      " It is that attitude, coupled with a dangerous sense of supposed moral superiority in combination with hard-bitten geopolitics, which is betting on a foreign policy that is, apparently untrammeled by history, conjuring up the ghosts of German history",
      "GT: Under the current situation, what should the EU do to help prevent the escalation of the situation while at the same time protecting the EU's own interests? Do China and the EU have a common interest in preventing the escalation of the situation in Ukraine?Dagdelen: The EU, at NATO's side, is betting on victory over Russia in the war in Ukraine and is in the process of ruining itself",
      " While Ukraine is being fattened up with weapons that will end up being used in wars around the world, our own population is facing the threat of massive social decline",
      " The EU is no longer able to serve the interests of its own population",
      " It is behaving like Latin America in the 1970s, as a force led by comprador bourgeoisies that is willingly letting the US drive it into escalating confrontation with Russia",
      " Everything suggests that the same will apply in respect of China and that those forces will prevail in the EU, who are seeking to destroy our relations with China even though this will mean our own industrial downfall",
      " In light of this there would actually be a shared interest in ending the war in Ukraine, but the EU is no longer capable of formulating that interest",
      "GT: Recently, NATO Secretary-General visited South Korea and Japan and China was high on the agenda",
      " In your opinion, does NATO aim for building an \"Asia-Pacific version of NATO?\" If NATO really expands eastward to the Asia-Pacific, what impact will it have on Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and the world?Dagdelen: The West's military policy of expansion and confrontation vis-\u00e0-vis China has vast potential for escalation",
      " It includes, first and foremost, massive expansion of military cooperation with Japan on the part of the US and NATO in the course of that country's unprecedented armament and militarization",
      " What Germany's armament in Europe is against Russia is reflected in Japan's armament against China at the urging of the USA",
      " In both countries, a certain amnesia about history seems to be running riot among the elite",
      " It is shocking how the US is more or less openly preparing for possible war against China, not least with weapons supplies to allies and yet more military bases in the region",
      " Europe and Germany would be well advised to have no part in it or in the associated militarization of the Indo-Pacific",
      "However, I am concerned to see Germany's policy guidelines for the Indo-Pacific being implemented and the German government drawing up a China strategy, which unfortunately goes in entirely the wrong direction",
      " Rather than going along with the US as it strives for geopolitical hegemony behind the smokescreen of a supposed systemic rivalry between \"democracies\" and \"autocracies,\" the EU and its member states should pursue foreign and security policy built on the desire for peaceful coexistence through diplomacy, reconciliation of interests, arms control and disarmament",

      "Shenyang, with a population of more than nine million in Northeast China's Liaoning Province, released a plan in February to promote long-term and balanced population development",

      "It mainly aims to provide service support for childbirth to build universal care service system, while supportive measures including the extension of leave and subsidies are to provide time and economic support, which are both important to \"boost the confidence in childbirth,\" Song Jian, a demographer from the Center for Population and Development Studies of the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Thursday",
      "However, different regions should avoid comparisons, as it doesn't mean that the more money or the more leave time you give out, the better the effect will be, Song said",
      "For instance, long leave will weaken the competitiveness of women in the labor market, and it is not conducive to win the recognition of enterprises, on particularly in facing fierce competition, according to Song",
      " Song suggested that a comprehensive cost-sharing mechanism should be considered to all the parties concerned, in order to avoid discrimination against women",

      " The crumbling of the US' infrastructure is the tragedy of American politics today, and a symptom of the country's declining governance capabilities",

      " The US federalism lacks a national coordination mechanism, which is affected by factors such as mutual restraints between the federal government and states as well as the vicious development of its two-party system",
      "Furthermore, about 85 percent of the US' critical infrastructure is in the hands of the private sector, with the pursuit of profit rather than the provision of public goods and services as the primary goal",
      " This results in a lack of effective motivation for infrastructure maintenance and construction",
      "Even though the Biden administration in November 2021 signed the infrastructure plan into law, which would put $550 billion in new funds into transportation, broadband and utilities, the plan is progressing slowly",
      " There is a significant gap with the efficiency of building infrastructure in comparison with China",

      " The opening of egg freezing may also lead to the commercial transaction, breaking moral principles",
      "Lu said relevant departments and experts should discuss the safety concerns of opening egg-freezing and could make pilot programs in certain places, such as Hainan Free Trade Port and Boao Lecheng pilot zone of international medical tourism, to sum up experience and decide to loose or tighten relevant rules before making a safer policy",

      " Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China showed that the population has decreased by a total of 850,000",

      " He declared that China must now understand that \"the US is staying in this region - we're the leader in this region in many ways",
      "\"What the US politician said implies two messages",
      " First, he seems to criticize China for not understanding US' presence in the Asia-Pacific",
      " Second, Burns wants Beijing to acknowledge Washington's leadership in the region",
      " Yet, both are far from the truth",
      "Washington has always had the strategic miscalculation\uff1aIt believes Beijing wants to push it out of the Asia-Pacific region",
      " But China not only recognizes US' presence in the area, but also seeks peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation with the US on the premise of mutual respect",
      " What Beijing refuses is to be led by anyone else, including Washington",
      "Burns' words are extremely US-centric, as they come entirely from Washington's perspective of its regional role while ignoring the actual opinions of other Asia-Pacific nations",
      " Such arrogance aims to satisfy the US' strategic need for maintaining global hegemony",
      "\"US continues to live in an alternative reality fuelled by hubris,\" one tweet said, commenting on Burns' remarks",
      " This hits the nail on the head regarding US' current status",
      "Washington has to understand that most Asia-Pacific countries do not want to be stuck in a Cold War-like confrontation again, nor do they want to see conflicts between major powers",
      " The US' desire to lead regional affairs and get the recognition of other countries is wishful thinking, which is completely at odds with the trend of development in Asia-Pacific",
      "Besides, against the backdrop of the deteriorating domestic problems and the relative decline in US' national power, there's also a sense of lack of confidence in Burns' remarks: In fact, it actually sounds like a self-affirmation the US has to make",
      "\"In the past, the US could confidently intervene in the affairs of any region and use force or coercion to maintain its leadership",
      " But now it is increasingly incapable of acting as a leader, because Washington finds it more difficult to focus on other regions,\" Zhang Tengjun, deputy director of the Department for Asia-Pacific Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times",
      "Almost one year in office, Burns has increasingly fueled the deterioration of China-US relations",
      " As Washington's megaphone for Beijing, the ambassador has frequently criticized China's policies in public, including on social media",
      " Many of his comments are damaging to US-China relations and inappropriate to his ambassadorship",
      "For instance, an exclusive report by the Global Times on Monday noted that Burns recently sparked discontent among the attendees of the 22nd Annual Appreciation Dinner American Chamber of Commerce when he criticized China in his address to the event",
      "The US Ambassador to China is the executor of US policy toward China",
      " After taking office, Burns has been following Washington's order on many China-related issues tightly and expressing what the White House wants him to say",
      " Therefore, it is easy to see that Burns' actions of fueling the fire essentially stem from the hysteria of the US' containment policy toward China",
      "Over the past year, it seems that condemning China has become an instinctive reaction of any US official when dealing with China, especially in the current US political environment that promotes anti-China sentiments",
      "Nevertheless, politicians like Burns should understand that \"pride and prejudice\" toward China will only bring more danger and chaos to the region and the world",
      " No matter how harsh they want to sound when talking about China and how assertive when talking about the US, they can never fool other countries by trying to sugarcoat US hegemony as \"leadership",
