Criteria may vary, but in general it is hard to disagree that Beijing has been the primary beneficiary - at least in terms of the transformation of the country and its place on the international stage. Deng Xiaoping's strategy of quiet, gradual ascent was entirely in the Chinese spirit, and the result has undoubtedly been justified.", "So much so that it was extremely difficult for Beijing to understand that this super favorable and advantageous situation would come to an end.", "This proved inevitable for one simple reason: China has acquired a power that, whatever its wishes and intentions, makes it a potential rival to the US. And this has led to a natural evolution of the American approach to Beijing. After all, the US style is the direct opposite of the classic Chinese style described above. And the latter's attempts in the late 2010s and early 2020s to slow down the growing American pressure have run up against Washington's firm intention to move the relationship into the category of strategic competition. To be fair, China's assertiveness and self-confidence were also growing, but if everything had depended on Beijing alone, the period of beneficial cooperation would have lasted several more years.", "Be that as it may, a new era has dawned. China's diplomatic revival is intended to demonstrate that Beijing is not afraid to play a role in world politics. The form of engagement so far bears the hallmarks of the previous period and of that very traditional approach - the sterile precision of the wording of Chinese peace proposals on the Ukraine issue is evidence of this. But this too is likely to change. China's desire to maintain an outwardly well intentioned neutrality suits Moscow; it is the West that is quick to allege insincerity, and to do so in a tone that is unbecoming of the Chinese. Beijing should not be expected to make a sharp U-turn, which is also contrary to its sense of propriety, but the direction is set.", "And it is not a question of whether China shares Russia's assessment of what is happening in Ukraine. Beijing has carefully avoided expressing an opinion because it does not consider it to be its business. But the realignment of forces on the world stage is taking its course, with China and Russia, whether they like it or not, on one side and the United States and its allies on the other. And from now on this will become increasingly clear.

The former implies a self-sufficient harmony, while the latter tends to be outward-looking as much as inward-looking.

Meanwhile, the businesses do not seem negatively affected by the change. In fact, they seem to be flourishing like never before. So where exactly is the problem?", "It seems that much of the skepticism and even paranoia about 15-minute cities stems from recent history, particularly humanity's experience with the Covid pandemic and the restrictive methods that some world leaders chose for dealing with it.

Traffic cameras will monitor compliance and fines will be imposed for violations.", "The aforementioned 'conspiracy theorists' in Oxford have been accused of conflating the two plans to make the idea of the 15-minute city seem more ominous than it is.

But over the country's thousand-year history, the system has undergone major changes.", "At the dawn of the existence of Rus, the Slavic tribes that populated the land that would become Russia had no army of their own. Whenever conflicts became violent, they resembled 'wall on wall' fist fights. These confrontations continued in this manner until the Slavs learned the art of war from their northern neighbors and colonizers - the Varangians.", "The Varangian guard, which took control of the trade route that passed through central Rus to the Greek civilizations, called themselves 'rowers', since they used row boats in their military campaigns. It is thought that the ancient Scandinavian word \"r\u014d\u00fer\" at some point evolved into the similar sounding 'rus'. It's highly likely that the future name of Russia thus sprang from the self-designated name of the Varangian warriors.", "The people of Rus wore simple shirts and helmets. They were mainly armed with spears and axes, while a sword marked a warrior's superior status. They fought on foot, moving along rivers on boats called drakkars, which were rolled over rapids. The Varangians engaged in the great Viking tradition of trade and raids - pretty much the same as in Western Europe at the time.", "One of the most famous Varangians and first rulers of Rus was Grand Prince Svyatoslav, who fought Bulgaria, the Byzantine Empire, and the Khazar khaganate. Some sources mention large raids as far away from the center of Rus as the southern Caspian lands.", "As the ancient Russian principalities were established, grew more powerful, and formed a settled economy, the Varangian-Rus people increasingly assimilated. In their turn, the Slavs adopted Varangian methods of warfare. This process, along with the need to protect the territories under their control, resulted in the formation of a new kind of military organization - the princely vigilante squad.", "These were boyar warriors from among the prince's loyal inner circle. They equipped themselves with war horses, armor, pikes, and swords at their own expense. In military campaigns, the unit was accompanied by a foot detachment of 200-300 spearmen. These combat groups were quite mobile and were able to quickly respond to the raids of the Polovtsians and Pechenegs. Unfortunately, by the time of the Mongol invasion, these detachments had not sufficiently evolved - still small in number and dispersed, they could not effectively fight the horde from the East.", "Despite the defeat by the Mongols, the vigilantes and local militias continued fighting during the internecine wars of the 14th and 15th centuries, until a single state was formed under Ivan the Terrible.", "It was then that the first unified regular army appeared in Russia, called the Streltsy. This reform occurred in 1550 and a special order (ministry) was created. This first army wasn't large - it consisted of no more than 3,000soldiers. However, the Streltsy were paid and were not obliged to work the land, which greatly facilitated social mobility in those days. The privileges, allowance, and a rather free lifestyle made the new profession extremely popular, and within 50 years, there were over 20,000 Streltsy in Moscow and the regions.", "The Streltsy wore a kaftan and gloves and had uniform weapons. They were armed with a \"bardishe\" (poleaxe with a long shaft), a \"pischal\" (the Russian equivalent of an arquebus or long gun), and a saber. To achieve greater firing accuracy during important battles, the shaft of a bardishe was used to support the pischal. The Streltsy also often carried low-power powder grenades.", "In addition to military duties, the Streltsy had civic duties, acting as policemen and firemen, They also often interacted with the local cavalry. In battle the Streltsy were directly responsible for the capture of Kazan (1552) and Astrakhan (1556), and most importantly, the retention of these territories.", "After the fall of the Rurik dynasty and the onset of the Smuta (The Time of Troubles), Russia was forced to adapt and change its military system because of the prolonged war with Poland and the occupation of Russia's northern territories by Sweden. To fight the occupation, \"foreign formation regiments\" were organized. These military units were made up of servicemen, \"willing\" free people, foreigners, Cossacks, and other mercenaries.", "The new regiments did not replace the Streltsy but used more modern tactics to fight. This included the placement of pikemen in front of the musketeers, which increased the tactical manoeuvrability of combat detachments.", "By the 1630s, the foreign formation regiments had evolved into the first Hussar and Reiter companies. These were in fact knights with long pistols. They wore cuirasses and helmets, but when attacking, they fired dozens of heavy bullets at the enemy and then either retreated to reload or finished the enemy off with daggers and these meter-long pistols.", "Although the Hussar and Reiter regiments were quite effective, they still weren't large enough. The Streltsy, who took on the role of a mass army, unfortunately engaged in a dispute with the young Tsar Peter I. The conflict prefaced large-scale military reform. In 1705, the future emperor and founder of the Russian Empire issued a decree \"On the recruitment of soldiers from free people\". It was then that the term \"recruit\" was legally endorsed. Peter I \"copied\" this innovation from Sweden, which had a strong regular army.", "The decree stated that from each village, town, community, and household, one person (except for the head of the family and the breadwinner) must be sent to the army for a lifetime of service and must become a soldier. This person was to be chosen by lot. In the early years of the law, all classes were subject to conscription. All nobles were obliged to serve in the army, and communities were required to regularly provide a certain number of recruits between the ages of 20-35.", "In addition to the professional army, Peter I also established the Russian navy, military industry, and military academies.", "By the end of Peter the Great's reign, the regular army numbered 200,000 to 300,000 in all military service branches. This was an impressive number for a country with a population of 13 million. The duration of military service also became shorter over time. Lifetime military service was dispensed with, and soldiers went into \"reserve\", being called to the army only in case of war. However, for many decades the duration of military service didn't drop below 20 years.", "The next major reform of the Russian army took place in the 19th century. Any defeat brings with it necessary lessons, and such was the case with the Crimean War, which resulted in Milyutin's sweeping reforms. The main innovation was the transition from Peter the Great's recruitment system to universal military service - a standard practice in European armies. From that time on, all men between the ages of 21 and 40 were required to be on active military duty. In the ground forces, the duration of service was 15 years: six years of active service and nine years in reserve. After that, men were enlisted in the State Militia (the reserve of the armed forces, convened only in case of war) until they turned 40.", "Additionally, instead of permanent armies and corps, Milyutin formed military districts with stationed units. This meant that soldiers and officers no longer had to permanently live in tents.", "The second half of the 19th century was also marked by qualitative changes. Particular attention was paid to the army's technical equipment. The end of the century saw the development of aeronautical and railway units. In 1885, a team of military aeronauts was formed (using hot air balloons or airships), with the East Siberian Field Aeronautical Battalion taking part in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. In 1911, the first aviation detachment appeared in Russia, and by the beginning of the First World War, there were 39 such groups. The famous \"Ilya Muromets\" heavy bombers also appeared at that time.", "In those years, state-owned factories and logistics expanded, all combat units were equipped with machine guns, and telephone lines were installed between the various units.", "Fundamental changes also concerned military service admission. The term of active service in the infantry and foot artillery was three years, in other branches of the ground forces it was four years, and in the Navy, it was five. Some categories of citizens were given privileges. Men who were unable to carry weapons for health reasons and some clergy were exempt from military service.", "In the first months after the October Revolution of 1917, the Soviet government sought to create an army based on the militia system. This supposed that during peacetime, military units would consist only of the accounting apparatus and limited command staff, drawing upon locally registered fighters in times of need.", "In the first months following the revolution, the army was composed of volunteers with the number of troops reaching just below 200 thousand. In order to create a regular army, the resolution \"On the organization of the Red Army\" was adopted on July 10, 1918. Men from 18 to 40 years old were subject to conscription and by November 1921, the Red Army numbered 5.5 million.", "Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union became a real test for the army, and the Soviet military system was not ready for it.

At the start of February, it seemed that Defense Minister Alexei Reznikov would become the ultimate victim of the purge. His imminent departure was openly discussed in the Ukrainian parliament and hints were even dropped by the President's office.", "His possible resignation was also discussed in leading internationalmedia. However, just two weeks later, the threat hanging over Reznikov disappeared when the politician met with Western leaders and plainly stated that he had no intention of leaving office.", "How did Reznikov avoid being culled, what role did the visit of US inspectors to Kiev play in the process, and what was the big corruption scandal in the Defense Ministry of Ukraine all about?", "Various sources began speculating about the possible resignation of Reznikov on February 5. They claimed that the current Chief of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, major general Kirill Budanov, would become Reznikov's successor. The reports appeared against the background of a large corruption scandal at the ministry linked to food procurement for front-line troops.", "At the time, the chairman of President Vladimir Zelensky's Servant of the People political party, David Arakhamiya, said that Reznikov would be offered the position of Minister for Strategic Industries in order to \"strengthen military-industrial cooperation\" and would handle Western supplies of military equipment for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU).", "In the following days, the possible resignation was discussed not just in Ukrainian and Russian media, but in foreignpublications such as The Guardian and Politico. Discussions simultaneously proceeded in Kiev's Verkhovna Rada where Dmitry Razumkov, a former ally of Zelensky, promised that if the Defense Minister were to resign over a corruption scandal, parliament would not support his appointment to a new position. However, discussions in parliament quickly dissipated and Arakhamiya, who previously pushed for Reznikov's resignation, announced that no forthcoming personnel changes are expected in the government in the near future.", "On February 15, Reznikov himself clarified the situation. Asked by Reuters whether he planned to remain in office for the next few months, he replied: \"Yes, it was my president's decision.\"", "At the same time, the official suggested that criticism of him could be attributed to a desire for personal revenge by anti-corruption activist Vitaly Shabunin, over his transfer from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry back to units of the Territorial Defense Force. \"There are people, who, in the midst of a political anti-corruption career, wake up and fall asleep with my surname,\" the minister said.", "However, there are various theories as to why the resignation did not take place. According to one, an upcoming meeting with Western backers at Ramstein Air Base at that time played a role. Replacing Reznikov would have created an unfavorable impression and could have affected the negotiating process.", "Additionally, there is another unofficial version, according to which the head of the presidential administration, Andrey Yermak, defended the minister. Yermak is considered to be a patron of Reznikov, and he allegedly tried to block the replacement. Yermak has been involved in a lengthy, bitter conflict with Arakhamiya, and this has intensified amid the speculation around the defense minister.", "Despite the minister's various versions and statements, there is still talk on the sidelines of a scenario in which Reznikov will be replaced by Budanov. After all, the corruption scandal has proved to be too high-profile - not only for Ukrainian society but also for Kiev's foreign partners.", "It began when Ukrainian publication Zerkalo Nedelidisclosed the details of a 13 billion hryvnia ($353 million) contract between the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and Aktiv Company LLC for the purchase of food supplies at extremely inflated prices.", "The deal didn't involve the purchase of any special equipment, but rather basic food suppliessuch as potatoes, onions, and eggs. Secondly, the document was signed with a company whose authorized capital amounted to just 1,000 hryvnia ($27). The outrageous prices constituted the third and central reason for the scandal. The \"wholesale\" cost stated by the Ukrainian Defense Ministrywas several times higher than the retail cost of the same products in a premium-class supermarket.", "A few days later, Reznikov accused the journalists of \"manipulation\" and of \"informational attacks\" which could negatively impact Ukraine's military-aid negotiations with the West. Later, the politician admitted his \"communicative failure\" and attempted to write it off as a \"technical error,\" explaining that eggs and other products were priced per kilogram, not per unit.", "\"This is a common technical error made by the supplier. Eggs are the only category from the catalog that is calculated in pieces in the appendix to the transaction. The supplier mistakenly indicated the price not per piece, but by weight when he transferred data from one table, where everything was measured by weight, to another,\" Reznikov assured the press, claiming that taking this correction into account, the cost \"fully corresponds to the market price.\"", "Nevertheless, a cloud of suspicion descended over several ministry officials. On January 24, Deputy Minister of Defense Vyacheslav Shapovalov resigned, and, on February 3, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) detained two businessmen for selling food at inflated prices. Two other high-ranking officials also came under suspicion - Bogdan Khmelnitsky, former Deputy Head of the Department of Public Procurement and Supply of Material Resources, and Vladimir Tereshchenko, Deputy Head of the Department for the Coordination of Foreign Economic Activity. Interestingly, they were charged with offenses unrelated to the procurement of military food supplies.", "Charges against Reznikov have not yet been brought, although he hasadmitted he is responsible for the actions of his subordinates stating, \"No official remains in office forever. Not a single one. The ruling regarding my position as the Minister of Defense will be made by a single person - the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky, in accordance with the constitution. My own decisions will be based solely on the decision made by the President of Ukraine.\"", "The scandal was handled in an unusual way. Instead of dismissing the minister, Reznikov himself announced the replacement of a number of his deputies. Among them were the former Ukrainian ambassador to Canada, MP Andrey Shevchenko, and a volunteer, Vitaly Deynega.", "\"The minister has been given a chance. He has conducted a lot of activity: he proposes to appoint new deputies, to set up a public anti-corruption council. Perhaps this will give him something. But obviously this is not done on a day-to-day basis. The fact that he was given military man Aleksandr Pavlyuk as his first deputy is also a point in his favor,\" a source close to the leadership of the presidential party Servants of the People told news outlet Strana.", "The corruption scandals in Ukraine are being actively publicized by the media and are linked not only to the government's political opponents, but also to Ukraine's partners, primarily the United States. For example, Bihus.Info published an investigation into Yermak's ties with former deputies from the now banned Opposition Platform - For Life party. This was Ukraine's second largest political faction, until it was prohibited by Zelensky, as part of his crackdown on political opponents.", "Many experts have viewed the saga as an attempt by the American government to solve its own pressing issue of Republican demands that the White House establish control over US aid to Ukraine. Having gained a majority in the the House of Representatives, the Republican Party wants stricter controls over the expenditure of multibillion-dollar tranches allocated to Kiev. In Ukraine, the political consequences may also be significant.", "On January 29, several inspectors arrived in Kiev from the US. The commission included Inspectors General Diana Shaw, Robert Storch, and Nicole Angarella from the US Department of State, the Pentagon, and the Agency for International Development (USAID), respectively. According to the US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, the purpose of their visit was \"to advance independent oversight of US assistance to Ukraine\".", "The offices of all three inspectors have established an interdepartmental working group that includes similar services in other departments and several government auditing services - 17 in total. The group will be responsible for holding meetings with \"key American and Ukrainian officials, colleagues in various government agencies and non-governmental organizations implementing programs funded by the United States.\" The inspectors are clearly trying to work with the civilian population, bypassing the Ukrainian authorities.", "Among the inspectors, Robert Storch is closely familiar with Ukraine's internal affairs. From 2007 to 2009, he worked in Ukraine as a consultant on anti-corruption issues, and in 2014, he returned to Kiev to help develop anti-corruption legislation. He also advised the authorities on the creation of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU).", "Storch has already been active in Ukraine. He met with Shabunin, director of the Anti-Corruption Centre (ACC), who recently criticized the Ukrainian Presidential Office and raised issues of graft in the higher echelons of power, and who was in turn criticized by Reznikov. After the meeting with Storch, however, the anti-corruption activist wrote in his Telegram channel that \"all three inspectors-general are deeply aware both of corruption in food purchases and other problems in the Ministry of Defense (which will soon become public).\"", "Storch also made time to hold a meeting with Reznikov directly.", "It remains unclear whether the increased interest in policing corruption is an initiative by Ukraine's pro-Western structures or is part of a new strategy from Washington. Nevertheless, the US inspectors' main goal was to investigate the misuse of allocated funds. Given that the aid accounts for about half of Ukraine's budget, the US reasonably expects the funds to be used for achieving set goals and not enriching officials.", "Consequently, we can be certain that the inspectors won't disclose any serious abuses following the audit, since this would deal a blow to President Joe Biden and would also reflect negatively on American officials. However, the real information will be likely conveyed to the Ukrainian authorities in private, accompanied by urgent recommendations to dismiss the violators, even down to key members of the president's team.", "The recent wave of resignations in the Ukrainian government and in the Office of the President, which occurred before the arrival of the inspectors, was spurred only by media accusations. Except for the deputy minister for the development of communities, territories and infrastructure, Vasily Lozinsky, who was detained on suspicion of bribery, none of the dismissed officials were charged. These removals were supported by the US, but undoubtedly the words of the inspectors will carry even more weight.", "Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky will face a difficult choice. If he fires members of his team at the insistence of the United States, including key people like Yermak, this may lead to a loss of political control, since the power vertical will become aligned with the opinion of Western structures and its intermediaries, and not with the president. Conversely, if Zelensky resists, it will endanger additional financial assistance from the United States and its allies.", "The latter option, however, seems controversial. The Office of the President may decide that Ukraine's survival is currently more important for the United States than changes in government structure, which risk destabilizing the country during wartime. Therefore, it is possible that the President's Office will try to convince the US that now is a bad time for structural changes and there is no need to rock the boat any further.", "Nonetheless, even this argument will not save Zelensky from a wave of negativity and reputational damage among pro-Western media and activists. It could be a serious blow to Kiev's credibility, especially in the midst of an armed conflict, and may result in an internal political crisis. What seems more likely is that the resignations will continue, but with a gap of several months - a strategy that will demonstrate Ukraine's efforts to fight corruption to appease its Western sponsors but to also placate Ukrainian society.", "At the moment, it looks as if Reznikov has been placed under stricter supervision by activists, who are now members of the Public Council under the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, in order to retain his position. This is obviously designed to reassure US inspectors and Western agencies, demonstrating that work is being done to overcome government corruption at the highest levels. But it is possible that Reznikov's possible dismissal will be raised again in the event of a new escalation in the internal political struggle between the head of the Ukrainian presidential administration, Yermak, and his opponents, or in the event of new corruption scandals from elsewhere in government."], "headline": "  Zelensky and his cronies are trying to cover up a major corruption scandal in Ukraine - what role is the US playing?

It has taken a violent form and is likely to drag on for a long time. But the goal remains. And the decision on New START should be seen in this context, as should indications that a resumption of nuclear tests is not unthinkable. We shall leave the military side of the matter to the professionals (and we have brilliant specialists in this field), but this decision is primarily a political one. Let us try to look at it in more detail.", "The New START Treaty, recently extended for five years (in 2021), is the latest in a series of agreements that began in the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s. The final phase of the Cold War was generally a period of maximum confrontation, and the documents on missile defence and strategic arms limitation and reduction provided a framework for mutual deterrence between the nuclear superpowers. The confrontation was officially declared over at the turn of the 1990s when political, economic and ideological relations between Moscow and Washington changed.", "At the same time, the strategic element remained, and the existence of reduced, albeit very significant, nuclear capabilities remained the basis for building US-Russia relations. It was obvious against whom these arsenals were being deployed - there were no other targets.", "Since the US announced its withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, the course for dismantling the Cold War failsafe system was generally predetermined. When the New START Treaty was drafted in a brief moment of \"reset,\" many commentators noted that it was likely to be the last of its kind. Not so much because of the changing nature of contacts between Russia and the US, but because the model of bilateral agreements was ill-suited to the rapidly evolving global reality.", "In any case, the area of strategic stability was seen as the last opportunity to maintain a business relationship between Russia and the United States, as the main actors responsible for avoiding nuclear Armageddon. While everything else fell apart, at least here we understood each other.", "At some point, however, this became rather illusory. And with the outbreak of an open military confrontation in 2022, maintaining the previous approach proved to be completely impossible. In general, a unique and rather dangerous situation has arisen of an acute military confrontation between two nuclear superpowers, in which one is directly involved and the other indirectly, but no less actively.", "What does suspension (judging by the experience of recent decades, the first step towards withdrawal) mean in practice? Naturally, experts immediately recall the pointless and extremely costly arms race of the 1970s and 1980s. But there is hope that this experience will not be repeated. Moreover, there has always been a relatively influential faction in Washington that considered all treaties unfavorable and advocated maximum freedom of arms. But in today's international system, based as it is on asymmetric relationships and imbalances, the old mantra of parity looks a little outdated.", "Vladimir Putin's statement is a deliberate indication that the conflict in Ukraine and the nuclear factor are on the same level. The mention of nuclear tests is intended to indicate the possible trajectory of further moves by Russia if the NATO and US escalation continues, a desire for which was discussed many times at the recent Munich Security Conference.", "The end of the era of bilateral treaties and possibly other agreements of that period (multilateral, but initiated by the USSR and the US) is hardly a cause for rejoicing. Any \"clean-up\" of the international environment, and agreements by major countries on major issues which strengthen the foundations of political culture, are better than an unrestrained display of instinct.

These systems have, as military specialists say, the potential for non-strategic missile defense. This capability will be particularly useful for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It's an effective means of combating manned aviation, sea-based and air-based cruise missiles, tactical ballistic missiles, and operational-tactical ballistic missiles.", "Most probably, the systems will be deployed to shield the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, and to defend this decision-making center from the attacks of various types of cruise missiles. However, it will take dozens of Patriot batteries to cover all the administrative and political centers of Ukraine, including regional cities and key energy facilities. And Ukraine is unlikely to receive that many MIM-104 Patriot systems in the foreseeable future.", "Presently, the key concern is the number of anti-aircraft guided missiles that will be supplied along with the Patriot system, since the number of missiles used during the repulse of massive air attacks by the Russian Armed Forces exceeded all expectations. If Ukraine does not receive enough missiles, its two Patriot batteries will simply stand idle.", "The Patriot missile defense system also has its weak spots or rather, its particular features. For example, the Patriot AN/MPQ-53 multifunctional radar has rather low search capabilities. This feature is native not only to the Patriot system, but also to the target illumination and missile guidance radar and the multifunctional radar of the Russian S-300/400 missile defense system.", "In Russian systems, this shortcoming is compensated for by providing the S-300 and S-400 anti-aircraft missile divisions with either 5N66M-type low-altitude detectors, or 96L6E-type high-altitude detectors. Moreover, anti-aircraft missile divisions receive searchless target designation from system command posts equipped with a detection radar (RLO 64N6, S-300) or a radar complex (RLK 91N6E, S-400).", "As a result, if it's deployed near Kiev, the Patriot missile battery will have to be provided with additional search and targeting capabilities. Obtaining data from the Boeing E-3 Sentry, an option mentioned by some experts, is not particularly useful since it means that a certain number of E-3 aircraft will have to relocate to Ukrainian airfields.", "It is unlikely that the US and its allies will agree to this. But in some way, the Ukrainian military will have to solve the system's issues. And that may really be a problem.", "The capture of a Patriot air defense system is a highly unlikely scenario. The system is not a front-line weapon. It will probably be placed in the rear of the Ukrainian Army, covering Kiev or Right-bank Ukraine. It would require an offensive operation to capture the Patriot system, and even so, success is far from guaranteed. Not a single M142 HIMARS combat vehicle has yet fallen into Russian hands. Meanwhile, a detailed examination of the system is only possible following its capture and disassembly.", "The Patriot air defense systems delivered to Ukraine will become a high-priority target for the Russian Armed Forces, but the task is hardly simple. The Patriot is a highly mobile system (it takes no more than 25 minutes to deploy/fold). This means the system does not remain in the same position for long. After several missile launches, it can relocate. And finding the Patriot won't be easy.", "After February 24, the Armed Forces of Ukraine kept several divisions of the S-300PT air defense system in service. The \"PT\" abbreviation means that it's a container-type system (by the way, the weight of some containers, such as F9, exceeds 16 tons). It takes several hours to fold /deploy this modification of the S-300. Yet despite its low mobility, the container-type system is still used in the Ukrainian army. Surely, a highly mobile anti-aircraft missile system has a much higher chance of survival.", "As for the Patriot missile defense system, Russian troops may use anti-radar missiles of the X-31P type, guided air-to-surface missiles such as X-29T, X-38Mxx, X-59MK, etc., and free-fall bombs (OFAB-250-270 and FAB-500-type) to target and destroy it.

Overall, strategic planning in Washington gives little thought to the parameters for ending the crisis: Whether Ukraine will remain within its current borders, lose its territories or disappear altogether.", "Despite mounting casualties and the destruction of Ukraine's military, appetite for military action has not diminished, neither in Kiev nor in Washington. Many international experts rightly identify the US as the key player in a large coalition advocating for continued hostilities in Ukraine. In less than a year of crisis, Kiev has exhausted its own military resources and the means to replace them, and is totally dependent on external assistance.", "Though the US is taking the lead in coordinating and strategizing support from the West, it would be wrong to equate Ukrainian and American interests. While continuing to pay lip service to Kiev's political demands, Washington is carefully assessing the right moment to initiate negotiations. The need for diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict has been increasingly emphasized by US military leaders, most notably the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley. The idea continues to circulate in the British press that the American tactic is to escalate the conflict in order to later de-escalate it: to pressure Russia with a wave of large-scale deliveries of military equipment and to put Kiev in a more favorable negotiating position.", "However, it cannot be overlooked that the continuation of the military crisis in Ukraine is in line with US military and political interests. There are a total of eight arguments suggesting that the Americans intend to prolong this conflict.", "First, there is the relative weakening of Russia, which has had to devote considerable resources to eliminating the military threat from Ukraine, as well as to achieving its political objectives of securing equal status in post-Cold War European security architecture. The Western media narrative that Russia is on the verge of defeat, while far from reality, gives the impression that all the West needs to do so is adopt a wait-and-see attitude. The lack of decisive Russian military victories leads to the perception that Ukraine is winning.", "Second, the US has a vested interest in breaking up EU-Russian energy cooperation. This has developed over many decades, beginning during the Cold War. The sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, apparently conducted with the assistance of another NATO state, was the culmination of a long-term American strategy to dismantle the extensive links between Moscow and key West European economies. The Americans want to shift European energy consumption away from Russia and create a more difficult environment for broader European industry, so that American goods face less competition, thus strengthening their own position.", "Third, the US wants to eliminate any impulse for strategic autonomy among EU states. The Ukrainian crisis provides a golden opportunity for this, as the US and its allies in Eastern Europe have managed to create a moment of moral panic in the information space, preventing any reflection on the causes and consequences of the crisis. Strategic decisions on arms transfers are being taken under pressure from the media and a radicalized section of the public, without any analysis of the consequences. Leaders and elites who might have been able to reflect with detachment and sobriety on the consequences of the slide of EU-Russia relations into a deep crisis, are now outnumbered and essentially voiceless.", "Fourth, the US does not want to see the defeat of Ukraine, into which much financial, political and symbolic capital has been invested over the past year. In the eyes of the West, Ukraine is its \"champion\". The old narrative of European civilization struggling against the barbaric East, going back to the days of ancient Greece and its confrontation with the Persian hordes, is being played out here. Ukraine's defeat would be a sensitive symbolic defeat for the West and would leave an \"open wound\" in the minds of many intellectuals.", "Fifth, the US has not retreated from the ideological imperative to defend what it interprets as \"freedom\". In the situation around Ukraine, there is a Manichean presentation of the struggle for \"freedom against unfreedom\". Washington also sees this ideological imperative manifest in the domestic situation in Ukraine, which of course is only possible if you look at the political processes in Kiev \"through your fingers\". By playing along with this narrative, Vladimir Zelensky's government seeks to present itself to the West in such ideological categories.", "The sixth US objective is to encourage Western Europe to remilitarise. Washington is aware that prolonged military competition is not possible using American forces alone. Moreover, the US is conscious of the growing threat from China and realizes that its resources will soon be diverted to a confrontation in the Pacific. In the European theater, Washington is therefore looking for ways to strengthen the EU's military-industrial complex so that national defense budgets can be raised to at least 2 percent of GDP.", "Seventh, the US seeks to consolidate its European allies around a platform of fighting its \"rising\" adversaries such as Russia, China and Iran. Here, the US is trying to be resourceful in building coalitions willing to produce and sell expensive, high-tech weapons.", "Eighth, the US is also pursuing its own re-industrialisation through Ukraine. The expansion of the military-industrial complex is seen as an important goal for America. After the Cold War, it was reoriented to produce a limited number of high-tech products, whereas modern conventional warfare requires the large-scale production of relatively inexpensive generic artillery, tank and aircraft systems.", "All this makes the US extremely uninterested in working for a peaceful solution to the conflict in the short term. The Americans believe that time is on their side and that the eight objectives listed above will be achieved. This makes their strategy rather flexible and demonstrates that their priority is to contain Russia rather than secure the future security and prosperity of Ukraine."], "headline": "  Andrey Sushentsov: Here's eight reasons why the US has no interest in pushing for peace in Ukraine    ", "timestamp": "9 Feb, 2023 12:24  ", "act": "/news/571220-eight-reasons-us-war-ukraine/", "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAQAAACRI2S5AAAAEklEQVR42mP885MBL2AcVQAGAEduEafx9imZAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC"}, "/india/571852-india-new-delhi-bbc-modi/": {"paras": ["Recently, there has been outrage across India over a BBC documentary.", "Titled 'The Modi Question', theprogram shines a critical light on what it alleges was the Indian prime minister's role in anti-Muslim riots that shook the state of Gujarat in 2002.", "Indian authorities reacted by banning the documentary and denouncingit as \"colonial propaganda\".

The broadcaster's response emphasized its status as a \"trusted, independent media organization,\" and coverage of the tax probe has implied that it is politically motivated.

Especially when, in current conditions, India may decide to pursue governance decisions which are not in harmony with the values the Western nations proclaim to uphold. After all, the tilt towards India is seen with a certain romanticism in Western countries, whose officials praise it as the \"world's largest democracy\" and a partner with \"shared values.\"", "The truth, though, is that they don't truly see India as an equal. They hope, given the foundations of its political system, that India will one day be \"the same\" as they are, and anticipate a course of liberalization and political change under their guidance, similar to what was once expected from Russia and China. But, if India fails to follow that route, or continues to grow as an autonomous power which does not consent to Western dominance, the chances are that the West's tolerance for the country, and especially for Modi's government, will run out.", "This brings us to the BBC. Indian authorities are right in describing the BBC as a \"post-colonial\" institution because that's what it is. The BBC world service is not impartial at all, but an institution created with the imperialistic goal of projecting British influence overseas, paying special attention to the former dominions of the British Empire. The BBC is ideologically biased, and has unsurprisingly drawn criticism in India for its condescending coverage.", "The UK looks at India with starry-eyed nostalgia. It does not see its century-long history of colonial rule over the subcontinent as a time of exploitation, oppression, violence and inequality. Instead, it tends to believe that it has done the country a favor by boosting its development, and that this history affords it a \"special relationship\" with New Delhi. Therefore, even though Britain's Brexit ideology seeks substantial trade and financial benefits from India, the UK still believes that it has a right to interfere in its internal politics, with Modi's nationalistic and centralized rule placing them on a long-term collision course.", "Things are relatively stable now, despite this \"row\" over the documentary, but this poses the question - what happens when India becomes wealthy and powerful and does not eagerly accept the Western-centric political world order? Also, what if it seeks to be a geopolitical power in its own terms? What happens when Western countries begin to perceive India not as a partner in need of help and support, but as a rival in a similar vein to how they view China and, of course, Russia? What happens when the US-led Indo-Pacific initiative starts to appear not as something that would incorporate and help India, but something that could also potentially contain its military rise?", "This BBC documentary is a reminder to India that the collective West seeks not to befriend it, but to use it, and in turn is not likely to accept an India which does not adhere to its political terms and conditions. India's current foreign policy is often described as \"strategic autonomy,\" but in recent years the country has been overly friendly with the US to exploit mutual anti-China sentiment in a bid to gain economic opportunities for itself. At the same time, there has been a domestic political shift in India which orients it away from westernization. The West's good will for New Delhi, a superpower of the future, will one day run out, and the agenda will shift towards containment.

The war rolled over it quickly: Wehrmacht field troops quickly passed through the territorywithout stopping. The gears of the punitive machine did not immediately turn, but in the spring of 1942, Dolginovo was remembered.

He was born near Ufa in Bashkiria and was less than thirty years old. Initially, he had had no intention of becoming an officer. Kiselyov graduated from the Institute of Foreign Trade in Leningrad (the Soviet name for St. Petersburg) but had no chance to settle into his chosen caree, as the war broke out.

As soon as he recovered, Nikolay escaped - he jumped out of a moving train heading west with other prisoners. Exhausted and still recovering from his wounds, he reached a village where he was hidden. It was there that the young officer was found by the partisans. By 1942, he had already well established himself as a tactical commander in the detachment of Voronyansky, who now entrusted Kiselyov with a devilishly difficult mission.", "To begin with, he organized a field camp, where he prepared for the trip with the survivors. Besides the commander and the refugees, among whom there were 35 children, the detachment included only seven armed partisans, one of them a young woman, Anna Sirotkova. At the end of August, the caravan set off to the east.", "The target of the partisans was the 'Surazh Gate' - one of the strangest places on the Soviet-German front. This sector on the border of Russia and Belarus was a solid array of extremely dense forests and swamps, so for a long time there simply was no front line there, as such: large forces simply could not get through, and only sparse patrols controlled a line of about forty kilometers.", "From the point of view of the Russians, the main function of the 'gate' was to supply the partisans. It was a real highway for such remote places - several thousand people passed through over a few months. Instructors and partisans - equipped with walkie-talkies and explosives - proceeded to the west, while civilians, the wounded, and specialists and commanders considered important to evacuate from the German rear headed in the opposite direction.", "Kiselyov and his squad had to walk hundreds of kilometers. The Surazh Gate was not a guarantee of salvation - it just held out a chance of success.", "Literally at the very beginning of the march, the unexpected happened. The partisans came across a patrol. People scattered, but Kiselyov had already instructed everyone on what to do and where to go in such situations, so this incident had few consequences: only a couple of people were lost, and these eventually found their way back to the partisans. Within three days, Kiselyov had managed to regather his charges.", "They walked along forest paths, almost always at night. The roads were deadly - crossing them was a whole operation every time. If they had run into a patrol, eight armed partisans would not have been able to shoot their way out. And with 35 children and many women, it was unrealistic to run away, so they had to proceed with the greatest caution. It was often necessary to make huge loops through the forests in order to bypass a particularly unpleasant swamp or a German garrison blocking the path.", "Local partisans sometimes provided food and guides. The route was not always clear and it was necessary to just walk in an approximate direction. Provisions had to be requisitioned in the villages. When the exhausted refugees lay down to sleep, Kiselyov and his comrades continued to work - they searched for food, scouted, stood guard, and negotiated with local residents. Everyone was chronically malnourished; many were sick.", "One young man named Shimon had bloody diarrhea on the way and could barely walk. Someone demanded that he be left behind, but his mother said she wouldn't allow her son to be killed: the partisan commander calmed everyone down and ordered that the young man be carried by the arms.", "A three-year-old girl named Bella constantly cried from hunger. The child couldn't be consoled, but her sobs could have been the ruin of everyone - because of the marshes blocking the roads, they often had to make their way right under the noses of German garrisons and patrols. Some of the refugees proposed leaving her or even drowning her. Kiselyov carried the toddler in his arms for many kilometers, calming and feeding her from his own ration. He understood that people were simply mad with hunger, fatigue, and fear.", "This man proved himself to be pure iron. He didn't allow his group to fall apart: the stragglers were waited for, while the lost ones were persistently searched for. And his group began to grow as new people joined Kiselyov's rag-tag band. Meanwhile, some dropped out from exhaustion, while cold, hunger, and deprivation exacerbated all diseases. It often happened that a refugee just didn't wake up in the morning.", "They had to hurry. It was already late autumn, and it was only at the end of November that Kiselyov's caravan approached the Surazh Gate. Snowfall had already begun. The party could simply die in the cold, either from hypothermia or by attracting the attention of patrols with bonfires. However, the partisans and refugees still had time.But there was almost a catastrophe.", "At the end of the autumn of 1942, the Germans decided to finally solve the problem of the Surazh Gate and strengthen its perimeter. To begin with, they simply reinforced the patrols, sending jagdkommandos to the gate. Kiselyov's detachment stumbled upon one of them just a hair's breadth from territory controlled by the Red Army.", "A chaotic shootout ensued in the autumn forest. The partisans fought while the refugees rushed to freedom - there was only a scant distance left to go. The partisans covered the refugees retreat and followed them. In the end, the German detachment fell behind - the soldiers were afraid to wander too deep into Soviet territory. There were no more Nazis ahead.", "At the end, when already at a railway station, the refugees were hit by an air raid - fortunately with no consequences.", "Kiselyov, exhausted to the extreme, relinquished his charges, reported to command... and was immediately arrested! Counterintelligence decided that he was just a deserter. The partisan commander was only rescued by refugees that came running back and vividly explained who he was and what he had done.", "Already among his own, Kiselyov compiled a brief report for the partisan movement's central headquarters. Fifty-two refugees had died of exhaustion or been lost along the way, while 218 were brought out alive.", "The march undermined Nikolay Kiselyov's health, and he was medically discharged. However, the partisan gradually recovered and returned to normal life after the war. He married Anna, the partisan girl with whom he had shared the hardships of the campaign.

Peace would obviously limit them, as deliveries would dry up, but those resources in situ would still be at the disposal of the Ukrainian government.", "Yet, Zelensky's government acts as if it sees no value in preserving Ukrainian statehood. The administration is squandering citizens' lives and the economic fabric of the country in the belief that this sacrifice is necessary to gain some possible, rather indefinite, advantage in the future.

Meanwhile, Kiev is still actively betting that Russia's $300 billion in foreign currency reserves, frozen in the West, will fall into its hands. What would amount to state-piracy would also allow it use the money as it sees fit.", "As a result, Zelensky expects that even if he is defeated and loses part of his territory, he will remain in power as the military leader the West needs for the new Ukraine, which will be the main anti-Russian outpost on NATO's eastern borders. One that will be armed to the teeth, saturated with Western economic aid and that will provide its citizens with an acceptable standard of living.", "I believe that Zelensky is genuinely convinced he will succeed in turning Ukraine into something like Israel, a paramilitary state in a hostile environment, and living with a sense of constant military threat. I do not exclude the possibility that even in the worst-case scenario, where there is a complete collapse of his government, Zelensky expects to find himself and a group of his closest associates in exile in the West.

Such questions lead to theoretical arguments, but do little to distinguish superpowers from other actors in the international arena, and here lies one of the most important factors.", "We could suggest that the notable difference between a superpower and lesser peers is the existence of a systematic and coherent political philosophy of international relations. A superpower offers its own unique perspective on how the world should be structured, by what rules it should exist, what its purpose is, and why this particular country is legitimate in its role.", "Of course, political philosophy is not just a collection of slogans and clich\u00e9s. It is not only a pretty package or a simulation, an ideology or, indeed, a utopia. All this may be a derivative of the theme, but it should not exhaust its content. It is a specific interpretation of key political concepts in international relations - power, authority, justice, equality and the like. Such an understanding should be based on a deep intellectual tradition and one's own practical experience, which make the arguments of the proposed doctrine convincing both for oneself and for others.", "Can a country represent a value based on material factors alone? Undoubtedly. A state can concentrate considerable power and live solely on the principles of realism, pursue pragmatic policies, promote its economic interests and achieve domination wherever possible. However, naked realism will sooner or later reach the limits of its legitimacy. The rule of the bayonet and the purse will be shaky without a clear understanding of why, and for what reason, it exists.", "Can a country have an influential political philosophy while being materially backward? Certainly. At a certain point it can be a model of stoicism or heroism, a bearer of innovative and attractive ideas. But without a solid fiscal base, these run the risk of hanging in the air and remaining as wishful thinking.", "It is noteworthy that there are surprisingly few countries with both material power and a political philosophy of their own. It seems that creating such a doctrine is much easier than building a missile or a nuclear bomb. Put \"clever people\" in charge, process the results of their \"brainstorming\", write some basic works and turn them into manuals for propagandists, and that is all! In reality, many such efforts crumble and get lost in the noise of information. A few copies remain in the hands of a few people.", "Must the political philosophy of a superpower be \"sovereign\"? Should it be based solely on a national intellectual tradition? The answer tends to be \"no\". Exceptionally original political-philosophical doctrines with a global impact are extremely difficult to find. They are usually a mixture of universal ethical principles, categories of major political-philosophical doctrines such as liberalism, socialism or conservatism, nationally specific views and principles, and even religious doctrines such as Christianity or Islam.", "There are only two countries in the world today that combine both significant material potential and their own political philosophy. They are the United States and the People's Republic of China.", "The political-philosophical core of the US is well known and widely reproduced at all levels - from university monographs and textbooks to propaganda videos and social media posts. It is based on liberal principles, with their supremacy of human reason, the idea of \"freedom from adversity\", justice as fairness, equality of opportunity within uniform rules, and derived ideas of democracy as the optimal form of government and the market as the organization of the economy. This political-philosophical code is a product of the European Enlightenment and the specific experience of organizing the internal life of European countries, which was embodied on the basis of the American political experience and multiplied by the material power of the United States. The European roots of US political philosophy make it easy for it to take root in many Western countries, even if in some places it contradicts individual interpretations \"on the ground\". Importantly, there is also a strong modernist potential in such a political philosophy, because, in general, it's one of emancipation, liberation and rational progress.", "China's political-philosophical pivot is far less known, simply because Beijing has not yet sought to actively promote it abroad. Its messaging has long remained largely nationally focused. But it is systemic, deeply reflective and has great potential beyond China's borders. It is based on the view of international relations as a non-zero-sum game, the idea of collectivity, and a departure from rivalry as the leitmotif of world politics. The strong element of Marxism in contemporary Chinese political philosophy gives it a modernist potential combined with the experience of dealing with the country's own key problems. It combines the ideas of people's democracy with the successful experience of fighting poverty, overcoming underdevelopment and reducing social inequalities. In today's world, China appears as a country whose ideas have been tested by practice. Yes, many of its successes have been made possible by its integration into the Western-centered global economy. But here, too, China tends to follow its own philosophical line - using cooperation, borrowing Western experience and combining it with its own traditions. In effect, Marxism is a Western doctrine put at China's service.", "Will there be a clash of political philosophies between the US and China? Most likely yes, because Beijing is perceived in the US as a long-term threat. China avoids copying and \"mirroring\" American accusations against it by promoting the idea of playing the non-zero-sum game, thereby making its political philosophy an even more visible alternative. One could argue for a long time whether it is material factors or ideas that are primary in the contradictions between the powers. Obviously, if necessary, differences in ideas can be used for political mobilization and the consolidation of allies. The more systemic such ideas are, the easier it is to draw dividing lines.", "Are the political philosophies of the US and the PRC self-sufficient? No. Both the US and China combine their political philosophies with the principles of realism. Like many other actors, they assume the risk of worst-case scenarios and prepare for them by accumulating resources for mutual deterrence. However, political philosophy allows them to maintain or claim global legitimacy for their influence.", "Does Russia have a political philosophy of its own? The answer so far is it does not. Russia has returned to the principles of realism in its foreign policy, which was an achievement on its own. But it is too early to speak of a systematic and well-developed political philosophy. There are still a number of vague, sometimes contradictory ideas, concepts, interpretations and slogans derived from them. There is a clear lack of modernist potential in the Russian system of views. Its necessity may be debatable in itself, but it is clearly embedded in the US, China and in many lesser powers.", "Russia has recently experienced the collapse and loss of its political-philosophical project, which began to rot long before the disintegration of the USSR. Perhaps it is the Soviet experience that still causes a persistent and unconscious allergy to political philosophy. It is also possible that both the US and China will at some point face the same problem that the Soviet Union had - a disconnect between its doctrine and the real state of affairs. Perhaps freedom from political philosophy is now Russia's advantage. Maybe Russia will develop its own unique experience, which will allow it to avoid mechanically copying others' ideas and mixing them with its own practice.

The previous day, Israeli officials had reportedly been briefed on the deal, which was the cause of much optimism, with an unnamed source telling Axios news that Lapid \"made it clear that Israel will not compromise on its security and economic interests, even if that means that there will be no agreement soon.\"", "Later on Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz ordered the military establishment to prepare for an armed confrontation with Lebanon. A four-hour cabinet meeting, which was said to have been attended by major Israeli security establishment figures, was then concluded with a public announcement that the prime minister and defense minister had been granted permission to strike Lebanon without further cabinet approval.", "In early June, a ship owned by the gas company Energean arrived at the resource-rich Karish field in the Eastern Mediterranean to begin preparations for natural gas production for Israel. Lebanese President Michel Aoun condemned the arrival, warning Tel Aviv against taking any further \"aggressive action.\" The Karish field, as well as the nearby Qana field, have for years been central to on-off US-mediated negotiations between Lebanon and Israel. The two nations have still not come to any agreement on the demarcation of their maritime borders, with Beirut seeing Karish and Qana as vital to reviving its collapsing economy.", "While Lebanon maintains, due to legal arguments put forth in previous negotiations, that the entire area is to be considered 'disputed waters,' Israel has maintained that all of the Karish field and the majority of the Qana field are within its own 'Exclusive Economic Zone'. The Lebanese political and military party Hezbollah, which claims to have 100,000 battle-ready troops at its disposal, then weighed in on the debate, vowing to protect Lebanon's rights to its oil and gas.", "Secretary General of Lebanese Hezbollah Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah declared that if no maritime border deal were reached and Lebanon is not able to secure its rights, then military action will be taken. Nasrallah vowed that the new reality would be \"If we can't have our resources, nobody can.\" Hezbollah's red line is Israeli extraction from the Karish field before any agreement is signed - if this happens, the group has threatened to strike not only Tel Aviv's infrastructure at site, but every other Israeli oil and gas facility in the Mediterranean.", "Israel has since responded with threats of its own, which have ranged from a vow to eliminate the entire densely populated Beirut suburb that serves as Hezbollah's stronghold, to Benny Gantz's recent warning that the whole of Lebanon would \"pay a heavy price\" for any military action by Hezbollah. Now that the negotiations have reached a \"make or break\" point, there are significant fears that military action will be taken, either by Israel or Hezbollah.", "The most recent threats issued by the military and political leadership in Tel Aviv have caused panic among Israelis living near the Lebanese border. However, there is a significant possibility that the rhetoric is aimed at a domestic audience. Israel will enter into a new round of national elections in November and the demarcation of maritime borders has recently been weaponized against the current Israeli leadership, causing ministers to act in order to save face.", "Israeli opposition leader and former long-time prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu began to lash out at interim-PM Yair Lapid back in September, releasing a video in which he claimed that Lapid had \"totally folded in the face of Nasrallah's threats\" and that Hezbollah had forced him to delay extraction from the Karish field. Netanyahu has continued to heavily criticize his political opponents' handling of the demarcation-line issue, with similar claims that Israel is backing down over the threats issued by Lebanese Hezbollah.", "Netanyahu's words ring true in that Lapid has clearly been forced to take the issue of demarcation of maritime borders very seriously and has conceded on positions held by Tel Aviv in the past. In addition to this, the extraction of gas from the Karish field has also been delayed, as Energean, which owns the rights to extract from the site, was initially prepared to begin operations in late September and has so far refrained from doing so. However, had Netanyahu remained as PM, he would hardly have had any other choice but to do the same.", "The threats made by Hezbollah are very serious, and the group apparently has the capacity to follow through with them and destroy all of Israel's oil and gas facilities. At this time, however, the Israeli far-right camp headed by Netanyahu is blaming the situation on Lapid's weak governance, saying he is prepared to give away territory that belongs to Israel. For this reason, it is likely that Yair Lapid will attempt to delay extraction of gas from the Karish field in order to sideline the issue until after the elections.", "Lebanon sees the Karish and Qana issue as integral to its survival. Some UN experts put the percentage of Lebanese living in poverty at around 80%, while the country endures round-the-clock blackouts, a rising crime rate, and civil instability. Some people have even been spotted searching for food in garbage bins, as well as fighting over loaves of bread at bakeries. Getting its hands on a possible multi-billion-dollar oil and gas field is a matter of life or death for Beirut - but not for Tel Aviv, which enjoys far more economic stability.", "The US mediator in the Lebanon-Israel talks, Amos Hochstein, gave an interview to the American owned al-Hurra TV in June, laughing when asked about the prospect of trading the Karish field for Qana. Months later, after Hezbollah upped its threats and the group's leader, Nasrallah, stated that the Lebanese people would not be laughed at, this issue has become a rather grave one. The US, which has a clear pro-Israeli bias, is now being forced to take the talks much more seriously.", "Earlier this year, as the European Union looked for alternative gas suppliers, a deal was inked between Tel Aviv and Brussels, under which Israel would send gas through pipelines to Europe via Egypt. This has encouraged Tel Aviv to announce its plans to double its gas output, and the Karish field is key to achieving this.", "The Qana field, however, has not yet been explored and will take time to develop. Despite this, one of the key reasons for Israel's rejection of the Lebanese proposal is that Beirut refuses to pay Tel Aviv royalties for the gas it would extract from the Qana field should it be handed to Lebanon. Beirut cannot commit itself to such an agreement, because this would mean normalizing ties with the Tel Aviv regime, which still occupies Shebaa farms - an area that Lebanon claims as its rightful territory.", "Whether war happens will now boil down to whether bickering between Israeli political parties and individual officials will cause Tel Aviv to adopt a belligerent approach and push forward with gas production in the disputed fields before an agreement is reached. If it does, there can be little doubt that Hezbollah will open fire if its red line is crossed. Israel's stake in the matter is additional energy revenues, while for Lebanon it is potentially a matter of life or death.

When Eduard was about three years old, the family moved to Kharkov - where, less than a year ago, the Armed Forces of Russia and Ukraine were engaged in fierce battle on its outskirts. Limonov grew up in the East Ukrainian city.There, he took his first steps in life and wrote his first poems.

The Big Apple symbolized their entire hope for the future. However, these dreams were not meant to come true.", "The couple lived on the verge of poverty - Limonov's work didn't fare better in the US than in the USSR. Meanwhile, his irritation and frustration grew. Unlike most Soviet emigrants, who fell in love with Western capitalism, Limonov wrote impassioned opinion piecesin America's Russian-language publications and lashed out at consumer society. As a result of his fervent criticism of capitalism and nostalgia for the Soviet past, Limonov was 'canceled' in the emigrant press and deprived of his last source of income.", "Limonov's wife left him. The poet sank all the way down to the bottom of the social ladder. But these trials only made him stronger and provided the author with material for the best-selling books that would turn him into a legendduring his lifetime.", "Abandoned by the person closest to him, his wife, Limonov became an ordinary immigrant in New York's melting pot. As a writer, he masterfully used his intuition to take this theme beyond the confines of personal drama and turned it into a clash of political and class issues. His autobiographical hero's beloved is seduced by the rich and prosperous American bourgeoisie that easily tricks naive Russians with its promises of freedom and prosperity.", "Limonov's desperate hero plunges into the world of drugs and sexual promiscuity, including same-sex relationships. However, Limonov doesn't portray this in the light of Beatnik-like views - as a liberating lifestyle, but rather in the spirit of Dostoevsky - as a fall into the circles of hell. As a result, his first novel, 'It's Me, Eddie,' became a modern Russian classic, a heartbreaking, pornographic, and yet conservative text about love.", "NoUS publisher would touchthe scandalous novel. Limonov was able to publish it only in France, where he moved in 1980. It became an overnight success - Limonov achieved worldwide fame, was highly rated by readers and critics alike, and his book was translated into dozens of languages. Spurred on by the success, Limonov continued relating his New York misadventures in new works. In the novel 'His Butler's Story', Limonov recounted his experience of serving in the house of a very rich American (specifically, billionaire Peter Sprague); and in the novel 'The Diary of a Loser, or a Secret Notebook' Limonov talks about struggling with a system that is totally alien to him and his desire for a global revolution.", "Over the years, Limonov would come to write dozens of books - novels, collections of poems and short stories, philosophical treatises, and essays.", "Among the countless works, his Kharkov trilogy stands out in particular. As befits a Russian classic, Limonov offered his take on the classic Russian literature theme of childhood, adolescence, and youth. Another trilogy is known as the 'prison trilogy' and it was written during Limonov's imprisonment in Russia in the 2000s. Taking this dark page of life as a creative challenge, he applied his talent to describe prison life and the people that are part of it. The trilogy - 'Imprisoned by Dead Men', 'From Prison to Prison', and 'The Triumph of Metaphysics' - is rightfully considered one of the most powerful statements about the Russian people and the Russia that most artists prefer not to notice.", "During his entire life, Limonov hardly had a day off from writing. In his last book, 'The Old Man Travels', he describes the chaos of an aged man's memories, represented as flashes of various episodes of his life. The book was submitted for publication just five days before his death.", "Having moved to Paris and published his first book, Limonov returned to his usual bohemian ways.Everything was going well for Limonov. Now a famous Parisian writer, he published one book after another. He was married to his new love - the singer and actress Natalia Medvedeva. By the end of the 1980s, Limonov had acquired French citizenship. But the life of a superstar author was too boring for someone who was a revolutionary at heart.", "With the beginning of perestroika, Limonov underwent a major transformation, much to the horror of his Parisian friends. He criticized USSR leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who was so heartily welcomed by the West, and gave numerous interviews to the French media, saying that the reformers are a disgrace to the Soviet Union and that his father, an NKVD officer, would've never approved of this.", "\"In Paris, he was kicked out from all social circles and events. But by that time, he couldn't care less\" ", "said Limonov's translator Thierry Marignac about this period of his life.", "Out of this rage, a new Limonov emerged - Limonov the politician. As the Soviet Union collapsed and people fled from the country, Limonov permanently returned to Russia and got his citizenship back (which had been revoked by the Soviet authorities). However, in those years he didn't stay in Russia all the time. In the biographical novel 'Limonov', which sold millions of copies across the world, French author Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re wrote that Limonov couldn't live without waging his own war. In the '90s, just as he was about to turn 50, Limonov finally got his wish.", "First as a war correspondent and then as a volunteer, Limonov traveled to various hot spots in the former USSR and Yugoslavia. In Bosnia, he sided with the Serbs, met the president of the unrecognized Serbian republic Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 and was even captured on film holding an automatic weapon and shooting in the direction of besieged Sarajevo.", "\"The official reason for my escapades in those years was journalism,\" Limonov said, \"My diagnosis was simple: I was an adventurer working under the cover of a war correspondent.\"", "After Yugoslavia, he went to Abkhazia and Transnistria to fight on the side of the ethnic minorities that rose up against the central government of the newly formed states. According to war correspondent Vladislav Shurygin, who covered the conflicts, Limonov was a \"good soldier.\" \"Of course, in his books, he always imagined himself as a commander, and perhaps he could've been one. But in Transnistria, he was a soldier. He marched ahead when ordered to go and stopped when he was ordered to stop. He ate what was available and slept where it was possible to sleep.\" ", "In the new millennium, Limonov finally attempted to begin his own war. In 2000, along with his supporters, he traveled to Kazakhstan to back the Russian uprising in Semipalatinsk. When it failed, he started planning another one. He was eventually arrested in the Altai region along with seven other people and charged with illegal weapons possession, terrorism, and the preparation of a coup d'\u00e9tat. Limonov's lawyers managed to clear him of most charges, and he served a sentence only for illegal weapons possession.", "Back in his emigrant days, Limonov was familiar with left-wing radical circles. In the US, he got to know American Trotskyists from the Social Workers Party and participated in their rallies. In France, he was friends with the leaders of the French Communist Party and regularly wrote for their newspaper.", "But in Russia, Limonov couldn't just be a regular leftist. In 1993, he created a political Frankenstein - the National Bolshevik Party (NBP), the name of which partially referred to one of the 20th century's most horrific regimes. The party flag displayed a black hammer and sickle placed in a white circle against a red background - a direct reference to the flag of the Third Reich, with the hammer and sickle replacing the swastika. The party newspaper was called Limonka - not just a reference to Limonov's last name, but also to the nickname of the Soviet F-1 hand grenade, which was to become another symbol of Limonov the politician.", "According to its own followers, the NBP was a radically anti-centrist party, \"totally 'right' and eternally 'left' at the same time.\" Limonov himself didn't consider this a contradiction - in his opinion, the future of Russia lay in the joint hands of nationalists and communists.", "NBP party members soon became known for their radical opposition to the authorities: during their relatively peaceful rallies, they threw mayonnaise, tomatoes, and eggs at political leaders and temporarily seized government buildings. The party, which Limonov had unsuccessfully tried to register since 1998, became known for its open support of war, terrorism, and revolution. In 2007, it was named extremist and banned by law.", "When the NBP was prohibited, Limonov quickly created another party, The Other Russia, which was also never officially registered.", "In 2014, the authorities suddenly found Limonov on their side. In contrast to many other opposition members, the National Bolsheviks supported the return of Crimea to the Russian Federation. However, this turn of events surprised only those who weren't familiar with the writer's ideology. Back in 1999, on Ukraine's Independence Day, NBP party members seized the tower of the Sailors' Club in Sevastopol, which was then part of Ukraine. At about 10 a.m., the party members decorated the tower's striking clock, which performed the tune 'Glory to Sevastopol' with a banner that read \"Sevastopol is a Russian city!\" Then, they put up the NBP flag. Unsurprisingly, Limonov was made persona non grata in Ukraine and couldn't even bid goodbye to his parents, who remained in Kharkov.", "After the \"Russian spring\" series of protests in Donbass, Limonov's party took an active part in the conflict and hundreds of itsmembers went to the front as volunteers.", "However, the writer himself eventually became disappointed with the Donbass uprising, accusing its leaders of narrow thinking.", "\"Why did you choose this path? You are too dependent on Russia, you could've had a lot more freedom. Why didn't you help Kharkov?! You abandoned Kharkov!\"", "All things considered, Limonov wasn't successful as a politician - his multiple attempts to participate in elections consistently failed.

Their hour-long meeting took place on the sidelines of an Afghanistan conference, organized under the aegis of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Doval is only the second Indian NSA to have had an individual meeting with the Russian president. The first such meeting was the inaugural NSA Brajesh Mishra, back in 2001. Of all Indian high-ranking officials, only Prime Ministers have ever had direct meetings with Putin. Even the country's External Affairs Ministers have been excluded, including the incumbent Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.", "Doval retired as the IB chief in 2005, having only served in that capacity for 18 months, prior to the introduction of a compulsory two-year tenure for the post. He then founded a nationalistic think-tank, Vivekananda International Foundation (VIF). In 2014, he became NSA after Prime Minister Narendra Modi was elected.", "Soon after, Doval hit the headlines. In June that year, he negotiated the release of 46 Indian nurses who were trapped in a hospital in Tikrit, Iraq, which was reeling under an Islamic State (IS) onslaught.

For almost three decades, India has passively accepted such provocations.

The group was tasked with assisting the National Security Council and helping with a long-term strategic defense review. The move made Doval the most powerful bureaucrat in India since 1998 when the NSA post was created.", "The group has become the main mechanism for inter-ministerial coordination in forming national security policies and his uninterrupted access to the PM makes him much more powerful than many of the ministers in the Modi cabinet.", "In 2019, Doval was reappointed as NSA for five more years and given a Cabinet rank in the second term of the Modi-led National Democratic Alliance government.", "In their book, 'Spy Stories: Inside the Secret World of the RAW and the ISI', British journalists, Adrian Levy and Cathy Scott-Clark, describe how India's security infrastructure became more flexible and sensitive under Doval's watch. \"The perception game and narrative control became far more sophisticated, selling the story of India to foreign partners,\" they said.", "\"Under Doval, foreign powers traditionally suspicious of India were wooed... When to fight, and how to fight, and who would read about it were all indices in Doval's calculations,\" they added.", "It is estimated that the Doval Doctrine has been a success in containing internal security challenges in J&K. The average lifespan of a hardened separatist after appearing on the defense forces' radar has been reduced to only 4-12 weeks from an earlier estimate of six months to two years.", "Several columnists, defense analysts and Doval's former colleagues have branded him a hawk. He has also been criticized for deliberately pushing hard-line nationalism in tune with the policy of India's ruling right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party and the influence of which is being felt in its foreign policy. His statements on Pakistan and China, in particular, have been cited as India's \"muscular Hindutva narrative\".", "Doval has also been called out for his vaulting ambition.

He would stay on the right side. But I won't say that he doesn't have his preferences. That's why I said he has never possibly been happier in his career than he is today because he and Modi are just made for each other.\"", "He has often drawn flak from his detractors for his purported disregard for conflict management and alleged human rights violations. He has been accused of being quick on the draw in ordering the elimination of separatists posing internal security challenges in parts of India, including J&K, which has been a victim of cross-border terrorism by non-state actors from neighboring Pakistan.", "However, he has also found praise from unexpected quarters and high places.", "Doval's prominent role in foreign policy was emphasized by former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. In his book, 'Never Give an Inch: Fighting for the America I Love', he recalls Doval's general acceptance from Washington to Moscow.", "Pompeo, who was the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director in the Trump administration from 2017 to 2018 and then served as the Secretary of State from 2018 to 2021, wrote: \"On the Indian side, my original counterpart was not an important player on the Indian foreign policy team.

It is believed that Doval and Putin's talks went beyond the strategic ties between Russia and India, as the NSA purportedly briefed the Russian leader about the mood in Washington and London, according to an official in the Ministry of External Affairs.", "India, while having no direct stake in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, has to tread the middle ground between its partnerships with Russia and the US, at the same time seeking a more prominent global role for itself as the leading voice of the Global South. The rare one-on-one chat between the Russian president and one of New Delhi's most influential figures, coupled with the latter's preceding tour of the \"other camp\" in Washington, could be indicative of India's attempts to carve out recognition and influence that would come by playing a role in ending year-long conflict that has been rocking global politics.", "Russia, on the other hand, wants to maintain and further develop its partnerships after the sanctions and restrictions effectively cut it off from much of the Western markets. The Putin-Doval meeting, besides whatever its more practical implications may be, can be seen as a sign of special trust. As a former KGB officer, Putin may feel a greater degree of kinship with Doval, an added bonus to the sheer practicality of having a direct line with Modi's most trusted aide.

Xi's initiatives are indisputable - they talk about joint prosperity, the support of production chains, etc. However, in the modern world, which has apparently lost all mutual trust, it remains unclear how all of this can be implemented. Especially in the context of the current confrontation with the West, which sides against Beijing. Are America and its satellites ready to form such a community, based on the Chinese model? No. Even some third world countries are not ready for it,\" the expert said.", "Lomanov added that the West has ignored Russia's concerns about NATO expansion over the past 25 years, and neither will it listen to Beijing's appeal.", "\"China is a powerful country. But it can hardly become a broker that all sides of the conflict will trust. For example, the cessation of fire is hardly possible as long as the idea of a military victory over Russia dominates in the West,\" he explained.", "The experts added that historically, China has never been a mediator and it is not interested in becoming one in the context of the Ukrainian conflict. According to Kashin, the US suggested that China take on such a role at the start of Russia's military offensive, but there entreaties wererefused.", "At the same time as Beijing delivered peace initiative, there was increasing talk concerning possible weapons supplies from China to Russia. Sullivan declared that the US sent Beijing a clear warning regarding any such steps. CIA Director William Burns claimed to CBS News that US intelligence has evidence that China is seriously considering the possibility of supplying weapons to Russia, but has not made a final decision yet. Both Beijing and Moscow deny the existence of such plans.", "Previously, Secretary of State Antony Blinken had asserted that Chinese companies were already helping Russia fight Ukraine by providing non-lethal military assistance and assisting Moscowin avoiding Western economic sanctions. Some Chinese organizations have already fallen under US sanctions, as a result. For example, on January 26, the US Treasury imposed restrictions against the Tianyi Research Institution (Changsha) and its subsidiary in Luxembourg for supposedly providing the Russian company Terra Tech with images of Ukraine from satellites equipped with synthetic-aperture radars (SAR). Terra Tech, in turn, allegedly transmitted the images to PMC Wagner.", "Consequently, China reacted sharply to the West's attempt to interfere in its policy towards Moscow. While in Russia, Wang Yi said that Chinese-Russian relations are rock solid and will withstand any test proposed by the evolving international situation.", "The head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, claimed that during an informal conversation in Munich, Wang Yi asked him why Beijing should not supply weapons to Russia if the EU supplies weapons to Ukraine. \"I had to explain the big difference, telling him what a big threat the war in Ukraine poses to us,\" Borrell said.", "According to Lomanov, this is China's way of showing its weariness with the West's double standards, and its dwindling hope in cooperating with the European Union on equal footing.", "\"For a long time, China has believed in the strategic autonomy of Europe. But Europe is increasingly becoming an appendage of the American policy in containing China.", "That's how it was with the sanctions: The EU imposed restrictions because of the situation in Xinjiang, but was very surprised to face countermeasures. And now Beijing is demonstrating that theoretically, it is able to take symmetrical action regarding the situation in Ukraine. However, I think that in the matter of weapons supplies to Russia, China won't go past rhetoric statements,\" Lomanov concluded."], "headline": "  Chinese peace plan: Can Beijing find a way to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, despite open hostility from the US and NATO?

After the Bolshevik revolution and the civil war, the Soviet power struggle went on for years and contributed to the subsequent instability of the country. Following the Ukrainian-born Leon Trotsky's political defeat in 1927, Stalin consolidated his power. Trotsky had wanted a world revolution; whereas, Stalin intended to build socialism in one country. He introduced the collectivization of the agricultural sector, which involved the repression of kulaks (private farmers) and led to famine and the deaths of millions.", "The wave of political repression from 1936-1938, also known as the Great Terror, is one of the most significant elements ofStalin's legacy. In the West, this period is usually seen through the prism of British historian Robert Conquest, who has been accused by others - such as American historian J. Arch Getty - of constant extrapolation of casualty figures and of omitting the beginning of the purges under Lenin. These figures are constantly reviewed by historians, but the West has focused more on this period than on anything else. Nonetheless, the fact remains that Stalin's policies were extremely harsh.", "He has also been held responsible for causing forced famines in Ukraine, southern Russia and Kazakhstan, which killed millions of people. ", "The way in which Stalin conducted the war against Nazi Germany would also be a source of criticism, after the war's conclusion. The leader had ruthlessly sent millions of soldiers to their deaths following his \"not a step back!\" proclamation in order to break Hitler's war machine.", "His approach inflicted the greatest amount of damage on the Axis armies but at a tremendous cost. Such a sacrifice of life was anathema to Western leaders seeking reelection even during wartime. According to many historians, including Gil Meron, this was a major factor in the Allies continual postponement of opening a second front in Europe and one that enraged Stalin, as evidenced by his correspondence with Churchill. Essentially, the sacrifice made by the Soviets was both welcome and appalling from the Western point-of-view.", "Currently, Stalin is known in the West mostly for his brutality, and few academics and writers have taken the time to explore the man, the era, and the circumstances during his time in power. However, historians such as J. Arch Getty and Matthew E. Lenoe are more pragmatic in evaluating the leader's role in the events of the 1930s and 1940s. Likewise, Karl Schl\u00f6gel's book 'Moscow 1937' provides a more complete picture of Stalin's leadership of the Soviet Union. These researchers thoroughly describe the events of the purges and political oppression, but also note the unprecedented modernization and technological progress that occurred in tandem during the period.", "When Stalin won his political battle against Trotsky, the country was already completely shattered following the Bolsheviks' merciless seizure of power, the subsequent civil war and Red Terror. The country had never been an industrial power and understanding that an important war was coming, Stalin famously explained the situation in a speech to industrial managers in 1931: \"We are fifty or a hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must make good this distance in ten years. Either we do it, or we shall be crushed.\"", "As a general rule, historians work without a moral bias and a political figure is usually analyzed according to the state of the country when he came to power versus when he left. The industrialization of the Soviet Union led to disastrous casualties among the population, however it did modernize the country. As Isaac Deutscher said, (though the quote is frequently attributed to Winston Churchill) \"The core of Stalin's genuine historic achievement lies in the fact that he found Russia working with the wooden plough and left her equipped with atomic piles.\"", "What Western historians and journalists write today about Stalin is one thing, but one should not forget how the Soviet leader was seen at the time. For many in the West, the Russian Revolution and the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" were a shining light in the East, a promise of better days, a real source of hope. And for a long time, Stalin was the incarnation of this light. Hence the nickname \"Father of nations\", that Soviet propaganda and communists all over the world gave him. The weight of communist parties in countries such as France or Italy, controlled by the Communist International (Komintern) was a trump card in the hand of the USSR to propagate a favorable image of its leader among Western populations. The fascination was such that European communists were reluctant to engage in resistance against Hitler until Stalin gave a green light, following the beginning of Germany's invasion of the USSR. But the masses were not the only ones to be fascinated by Stalin and what he incarnated.", "The work of the genius German publisher and communist activist Willy M\u00fcnzenberg had a supreme influence on intellectuals and poets all over Europe. Playing on the primordial fascination with this new economic model being built in the USSR, he monitored and/or created many \"useful idiots\" (or \"fellow travelers\"). Some, like Andr\u00e9 Gide or Arthur Koestler, went on to be quickly disillusioned, but mom didn't. With the appearance of popular fronts in Europe and the turmoil of the Spanish civil war, many left-wing intellectuals maintained their position for a long time while enjoying an excellent reputation in elite circles. Louis Aragon, Jean-Paul Sartre, Louis Althusser, New York Times correspondent Walter Duranty, Pablo Neruda, Ernest Hemingway, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, Romain Rolland... quite a lot of respected voices. Because of their left-wing sensibility, anticolonial stance, pacifism or idealism, they fostered a positive image of Moscow, and, consequently, of Stalin. Arthur Koestler's novel \"Darkness at noon\", which depicts the politico-psychological process of the 1930's purges, was not heeded by many of these intellectuals. Sarte, for example, later moved from Stalinism to Maoism.", "Furthermore, people, such as the \"Cambridge five\" or physicist Klaus Fuchs, actively spied for the USSR. And it was to fight for a cause, not for money. Their contribution to the reinforcement of Moscow's power and the creation of the first Soviet atomic weapons can not be underestimated. On yet another level, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill had been sincerely impressed by the Soviet leader, with whom the American president had a courteous correspondence. An Ifop poll conducted at the end of World War II showed the majority of the French population believed that the Soviet Union had won the war, not Western powers. Stalin's popularity was at its peak and he was arguably the most powerful man in the world.", "In 1956, Nikita Khrushchev - who himself had an important role in the political oppression of the Great Terror - made a move which ultimately had an enormous influence on Stalin's image. During the 20th Party congress, in order to consolidate his own power, the new leader of the USSR denounced the crimes of his former boss and the cult of personality he enjoyed during his reign. His speech and was a shock for communists in Europe who were now more divided than ever, but liberals could only rejoice. The USSR's two main assets in Western Europe were subsequently fragmented. The Italian communist party sought domestic political integration, while the French communist party was paralyzed. The Congress triggered the beginning of a crisis of confidenceregarding the Soviet Union. In a way, one can look at Krushchev's political maneuver against Stalin's image as the first blow to the entire Soviet structure.", "Stalin's reputation would continue deteriorating as dissidents published books in the West, and his former Western intellectual admirers were denounced for their blindness. Furthermore, it is true that Stalin won a political victory over Trotsky, but the latter is better judged by history. Trotsky is now considered more as an intellectual and a victim, regardless of the atrocities he committed when in power - particularly in his Ukrainian homeland - and his ideas have not vanished. Irving Kristol, the \"godfather of neoconservatism\" in the USA, was a former Trotskyist, and the political views of the architects and proponents of globalized financial capitalism mesh with Trotsky's internationalist views. Whereas Stalin, with the disappearance of communist parties as propaganda tools and the fall of the Soviet Union, has simply become another bogeyman. It is still possible to encounter Western Stalinists, but those are usually Marxist intellectuals with no influence on the broader public.", "Ivan the Terrible has been considered a monster for many centuries, because of his ruthlessness in internal politics, but also down to howhe conquered vast territories and became a threat to the West's own imperialism. The fact that he was a very important reformer is somehow ignored. Peter the Great, was no softer, but on the contrary, he is considered an interesting personality mainly because he opened \"a window to Europe\" and incorporated Western elements into Russian civilization. When it comes to Stalin and Trotsky, Western views favor the internationalist. Gorbachev and Yeltsin, with their wish to adapt to Western standards, are also considered \"good\" Russian leaders. Currently, the Western position has moved in the other direction with Vladimir Putin in power, who stated with his Munich speech back in 2007, that the times of a weak Russia were over.", "The Georgian is maybe the only one who has managed to be the object of both praise and loathing from the West. Stalin had become a problem for liberal democratic propaganda during the war. Just as Soviet agitprophad to justify its sudden alliance with capitalist countries, the Anglo-Saxon mediahad to explain why Stalin was a great statesman and a good ally. Pro-Soviet movies were produced, on the personal request of the American president, and the feature film \"Mission to Moscow\" was created in order to justify the purges. Stalin was twice named Time magazine's \"Person of the year\" within three years, and even the publication of George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" was postponed. A positively biased campaign was actively nurtured around him.", "Only progressively, during the Cold War, did the narrative change. However, it was very difficult to put Stalin in the same basket as Hitler, since the war had cost the USSR the death of roughly 27 million people and gave it a place at the table of victors. Traditionally, victors are the ones who write and rewrite history, but 70 years later, the West is more confident in its capacity to rewrite the storyof the 20th century. And Stalin is more often now presented as an accomplice of Hitler who helped him organize chaos and terror in Europe.", "Something which is clearly nonsense.", "This apparently incoherent attitude is better explained if we examine the power structures in liberal democracies. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the West has developed a system in which strong incarnations of power are not desired.By 1900, according to the American philosopher Sheldon Wolin, the US was already living under an \"inverted totalitarianism\", that is to say a system where corporations and lobbyists rule while the government acts as a servant. In his famous 1928 book \"Propaganda\", Edward Bernays explained: \"The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.\"", "If Bernays's conclusions are correct, it implies that the Western system doesn't need statesmen and political reformers with a vision for specific nations but administrators and managers with short mandates. Angela Merkel's 16 year tenure marks a notable exception in contemporary liberal democracies. However, Merkel has working as part of the European Union, with its sophisticated institutions, and heavy bureaucracy. This may explain why the length of her time in office has never been criticized, whereas the West frequently expresses its concern towards men like Putin or Xi remaining inoffice for long periods.", "However, as various crises have shown, liberal democracies temporarily embrace \"strongmen\" when it fits the political agenda. Pierre Conesa, a French specialist in geostrategy, is the author of 'The fabrication of the enemy' and 'Hollywar: Hollywood, weapon of mass propaganda'. He explains how Western messaging resorts to a fickle cinematographic process of demonizing its enemy and presenting its side as heroic.

Therefore, all decisions of the West to disconnect Russian banks from SWIFT, as well as Visa and Mastercard systems, have absolutely no impact on our domestic operations and payments...

If you look, for example, at the volume of our hydrocarbon production last year, not only did it not shrink, but it grew,\" he stated.", "Siluanov noted that in fact the process of reorienting the Russian market towards self-sufficiency started back in 2014, when the country first faced Western sanctions over the reunification with Crimea.", "\"We have already been through all this.

The title of the essay,Russophobia as a malignant tumor in the United States, is, admittedly, provocative - as all good, thought-provoking titles should be.

Culture must always remain the bridge for strengthening trust between the peoples, however complicated the relations between the states may be.\"", "\"There was no \"cancellation of culture\" even during the Cold War. A lesser-known fact is that the first Tchaikovsky International Competition in 1958 was won by Van Cliburn, an outstanding pianist and U.S. national. His sensational performance in Moscow at the height of the Cold War helped break down barriers and gave hope for finding mutual understanding based on love for classical music.\"", "The story of how Harvey Lavan \"Van\" Cliburn, a tall, curly-haired Texan pianist, conquered Moscow is legendary. By 1958, US-Soviet relations were tense, impacted as they were by the politics of the Cold War. To promote a thaw in relations, the Soviets and Americans proposed a series of cultural exchanges. The Soviets, for their part, convened the first International Tchaikovsky Piano Competition, named after the famous Russian composer,Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.", "Tchaikovsky is perhaps best known in the United States for his rousing1812 Overture, the melodicNutcracker Suite, once a Christmas staple, and the unforgettableSwan Lakeballet. The premise of the competition was to invite 50 musicians from 19 countries to compete in an international competition designed to highlight Soviet accomplishment in the arts. A distinguished jury, headed byDmitry Shostakovich, a legendary composer in his own right, was convened to judge the competition.", "Cliburn was one of several Americans invited to compete. His rendition of Tchaikovsky's first piano concerto, considered one of his most popular compositions and, as such, familiar to all, leaving little room for error or misinterpretation, brought the crowd to its feet. Olga Kern, one of Russia's finest classical pianists, said of the performance, \"Van Cliburn won because he played in a grand way. Soaring. It was beautiful; the piano was singing. It sounded so new and fresh. It was incredible.\"", "Popular legend has it that Shostakovich was uncertain whether he could award first prize to an American. When the famed Soviet composer approached Nikita Khrushchev for advice, the Soviet leader asked, \"Is he the best?\" Shostakovich replied yes to which Khruschev announced, \"Then give him the prize!\"", "Van Cliburn returned to America a hero and was given a ticker-tape parade down New York City's Avenue of Heroes, the only musician ever to be so honored. Time Magazine put him on its cover, with the headline, \"The Texan Who Conquered Russia.\"", "Six months prior to Van Cliburn's achievement, the Soviets had put the world's first satellite, Sputnik, into orbit, an act that left many Americans feeling vulnerable and uncertain. The country still reeled from the Red Scare politics of Senator Joe McCarthy, whose admonition that \"you cannot offer friendship to tyrants and murderers... without advancing the cause of tyranny and murder\" continued to resonate in certain circles even after his death in 1957.", "Van Cliburn's performance did, in fact, help \"break down barriers\" and give \"hope for finding mutual understanding.\" There's no lie in the essay penned by the Russian diplomat.", "\"Cultural cooperation,\"the Ambassador's essay noted, \"helped melt the ice then. Its significance cannot be overestimated also in our days because the universal language of art unites people of different nationalities, whatever is going on in the realm of big politics.\"", "It was, in short, an historic event, one worthy of continued attention and recognition. And, largely because of the singular accomplishment of Van Cliburn, the International Tchaikovsky Competition went on to become one of the best-known and most respected music competitions in the world.", "\"The competition,\" the essay observed, \"was excluded from the World Federation of International Music Competitions in 2022 amidst indiscriminate Russophobia.\"", "This, too, is a true statement. On April 13, 2022, the World Federation of International Music Competitions voted by an overwhelming majority to exclude the International Tchaikovsky Competition from its membership. In a press release the federation declared that \"Many laureates of the Tchaikovsky Competition are among the leading artists of today. However, in the face of Russia's brutal war and humanitarian atrocities in Ukraine, the [federation] as an apolitical organization cannot support or have as a member, a competition financed and used as a promotional tool by the Russian regime.\"", "In 2003, following the invasion of Iraq by the United States - an act widely acknowledged worldwide as a blatant act of aggression that violated international law, the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, one of six American music competitions that are part of a network of some 120 internationally recognized organizations that comprise the federation, and whose collective goal is to \"discover the most promising young talents in classical music through public competition,\" was not excluded by the World Federation of International Music Competitions.", "So much for the \"apolitical\" status of the federation. The exclusion by the federation of the International Tchaikovsky Competition is an inherently political act, a clear example of Russophobia. To pretend otherwise is illogical - but then again, Russophobia(\"the fear or dislike of Russia and its people, often based on stereotypes and propaganda\"), like all other phobias, is inherently illogical, representing as it doesan excessive, extreme, irrational, fear or panic reaction derived from ignorance of the subject in question.", "\"And yet,\" Antonov declared, \"despite that, representatives of the United States still seek to become laureates and winners of this prestigious contest. The 2023 Tchaikovsky International Youth Competition, by the way, was attended by 128 gifted performers from 14 countries, including the United States.\"", "Again, not a false statement - the XI International Tchaikovsky Competition for Young Musicians was held in Moscow and St. Petersburg in January 2023. There, 27 young musicians from Russia, China, the Republic of Koreaand the United Stateswere selected for participation in the final round. The top two spots were awarded to competitors from China, while the third spot went to a Russian performer.

And yet, even here, Russophobia has raised its ugly head, as the Russian essay so pointedly notes. \"The anti-Russian 'hate virus' is giving metastases and continues to affect the United States,\" the essay states. \"It has also infected the leading US art galleries that are now trying to outdo each other in their efforts to 'cancel' Russian culture.", "\"The Metropolitan Museum of Art,\" Ambassador Antonov reports, \"has reclassified great Russian painters Arkhip Kuindzhi, Ivan Aivazovsky and Ilya Repin as Ukrainians guided by the fact that they were born in Mariupol, Feodosia and Chuguev, which is nothing short of a complete absurdity.\"", "Once again, the assertion put forward in the essay is factually correct. \"The Met continually researches and examines objects in its collection in order to determine the most appropriate and accurate way to catalogue and present them,\" a Met spokesperson said, commenting on the reclassification. \"The cataloguing of these works has been updated following research conducted in collaboration with scholars in the field.\"", "The \"collaboration\" the Met speaks of came in the form of online pressure from someone the Met described as a Ukrainian art historian, Oksana Semenik, whose Twitter account, Ukrainian Art History (@ukr_arthistory) ran a concerted campaign criticizing the Met for incorrectly labelling the works of Arkhip Kuindzhi as Russian. \"All his famous landscapes were about Ukraine, Dnipro, and steppes,\" Semenik tweeted. \"But also about Ukrainian people.\"", "All his famous landscapes were about Ukraine, Dnipro, and steppes. But also about Ukrainian people.

Just in case: ethnically, Ilya Repin was Russian, Ivan Aivazovsky was Armenian and Arkhip Kuindzhi was Greek. All three were born in the Russian Empire - when Ukrainian statehood did not exist.\"", "Kuindzhi was a landscape painter from the Russian Empire of Pontic Greek origin. When he was born, in 1841, the city of Mariupol was one of the subdivisions of the Yekaterinoslav Governorate of the Russian Empire. The landscapes he painted, at the time they were produced, depicted Russian scenes, and Russian people. Kuindzhi, by any account, was a Russian artist.", "While Ivan Aivazovsky may have been ethnically Armenian, he and all of Russia considered (and considers) him to be an iconic Romantic painter who is considered one of the greatest masters of marine art of all time. Indeed, several of Aivazovsky's works hang in Ambassador Antonov's residence in Washington, DC.", "Prior to the reclassification, the Met described Aivazovsky as such: \"The Russian Romantic artist Ivan Konstantinovich Aivazovsky (1817-1900) was widely renowned for his paintings of sea battles, shipwrecks, and storms at sea. Born into an Armenian family in the Crimean port city of Feodosia, Aivazovsky was enormously prolific-he claimed to have created some six thousand paintings during his lifetime. He was a favorite of Tsar Nicholas I and was appointed official artist of the Russian imperial navy.\"", "As for Ilya Repin, his father had served in an Uhlan Regiment in the Russian army, and Repin was a graduate of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in Saint Petersburg.", "The Russophobia of the Met did not stop there. As Antonov's essay notes, \"Another example of ignorance by the Met is the renaming of Edgar Degas's 'Russian Dancers' to 'Dancers in Ukrainian Dress'.\"", "This is true. Moreover, in introducing the work the Met declared, \"In 1899, Degas produced a series of compositions devoted to dancers in Ukrainian folk dress,\" ignoring the fact that Degas himself named the drawings \"Russian Dancers,\" thereby reflecting the reality that he was devoting his drawings to dancers in Russian folk dress.", "But historical accuracy is not, apparently, what the Met aspires to. As Ambassador Antonov explains, \"Moreover, a comment added beneath the picture now reads: 'The subject reflects the surge of French interest in the art and culture of Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire, following France's political alliance with that Empire in 1894'. Those who came up with this idea did not bother to figure out that it wasdancers of the Russian Imperial Ballet on tour in Paris who inspired the French impressionist to create the masterpiece. It is na\u00efve to imagine,\" the Ambassador notes caustically, \"that the artist was familiar with 'the great Ukrainian choreographic school'.\"", "Anatoly Antonov lambasts the decisions of the Met to cancel Russian art history in the name of virtue signaling. \"The American Museum of Modern Art,\" his essay notes, \"has also yielded to the derangement, dedicating a permanent-collection gallery to works by 'ethnic Ukranians'. Titled 'In Solidarity', it features pieces by Kazimir Malevich, Leonid Berlyavsky-Nevelson, Sonia Delaunay-Terk and Ilya Kabakov.\"", "Kazimir Malevich was an ethnic Pole, born in Kiev in 1879, and widely considered a leading Russian avant-garde artist and art theorist. Malevich's pioneering work had a profound influence on the development of abstract art in the 20th century. His art, and associated politics, ran afoul of Joseph Stalin, and Malevich suffered persecution at the hands of the KGB, before dying in Leningrad in 1935.", "The Ukrainian art historian-turned-activist, Oksana Semenik, led an online campaign to have the Met reclassify Malevich as Ukrainian. \"Russian art critics who had access to the KGB archives,\" she tweeted, without referencing either the art critic or the archival material in question, \"note that Malevich answered that he was Ukrainian when asked about his nationality.\"", "Russian art critics who had access to the KGB archives note that Malevich answered that he was Ukrainian when asked about his nationality.'Self Portrait', 1910 pic.twitter.com/SOU2VtIihx", "Semenik went on to tweet, \"So, @MuseumModernArt, how about making corrections about his true nationality? It will be a present for his birthday (note: Malevich was born on February 23.)\"", "A modicum of due diligence, however, of the sort one would expect from an institution such as The Metropolitan Museum of Art, where assiduous accuracy in the pursuit of art history is the norm, not the exception, appears to be lacking in the case of Ms. Semenik.", "Far from a simple art historian, Semenik is what she calls a \"cultural journalist\" whose articles have been published in outlets such asThe New Statesman, a British political and cultural magazine with a decidedly pro-Ukraine, anti-Russia editorial bias. On April 4, 2022,The New Statesmanpublished an article authored by Semenik entitled \"I escaped Russian atrocities in Bucha. My neighbors weren't so lucky.\"", "The account of Ms. Semenik is what it is, and it is important to note that she provides no first-hand observations of so-called \"Russian atrocities.\" What is more interesting is her naming of her partner, Sashko Popenko, and the name of the person who edited and translated the article into English,Nataliya Gumenyuk. Both are journalists working for the Public Interest Journalism Lab, which in 2022 was awarded the Democracy Award from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), an organization formed in 1983 during the Reagan administration to assume control of CIA programs operating overseas designed to influence international public-private opinions and policies. The NED is funded by an annual grant from the United States Information Agency, and receives direct tasking from the US Congress regarding specific countries of interest to the United States. Ukraine has been designated as such a country.", "In 2015, the NED was banned in Russia under a law targeting so-called \"undesirable\" international organizations.", "It is not my position to question the motives of either Ms. Semenik, Ms. Gemenyuk, the Public Interest Journalism Lab, or the NED.", "Likewise, Russian domestic policy is a matter for Russia and those impacted by it, including the NED.", "However, one cannot pretend to turn a blind eye, as the Met does, to the fact that its most ardent proponent for the cultural cancellation of Russia in the Met is not a simple Ukrainian \"art historian,\" but rather an activist affiliated with a partisan Ukrainian organization that receives funding from a US government-controlled agency.", "By acting on Ms. Semenik's passions regarding the re-classification of longstanding Russian artists as Ukrainian (something The Kyiv Post has described as the \"Decolonization of Ukrainian art\"), the Met has allowed itself to become, wittingly or otherwise, a de facto tool of anti-Russian propaganda.", "This is not the proper role of a major American cultural institution.", "Here I will let the anger and frustration of the Russian Ambassador to the United States manifest itself without comment:", "\"Judging by the rhetoric of the American art beau monde, Vasily Kandinsky, a native of Moscow, and his works are next in line to be 'Ukrainized'.

Isn't this sudden \"revelation\" just a banal tribute to political fashion? Anyway, the time will come for the US cultural elite to sober up and be embarrassed of its doings.\"", "Perhaps. But the reality is that what passes for culture today in America is anything but, especially when it comes to all things Russia. Liquor stores have poured \"Russian\" vodka out in protest of the Russian military incursion into Ukraine, ignorant of the fact that many of the brands they were disposing of originated from places other than Russia.", "Other absurdities abound. The Mari Vanna, a well-known Washington, DC-based Russian restaurant, has renamed the famous \"Moscow Mule\" mixed drink (two parts vodka, three parts ginger ale, and a squeeze of lime juice)into the \"Kyiv (sic) Mule,\" and the long-time Russian staple, borscht, has been redefined as \"the masterpiece of Ukrainian cuisine.\"", "But the culture war against all things Russian has serious connotations as well. The Russia House, an established Washington, DC-based Russian restaurant, was vandalized in the weeks following the Russian incursion into Ukraine, leading the owners to shutter their doors for good (the restaurant, like many others, had temporarily closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.)", "In New York City, the iconic Russian Samovar restaurant came under attack simply because of its name, forcing the owners to fly Ukrainian flags and profess their open support for Ukraine, lest they, too, be subject to attacks that would derail their business.", "It is not just Russian culture that is being cancelled in the US, but Russian people, including those dispatched by the Russian government for the singular task of improving relations between the two countries.

Nevertheless, US politicians not only encourage hatred of everything Russian, but actively implant it in the minds of citizens. In recent years, they have never stopped fabricating baseless accusations to justify tougher sanctions.\"", "One of the problems confronting the Russian government and people today is the quality of individuals that comprise what passes for \"Russia experts\" in America today. Gone are the days when men such as Jack Matlock, the former US Ambassador to Russia, or Stephen Cohen, the lateProfessor Emeritus of Russian and Slavic Studies who taught at Columbia, Princeton, and New York University, walkedthe halls of academia and power. Both men possessed a deep appreciation of Russian history, culture, traditions, language, and politics. Erudite and tough, they articulated for better relations between Russia and the US.", "Today, they have been replaced by people like Michael McFaul, the former US Ambassador to Russia under Barack Obama, and Fiona Hill, a National Security Council \"expert\" on Russia in both the Obama and Trump White Houses. Both McFaul and Hill have expressed a Putin-centric approach when assessing Russia, where everything is explained through an incomplete and narrowly focused concentration on the Russian leader over the Russian nation.", "The contrast between the approaches taken by Matlock and Cohen, on the one hand, an McFaul and Hill, on the other, could not be more stark; the formerargued for bridging the differences through better understanding, and thelatter for managing differences through confrontation and attempted isolation.", "One approach promotes peaceful coexistence based upon principles of shared humanity.", "The other promotes never-ending conflict fueled by Russophobia.

The Soviet Union had long insisted on including those two countries' nuclear arsenals in the US ceilings, and only relented during Gorbachev's perestroika. With Paris and London taking an active role in the proxy war in Ukraine, Moscow is no longer pretending that UK and French nuclear forces are there solely to defend their own countries.

Likewise, US President Joe Biden himself has ordered the application removed from all federally owned devices, a move which has been copied by some other Western countries.", "The claim is, because TikTok is \"Chinese-owned,\" it must be a \"national security risk.\" The most hawkish US senators, such as Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio, have never disguised their intentions to have it banned completely in the United States, and who can forget that the Trump administration already attempted to do so but was unsuccessful after the move waschallenged in court?", "Of course, there isn't any serious evidence of a \"security risk\" posed by TikTok - only guilt by association, since the app is Chinese.

Apparently, that is not enough to stop the tide of paranoia sweeping in its direction.", "The reality? The US just isn't rational when it comes to dealing with China. American political culture is deeply affected by 'McCarthyist' scaremongering, and when there are not enough solid facts available to justify an aggressive political decision, such decisions are made based on emotional statements. These emotional statements are most often related to fear or hatred, and trumped up as necessary to manufacture public consent.

First, it is because, as much as it is a hugely successful Chinese application, the reality is that the stakes of TikTok's success are not strategic. It does not alter the balance of power between the US or China in a dynamic which can have military implications, at least not in a way that something such as semiconductors can. Secondly, such a ban can have shocking reverberations for freedom of speech and there is a serious argument that it may be unconstitutional. Case in point, the previous attempts to ban Chinese applications by the Trump administration, including WeChat and TikTok itself, were blocked in the courts. This sets a precedent regardless of any bill the US Congress may pass.", "Given this, it is clear that the obsession over TikTok is nothing more than collective mass hysteria, the same mass hysteria which pervades all things related to China in the US today.
