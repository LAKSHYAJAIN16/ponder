Its attendees are of a certain kind; the kind willing to drop $300 for a ticket and much more on travel and accommodations, to attend a four day feast on GOP red meat. They are either superfans or selling something, whether it's a product, a policy, a cause. The superfans are an important constituent part of the base, but not indicative of the whole-typically boomers. The salesmen make up an eclectic bazaar, fellow travelers of the \"big tent\" party wherever it goes. Media row has its stars-Steve Bannon, Donald Trump Jr., and the like-but it's mostly c-list conservative media influencers flaunting themselves down media row pitching interviews to radio shows no one has ever heard of. The superfan, salesman, and media stars all have a few things in common: they love America and hate wokeness and the liberal media.", "The low common denominator makes for a low bar-a ballroom of conservative boomers is an environment where any Republican presidential candidate should do well; even Nikki Haley.

Think about it. I'm a woman. I'm a minority. I'm the daughter of immigrants. I am proof that liberals are wrong about everything they say about America.\"", "Haley might think this now, but it won't be long until they'll use her bid for the GOP nomination as proof that they were right all along: When Haley's presidential campaign spectacularly fails, it will be because the Republican base is sexist, racist, or xenophobic-most likely all three. CNN's Don Lemon is already laying the groundwork for this narrative, suggesting the former South Carolina governor is no longer \"in her prime,\" which could serve to her detriment.", "The former U.N. ambassador had her own message for Lemon: \"Hold my beer.\" Only a few laughed-even the Boomers knew the meme didn't really fit.

Furthermore, she suggested that Trump's populist message wasn't popular enough. \"We've lost the popular vote in the last seven out of eight presidential elections,\" Haley said. \"Our cause is right, but we have failed to win the confidence of a majority of Americans.

Google", "Based on oral arguments that took place last week, it seems unlikely.", "But something important did surface from the back and forth between the arguing attorneys and the Supreme Court justices: Large technology platforms such as Google and its YouTube platform have the power not only to organize the world's information, but to shape it. With their wide reach and complex algorithms, Big Tech platforms can influence the behavior of their millions of users, including voters.", "The ultimate question, unlikely to be addressed by the Court in the Gonzalez case, is how far Big Tech monopolies can be allowed to extend their influence over us before they face legal consequences.", "Gonzalez", "Which brings us to the awful facts of the Gonzalez case. On November 13, 2015, Nohemi Gonzalez, a twenty-three-year-old U.S. citizen studying in Paris, France, was eating at a caf\u00e9 when three ISIS terrorists, including Abdelhamid Abaaoud, sprayed bullets into the crowd and shot Gonzalez, resulting in her death. The shooting was part of a broader series of attacks perpetrated by ISIS in Paris that day.", "Gonzalez", "What does any of that have to do with Google? Apparently, ISIS regularly used YouTube for terror recruitment purposes. More than a year and a half before the attack, Abaaoud, one of the attackers who killed Gonzalez, had appeared in an ISIS YouTube video trying to raise jihadi fighters to join ISIS.", "The Gonzalez family sued Google under a federal statute that provides a civil remedy to victims of terrorism in suits against any defendant-in this case, Google-that aids and abets terrorism, or provides \"material support\" to terror groups. The family's suit alleged Google was aware that ISIS was using its YouTube platform, that Google's algorithms had \"recommended ISIS videos\" like Abaaoud's to users, and the service allowed ISIS supporters to communicate about the content of the videos. Even though Google had the ability to effectively block them, the family asserts, the company failed to do so.", "Enter Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a congressional provision that gives near-complete civil immunity to tech companies such as Google. According to Google's lawyers, Section 230, which was enacted in 1996, should be read as a near-absolute shield against treating them like any other \"publisher.\" If The American Conservative printed defamation, for instance, it could be held liable. But not so for Google, as long we are talking about user-generated content that Google allows on its platform.", "The American Conservative", "Here is the tricky part. Should YouTube's suggestions to users encouraging them to check out ISIS videos make them responsible for the damages to the Gonzalez family? A very broad reading of Section 230 would suggest not. But, what about the YouTube suggestions to the millions of users that helped spread ISIS's recruiting scheme?", "Previously, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in this case that such video suggestions were not a violation of Section 230. After all, the two majority judges wrote, the complex Google algorithms that trigger YouTube video suggestions are simply \"neutral tools\" in the maze of the Big Tech company's digital universe.", "At the Supreme Court, that issue was woven throughout the arguments in some twenty different exchanges. Algorithms, some of the justices noted, just might be skewed in non-neutral ways to cause harm. Justice Barrett questioned Google's attorney Lisa Blatt about algorithms that categorize information in discriminatory ways. Blatt hedged, but seemed to concede that such practices would be outside of Section 230 protection.", "Overall, the justices were unified in their occasional confusion about how to approach these issues. Much of their confusion stemmed from Section 230 itself, which was passed by Congress almost 30 years ago, an eternity in terms of today's technological advancement. Back then, there was no Google, Twitter, YouTube, or Facebook, and the average American surfed the internet only about thirty minutes a month. The internet was unrecognizable.", "Now, we are in a bold new world, and are not privy to the internal coding decisions reflected in Google and YouTube's algorithms.

Supposed AI wunderkind ChatGPT has already exhibited \"left-leaning political biases,\" refusing to report on the Hunter Biden laptop story in the \"style\" of the New York Post. The automated program responded to questions from the Post with this remarkable confession: \"it is possible that some of the texts that I have been trained on may have a left-leaning bias.\" More remarkable is how quickly the AI system admitted the bias of its programmers. It took an appearance before congressional committees before Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey were willing to make similar confessions about their platforms.", "New York Post", "Post", "But even with all the controversy over algorithmic bias, the American economy remains inexorably tied to technology. When Google's lawyer Lisa Blatt was questioned by Justice Alito regarding whether her tech clients would \"collapse\" if they had to face civil liability for permitting defamatory content on their platforms, she replied, \"Every other website might ... because they're not as big as Google.\"", "Blatt's response was a significant concession that the largest companies are more than capable of surviving exposure to civil liability. It follows, therefore, that the market-dominant giants, the \"big\" ones such as Google (and its YouTube), Meta (Facebook and Instagram), Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft, would not be disabled if Congress were to amend Section 230 in ways that would impose stricter forms of liability on them but not on smaller tech companies.", "not ", "American Principles Project has advocated just that as a legislative approach, focusing on the market-dominant giants who use monopoly power to exercise viewpoint-biased control over citizen speech, while protecting vibrant growth among start-ups and mid-level competitive hopefuls.", "It's possible that the Supreme Court will follow Justice Gorsuch, who noted that Gonzalez v. Google could be remanded back to lower courts to reconsider its flawed neutral-algorithms assumption.

Forbes is really talented, said my friend -- meaning that she might well be able to lead Scotland to secession.", "That looks unlikely to happen now. Why? Because Kate Forbes, 32, is a Presbyterian -- and a real one, not one of the woke ones. Her views on trans matters -- she opposes the idea that men can be women simply because they claim to be -- were well known. She was asked her feelings about same-sex marriage, which is legal in Scotland. She said she opposed it for faith reasons, but said that as far as she's concerned, it's a settled issue, and if she became SNP leader, she would not seek to reverse it. She also said that thinks having children out of wedlock is a bad idea. Watch the whole video interview here. ", "That did it. She's now History's Greatest Monster. Surprisingly and wonderfully, Kathleen Stock, the distinguished academic and lesbian who was driven out of her college for being gender-critical, rises to Forbes's defense in UnHerd. Excerpts:", "Rather, Forbes's words have been seized upon because they help prop up adherence to a different sort of modern dogma: the rainbow religion promulgated in the name of the amorphous \"LGBTQI+\" people. Like Christianity, this centres on the figure of a sacred, innocent outsider, beset on all sides by hatred but turning the other cheek, and freeing people from their traditional ways of life by lived example.", "Alongside the idea that you can reinvent yourself at any time, it's one of the fundamental tenets of this value system that LGBTQI+ people are still actively persecuted across the board in modern Britain, with no room for further nuance about who exactly, or under what circumstances, or what the hell some of those letters even stand for anyway. Hundreds of public and third-sector organisations and enterprises are invested in this exceptionally simple story. Indeed, some of them make a lot of money from it. Thousands of employee hours have been spent in HR training sessions, listening to ropey statistics that represent perceptions of persecution among gay and trans people as fact. At this stage, there is such collective national investment in thinking of LGBTQI+ people as severely oppressed that one obscurely fears a lightning strike even to raise a question about it.", "More:", "Of course, in practice, no-one criticising her has any idea whether Forbes is a genuine homophobe or not. Another facile equation made by those religiously invested in victimhood for LGBTQI+ people is that any objection to liberalisation must be rooted in some kind of \"phobia\". In practice, like everyone else, Christians range from kind, tolerant, and generous people to bigoted nutcases, with many shades of grey in between.", "But Forbes is unlikely to be given the benefit of the doubt. To do so would be to squander a rare chance to perpetuate the hysterical fantasy that LGBTQI+ people in Britain, generally, are permanently a hair's breadth away from malicious destruction - even as the Equality Act explicitly protects both gay and trans people, the BBC hosts dozens of positive stories about trans youth, millions of pounds roll into charity coffers, gay men rule entertainment telly, lesbians rule women's sport, and entire classrooms change their pronouns to the delight of their teachers.", "As I say, what we have here is a clash of two religions. One of them is full of sanctimonious, swivel-eyed moral scolds, rooting out heresy and trying to indoctrinate everybody into their fantastic way of thinking. The other is a branch of Calvinism. One of them asks \"what would Jesus do?\" and the other \"what would Owen Jones think?\".

It is sufficient that they think the Wrong Thoughts\u2122 to drive them out. Remember the Law of Merited Impossibility? It says, \"It will never happen, and when it does, you bigots will deserve it.\" Back in 2006, people like me were called alarmists, and were asked, \"How does my gay neighbors' marriage hurt me?\" by people who didn't actually want an answer. Well, the fate of Kate Forbes is part of the answer. It was baked into the cake from the beginning. Why? Because if same-sex marriage (and transgenderism) are civil rights, and human rights, then to oppose them is to be guilty of the equivalent of racism. You can explain all day long how sexuality and gender are not like race, and it won't matter. Nobody wants to hear it. And as Stock understands, the success of the LGBT lobby depends on keeping everybody believing the lie that LGBT people are on the verge of being sent to the camps by Christians in what is fast becoming one of the world's most secular societies. ", "Back in 2015, a well-known Evangelical pastor friend told me that when he would be invited to guest-preach in churches, he would tell congregations that the day is fast coming in which they will all be seen as no better than Klansmen for believing what the Bible says about sexuality, and what most Americans believed until the day before yesterday. He said they could not bring themselves to believe him. They just couldn't. I told him back then that I knew the feeling. He and I both spent a lot of time in our lives moving among liberal elites, and understood their mindset. Normie Christians found it impossible to accept that this was going to happen to our country.", "What has happened to Kate Forbes is going to come to America. It already has to some extent. Ask yourself: would anybody who believes what Kate Forbes believes be able to rise to leadership in the Democratic Party, even if she was a staunch advocate of its economic policies, and even if she said she would not support political action to reverse same-sex marriage? Of course not. There might be some Olds in the Democratic Party at the senior level who believe that, but they say nothing, they downplay it. The real question twenty or thirty years from now will be whether it is possible to be Kate Forbes as a Republican. ", "This is a religious war. The other side does not want tolerance. They never did. Even those among them who advocate sincerely for tolerance are on the margins of the movement. It's a movement that takes scalps. In the meantime, we on the conservative side are cursed by normie Republicans like Mike Pompeo, Mike Pence, and Larry Hogan, all of whom criticize Gov.

Madison himself is now missing at Montpelier, as there are no exhibits dedicated to his significant accomplishments. The sole exhibit for children aims to teach them about race and slavery. This is done through books featuring \"imagination exercises\" for blacks and whites; one such exercise encourages children to imagine themselves not as the victim, but as the aggressor, whipping a fellow human being.

Diversity and inclusion are two of their core values, and their Black Lives Matter statement asserts that historic preservation must \"actively advance justice and equity\" and \"confront and address structural racism within our own institutions.\" The Trust has $412 million in assets. The U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Secretary of the Interior serve on their board, and they lobby to influence how taxpayer preservation funds are spent.", "Another notable organization within the space is the American Alliance of Museums (AAM), an alliance of 35,000 museums and museum professionals.

They believe that museums should not just depict and preserve history, but also \"champion an anti-racist movement\" to create a \"more just and equitable world.\" Promoting diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion (DEAI) and anti-racism is one of their four strategic priorities. The alliance recently assembled a task force of museum leaders, co-chaired by Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie Bunch, to embed DEAI practices across the industry. The resulting report begins: \"DEAI is integral to excellence in museum practice. FULL STOP.\" The report further recommends that leaders and museum experts shift away from \"white-dominant characteristics of perfection, risk aversion, and conflict avoidance.\"", "At the end of the report, the task force endorses additional resources, including Montpelier's and the National Trust's guidelines for teaching slavery and engaging descendants (which encompasses anyone who feels \"connected to the work the institution is doing, whether or not they know of a genealogical connection\"). In those guidelines, Montpelier and the National Trust contend, ", "For institutions that interpret slavery, it is not enough simply to discuss the humanity and contributions of the enslaved. It is imperative that these institutions also unpack and interrogate white privilege and supremacy and systemic racism.", "Influential individuals and corporations are supporting these groups with considerable resources. The AAM's DEAI working group was co-chaired by a representative of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, which in 2020 launched a $250 million Monuments Project \"to reimagine and rebuild commemorative spaces and transform the way history is told in the United States.\" The Excellence in DEAI report by the task force was made possible by Mellon, Alice C. Walton, and the Ford Foundation. McKinsey & Company acted as a pro-bono partner to produce the AAM's Strategic Framework that prioritizes DEAI and anti-racism. The National Trust's African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund also received funding from Ford, Mellon, and others, including George Soros's Open Society Foundations.", "Museum leaders and employees are exploiting the symbolic value of the sites under their stewardship. The chairman of the board at Montpelier has remarked that people go there to \"worship\" a president and a document, and that Montpelier should \"leverage the meaning that [Montpelier] holds for the nation and for the world,\" \"reinterpret an iconic institution,\" and \"challenge its history.\" Montpelier's longstanding director of archaeology reportedly said that he \"had no interest in honoring a 'dead white president and a dead white president's Constitution,'\" and \"that he needed to act 'less like a bulldozer and more like a termite that undermined a building's foundation, destroying it from within before tearing it down.'\"", "At an annual conference hosted by the American Association for State and Local History, participants were brainstorming about how to protect Critical Race Theory in classrooms.

The only way it could succeed is through tyranny. If you aren't going to resort to tyranny -- imagine Adrian Vermeule with Xi Jinping's surveillance state apparatus! -- then you end up back at evangelism and persuasion.

Instead, Biden and Mayorkas essentially threw out the authorized refugee process, which they considered too slow and too limiting, to invent their own speedy but unlawful \"new paths\" that simply deem selected foreign nationalities as refugees and admit them. Therefore, almost all of Biden-Mayorkas migrants that Welcome.US is sponsoring do not even meet the U.S. government legal definition of \"refugee.\"", "The existing system was designed to create a manageable process that is supported by a domestic political consensus and an internal resettlement capacity.

In fact, this campaign represents the full force of the country's mighty Immigration-Industrial Complex, mobilized and deployed, on a mission not only to win more migrants, but to defend against a coming policy counterattack, because it correctly fears the Biden-Mayorkas overreach is actually vulnerable to a great political rebuke.

The original proposal to amend the U.S. Constitution to include a clause to guarantee identical legal treatment of both sexes passed in 1972 with a seven-year ratification deadline. Despite extending the deadline to 1982, the ERA never received the requisite approval from 38 of the 50 state legislatures.", "Seeking to win some political points by resurrecting the dead amendment, Sen. Ben Cardin, the Maryland Democrat, has proposed a resolution, concurrent with a House resolution passed in 2021, to strike the ratification deadline from the text of the ERA, thus, presumably, reopening the amendment for passage by state legislatures. The Senate will debate the resolution Tuesday, an event that Democrats hope to keep at the bumper sticker level: Who doesn't value men and women equally?", "The amendment, however, does not pose the question of the equal inherent worth of men and women, as Cardin and his colleagues on the right and the left would have you believe. The question, instead, as most political ones, is one of prudence. Is it prudent to treat men and women identically-or, reframing it, to treat women as men? History, and most of the women in it, issue a resounding \"no.\"", "This was the argument, advanced by female lawyer Phyllis Schlafly, that beat the ERA the first time around. Schlafly posited that the differences between men and women are substantial enough that treating them as legally the same would have monstrous consequences for women. Rather than grant women greater \"equality,\" the ERA would revoke many of their legal privileges. In particular, the amendment would spell the end of all sex-segregated spaces-including prison, where even today most Americans still recognize the need to keep the male rapists out of female felons' cells. The draft was another concern, since the average service-age woman neither wants to be conscripted nor improves the effectiveness of a fighting force if she is.", "Treating women as men would harm certain material privileges currently afforded to women, too. Motherhood would be further penalized in the job market than it already is, particularly in terms of paid maternity leave: The net result of requiring equal compensation for both, as anyone may guess, is always less leave for women, not more leave for men, so long as businesses must make economizing decisions. (And if you thought those arguing for such egalitarianism were all on one side of the political aisle, refresh yourself on the Republican Party's talking points from last year's Equal Pay Day.)", "But perhaps the greatest loss to women is, once again, the degradation of men. Without the help of the ERA, women have come to rule practically every public sphere, from higher education to the boardroom, where even without a woman present, men feel the need to demonstrate their obeisance via self-censorship and passive aggression. When you treat women identically to men, it turns out, society merely adapts standards to favor more feminine characteristics, enabling women to succeed but feminizing men in the process. With the ERA in place, it's worth asking if any part of society would be permitted to exhibit the masculine virtues.", "But degraded men degrade the quality of women's lives, too, leaving both sexes dissatisfied. Our own eyes and ears tell us this, and if they didn't, a whole body of research on female hypergamy-not to mention the increasing number of unmarried women, and the fact that so many women have fewer children than they wish-does. Women who desired to rule over men are finding that, having in many ways achieved ascendancy, it is not so glorious as they had hoped. Rather than climb the corporate ladder to find satisfaction in work and an egalitarian partnership at home, they have found themselves as mid-level managers, with a landscape of potential male partners that are less than their equals-whether in education, earning potential, or social status. Meanwhile, the men who refuse to adapt to this feminine landscape are growing restive and even violent.", "It's a grim picture, but at least to those of us who spend significant time in the news, not entirely new. Indeed, much of what Schlafly and her compatriots feared would happen as a result of the ERA's passage-including abortion on demand and the legalization of same-sex unions-has already come to pass regardless of constitutional sanction; a primary purpose for passing the ERA today might simply be ex post facto justification for change that has already been forced, regardless of parchment barriers.", "ex post facto", "This does not mean we ought to roll over and take our lashings, however, until two wrongs make a right. Prudence demands something different: a rule of law that recognizes the differences between men and women, indeed even celebrates them, as a necessary foundation for flourishing.

And last week, Biden signed an executive order expanding the equity agenda items for several federal departments.", "For the Biden administration, equity serves two purposes. First, it compensates the descendants of historically marginalized groups. Second, it metes out retributive justice against the white majority.", "These purposes were made clear less than two months after Biden signed his first executive order. In March 2021, Biden signed a Covid relief package containing $4 billion in loan forgiveness exclusively for \"socially disadvantaged\" (that is, non-white) farmers. In the words of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, the minority-only relief package was enacted to \"acknowledge that acts of discrimination took place\" within the Department of Agriculture. ", "The department, though, had already made several expensive \"acknowledgements\" of that discrimination in the past. In 1997, the USDA reached what at the time was the largest civil rights settlement in American history, paying $2.3 billion to more than 30,000 farmers whom courts found to have been discriminated against by the agency between 1981 and 1996. In 1999, it doled out another $1.06 billion in cash relief, debt payments, and debt relief to other black class members. And in 2010, Congress agreed to pay out another $1.15 billion to specific victims of the agency's discriminatory lending practices.", "The victims of those policies had their days in court. The agency was made to pay substantial sums to those victims. Traditional notions of justice would insist that justice was served, since compensation for harm done should be limited to those specifically harmed. But the Biden administration instead demanded loan forgiveness for any farmer who happened to share the skin color of other farmers putatively discriminated against decades ago.", "When a group of white farmers excluded from the debt relief package sued the administration, Congress struck down and rewrote the provision to apply to all \"distressed\" farmers who had been \"discriminated\" against, regardless of their race. While this served the just purpose of reimbursing people with provable claims of discrimination, it failed to achieve the purpose of equity, which is to symbolically avenge past discrimination against minorities by actively discriminating against the majority in the present. As an NPR reporter put it: \"If [the relief program is] expanded beyond race, many Black farmers fear the program won't be effective in atoning for the USDA's racist history.\"", "And the USDA saga is just one example. Last week, we learned the Biden administration's \"equity agenda\" has expanded far beyond race-based reparations for black farmers. According to the latest executive order, several key federal departments will now be required to file public reports on their progress implementing the president's equity goals, set up \"Agency Equity Team[s]\" to oversee their departments' commitment to equity, and compile \"demographic data to advance equity\" so the administration can monitor their \"progress.\" ", "This data will be used to highlight disparities between groups-between black and white Americans, men and women, homosexuals and heterosexuals. And where disparities are found, equity will demand what the administration calls \"affirmatively advancing civil rights\"-that is, active discrimination.", "That's not hyperbole, but the stated purpose of equity. Progressives have argued for decades, but with particular vigor after the death of George Floyd, that legal colorblindness entrenches racial disparities. Where colorblindness is rooted in the principle of equality, equity is color-conscious , seeking not to avoid discrimination but rather to actively discriminate in favor of minority groups. As Ibram Kendi puts it, \"The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination.\"", "The latest executive order will only expand the reach of the equity principle in the federal government. Armed with statistics on inter-group disparities, the Biden administration will push the boundaries of America's notionally colorblind civil-rights regime to \"affirmatively\" favor minority groups in federal grant awards. Each department's annual equity report will be used to justify increasingly aggressive interventions in the workplace, schools, and other institutions where the administration can throw its weight around.

Balancing the nation's commitment to individualism with the realities of modern, scientifically informed mass medicine has proved to be a daunting challenge.

", "From its quintessentially Jeffersonian origins in the practices of unevenly trained independent physician-craftsmen, America's health care system would gradually incorporate more centralized Hamiltonian measures aimed at fostering medical expertise and making these services broadly available to its public. However, the resulting hybrid system represents the worst of both worlds, failing to provide either the freedom of a more decentralized Jeffersonian approach or the efficiencies of a more centralized Hamiltonian one. For the American health system to achieve its full potential, it must become more Jeffersonian in its approach to supplying care and more Hamiltonian in its approach to organizing it.", "From the American republic's outset, the medical environment differed significantly from the state-controlled models of continental Europe. While many physicians entered the profession through apprenticing under a more established practitioner, doing so was not a long-standing legal requirement as it was in France. And the United States certainly had no appetite for anything resembling Prussia's \"medical police\" tasked with enforcing health and medical standards. Care for the sick was largely delivered outside of hospitals by yeomen practitioners, mostly educated with a varying basis in the science of the time at commercial vocational schools. All of this was partly a reflection of the fact that the United States was still a young, largely agrarian country, but it was also a product of the Jeffersonian ideals, such as individual autonomy and limited government, that animated the country in the years after the revolution.", "Much in the same way that the Jeffersonian vision conflicted with Alexander Hamilton's goals of industrializing the young republic through state support, a similar conflict of visions brewed regarding the advancement of medicine itself. In contrast with the decentralized laissez-faire ideal associated with Jeffersonianism, the Hamiltonian approach is associated with an active government role in achieving broader societal objectives. As physicians academically trained in these institutions filtered throughout the country, momentum toward professionalization began to build, leading to the passage of licensure laws in states and cities up until the 1820s.", "Yet just as momentum was building for the professionalization of medicine, America entered a period of Jeffersonian backlash. This period, characterized by pervasive anti-elite and anti-monopoly sentiment throughout politics and society, began with the election of President Andrew Jackson in 1828. This backlash against established authority led to the de-licensure of many professions across the country, including medical professionals, and further progress toward licensure largely stalled out.", "This Jeffersonian backlash reflected the growing anti-authoritarian sentiment of the time. New religious movements, such as the Adventists and Latter-Day Saints, were taking shape during this period. Ralph Waldo Emerson's 1841 essay \"Self-Reliance\" illustrates the individualist currents of the time. These social currents, premised on the belief in the power of the individual to take control of their own well-being, certainly extended to matters of health. Alternative medical practitioners at odds with the academic medical orthodoxy rose in popularity during this period, such as Thomsonianism, eclecticism, and homeopathy. Americans' distrust of medical expertise was not entirely without basis either-the rudimentary medical techniques available at the time often exposed patients to greater health risks than the less invasive folk therapies on offer.", "entirely", "Whereas the trajectory of American medical professionalization at the turn of the century was not too dissimilar from England, the public skepticism, internal sectarianism, and political indifference that took root in the Jackson era had put the United States on a decidedly different path. While England would regularize its own physician workforce with the passage of the 1858 Medical Act, the same would not be achieved in the United States for another fifty years.", "The changing economic conditions in the years following the American Civil War aided the reconciliation of medical expertise with Americans' skepticism of concentrated power. As large corporations began to dominate American economic life, perceptions of medical licensure also evolved in directions more compatible with the country's Jeffersonian ethos. Licensure was now framed as a bulwark against the corrupting influence of faceless corporations, leading to the reintroduction of licensure regulations requiring an academic degree in addition to board examination. By the turn of the twentieth century, these regulations had spread to every state.", "The rise of corporations in America also enabled the accumulation of unprecedented wealth among business elites. As they reflected on how to contribute their funds toward larger societal objectives, many became aware of the backwardness of American medicine compared to Europe's application of laboratory science. Ambitious aspiring doctors traveled to places such as Germany to study medicine, returning as zealous advocates for importing this model to the United States. When Baltimore businessman Johns Hopkins died in 1873, he bequeathed his fortune to the establishment of an institution in this mold. This model would be rolled out nationwide following the release of the Flexner Report in 1910. The report, which decried the quality of North American medical instruction, precipitated the shutdown or reorganization of a vast number of teaching institutions, with major foundations devoting roughly half of their giving to medical education.", "Among physicians, a professional culture emerged that sought to insulate American medicine from the pressures of both the democratic state and the market economy. This is illustrated by statements from the American Medical Association decrying the influence of the \"spirit of trade\" on the profession, as well as by William H. Welch's statement to a Senate Committee in 1900 that \"all medicine asked of Congress was not to interfere with its progress.\"", "American health care remained more personalistic and less hospital-based. Physicians had access to support staff and equipment furnished by hospitals without being their employees, and even modest forms of corporate organization were opposed as threats to professional autonomy. The Jeffersonian skepticism of concentrated power had been reconciled with clinical expertise, resulting in an American health care system led by highly-trained physicians.", "As America progressed toward the frontier of scientific medicine, the conflict between Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian ideals came to a head with the challenge of providing health care services to the mass public. While charitable financiers played a significant role in America's medical professionalization, their interest and funds were insufficient to bankroll health care for the public as a whole. To provide high-quality medicine for the bulk of its citizens while still respecting their Jeffersonian skepticism of government power, the United States would gradually establish an opaque patchwork of programs and subsidies aimed at financing health care broadly while maintaining the appearance of personal responsibility.", "With physicians increasingly professionalized, the gradual shift in hospitals' operational model from charity to cost-reimbursement created growing problems for patients attempting to access the system. Whereas European government had gotten involved in financing health insurance as early as the 1870s, small government attitudes thwarted similar social insurance schemes from being established in the United States. Indeed, even voluntary insurance was widely opposed among American physicians up until the Great Depression, viewing such arrangements as threats to their autonomy.", "The dam on federal involvement in financing health care broke in earnest with the establishment of a tax subsidy for employer-provided health insurance during World War II. After the war, the Hill-Burton Act of 1946 provided federal matching funds that led to a substantial expansion of hospital construction in communities across the country. This development shifted the power centers in the American health care industry, with hospitals and health insurers gaining influence that rivaled that of physicians. The American health care industry became characterized by a tripartite separation of powers between physicians, hospitals, and health insurance companies.", "With federal subsidies having decisively reoriented health care financing around employers by the 1960s, the gaps in health care coverage for those outside that system, namely the elderly and the poor, had become increasingly apparent. In spite of opposition from the industry's players, the federal government enacted bills authorizing the creation of Medicare and Medicaid aimed at providing public health insurance to these populations. Reflecting the considerable skepticism these programs faced from industry players at the time, as well as the broader American mistrust of government meddling in health care, these programs were set up to mimic the relations within the private market. Government provision of health insurance in America did not entail that the system be placed on a budget, as had been the case in other countries.", "The tension between Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian ideals in American health care reached a tipping point in the 1970s amid rapidly rising prices. The government's growing commitment to paying for health care clashed with its longstanding hands-off approach to delivery. Overutilization and waste were believed to be the problems, but getting the government directly involved in care decisions was a political nonstarter. In response to this dilemma, the government pursued policies aimed at reducing health care costs through indirect means. One example here is \"certificate of need\", which aimed to control utilization by restricting the availability of health care services. The other prominent strategy was encouraging the growth of managed care, empowering private third-parties to control utilization rather than the government. The resulting health care system is perhaps best labeled as \"decentralized Hamiltonianism,\" reflecting a mix of Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian elements.", "By the 1980s, the health care industry became alarmed by the tightening control measures. Reforms to Medicare reimbursement as well as the looming specter of managed care led many in the industry to believe that the good times were effectively over. One influential report released in 1981 projected a \"physician surplus\" unless the profession's size was constrained. Federal support for physician education and training was withdrawn, and M.D.-granting medical schools put a voluntary moratorium on new schools and enrollment. Hospitals followed suit and began consolidating rapidly to accommodate themselves to a managed care world. At the time, few were concerned about the impact on competitionas these changes were viewed as consistent with the conventional wisdom that American medicine would increasingly resemble the Taylorist industrial factory floor, with a lean, highly specialized workforce coordinated through large, vertically integrated health systems.", "The administrative complexity of American health care was exacerbated by this turn toward managerialism. Owing to Americans' skepticism of concentrated power, authority had always been more dispersed, spread across various stakeholders including health insurers, hospitals, employers, the courts, levels of government, and non-profit bodies. This gradual supplanting of clinical expertise with managerial authority was helped along by events such as the highly publicized Libby Zion case, which shook the public's confidence in the safety and quality of American medicine. These trends not only empowered administrators within health system facilities and government, but also the various non-profits regulatory bodies that derive power either directly as government-designated accreditors or indirectly through malpractice law.", "By the early 2000s, the long-heralded managed care revolution had largely collapsed. The drive toward consolidation and specialization taken to accommodate managed care created conditions for its overthrow. Many of the cost-control measures seemed draconian. The lack of insurance choice provided in our employer-based system allowed this dissatisfaction to bottle up until it eventually reached a breaking point. Industry groups, realizing the public was on their side, supported laws that substantially constrained managed care. Against the backdrop of a strong economy, health care providers realized that all they had to do was say \"no,\" and the system fell apart. After a decade-long pause, American health care costs resumed their pre-managed care trend of rapid ascent.", "The system we are left with today might alternately be described as \"monopolistic Jeffersonianism\" or \"incoherent Hamiltonianism\". No matter what you choose to call it, the fact remains that it is a mess. Despite the retreat of managed care, the trend of hospital consolidation and physician specialization continued, driven by financial incentives to gain market power. No reexamination of the decisions made during the managed care era took place, highlighting the continuing conflict between the Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian approaches in the American health care system. Nowhere is this lack of clarity better illustrated than the Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010, which combined health insurance expansions with a grab bag of managerialist tweaks drawn from various incompatible points of view regarding the overarching direction toward which the American health care system should evolve.", "The paradox of the American health care system is that its Jeffersonian heritage, with its mistrust of unchecked power, has led to a system that is so complex that accountability is impossible. The once simple fee-for-service model has given way to a fragmented mess, based on a patchwork of insurers and countless uncoordinated oversight bodies. The resulting health care system is needlessly cumbersome, wasting hospitals' budgets on administrative overheads and forcing doctors to spend countless hours on paperwork instead of patient care. Patients, too, face myriad difficulties navigating the labyrinthine system. To restore order, a more Hamiltonian approach is needed to streamline administration, reduce complexity, and increase efficiency.", "Limiting the supply of health care facilities and professionals is not the answer to the problem of waste. Such restraints don't lead to the most valuable care being prioritized and cause sensible utilization restraints to be experienced as draconian by patients. Instead, we need a more Jeffersonian commitment to ensuring that health care markets are competitive, with a focus on balancing supply and demand to provide high-quality medicine and personal relationships with providers.", "To realize the potential of the American health care system, we must strike a better balance between Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian impulses, taking the best from each aspect of our heritage. The resulting health care system could be described along lines such as \"state-capacity Jeffersonianism\" or \"competitive Hamiltonianism\". But no matter how we choose to categorize it, the fact remains that the United States needs to more thoroughly embrace Jeffersonianism in terms of delivering health care and more Hamiltonianism regarding how we organize it.", "This article is part of the American System series edited by David A.
