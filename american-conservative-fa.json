Winston Churchill in 1946 dreamed of a \"United States of Europe\", in which the member nations, above all France and Germany, were \"freely joined for mutual convenience in a federal system.\" The United Kingdom, of course, would remain separate from these new United States. Basic steps toward accomplishing such a union were soon undertaken, when in 1951 the Treaty of Paris-signed by Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany-established the European Coal and Steel Community, the seed from which later arose the European Union.", "But these first steps toward economic and political cooperation were undertaken under the approaching storm clouds of the Cold War.

After rising to the presidency in the newly formed Fifth Republic, Charles de Gaulle hoped to bring about a \"Europe of Fatherlands,\" which would preserve the sovereignty of its member nations rather than dissolving them into a larger supranational entity. This Europe, de Gaulle famously announced in 1959, would stretch \"from the Atlantic to the Urals.\" It would, in other words, include distant Russia as a partner, not an adversary. With that, the decidedly anti-American French president hoped to exclude the United States from the continent and ideally the United Kingdom, too, which he-not without justification-at that point regarded as little more than an American outpost.", "Ironically, out of the same nationalist aspirations, France had sunk the more plausible attempts to form a joint European military, such as the European Defence Community, whose ratification France prevented by never even bringing it to a vote in its parliament. Then in 1966, De Gaulle visited the Soviet Union for the first time since 1944. Also in 1966 he withdrew France from the NATO Military Command Structure. This angered the Atlanticists within the Western German government greatly.", "\"And the more blatantly the general cooperated with Moscow,\" Gregor Sch\u00f6llgen has written elsewhere, \"the closer the Federal Republic of Germany moved to the side of the predominant power USA.\" After all, the Germans needed America's nuclear and conventional forces to protect them from a possible Soviet invasion.", "But the Germans, too, in their own right sought rapprochement with the Soviets. And natural gas would play a key role in those efforts. Since the 1950s, German companies sought to close deals with Russia to sell them steel pipes. A first one fell victim to an embargo imposed in 1962 as a consequence of the construction of the Berlin Wall. But in 1970, amid Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik, a first of a series of so-called \"gas pipe deals\" went through. The Nord Stream agreement of 2005 was, in fact, the fifth such deal, all of which were made under social democratic chancellors.

This the Biden administration, intent on knocking Russia off the map as a formidable regional power, apparently could not permit.", "The U.S. defense establishment could also not permit further energy ties with Russia because it did not trust Germany's will to remain a devoted Western partner.

The treaty was later seen by many skeptical Western observers as the first step toward the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Such would be the likely outcome, it seemed, if Germany was ever allowed to maneuver freely again.", "This fear was laughable. Germany by the 1970s was a dramatically different country than just two generations earlier, with far more restrained national ambitions. As part of the Ostpolitik, for example, the Federal Republic officially gave up all long-term goals of regaining its lost territories east of the Oder-Neisse line. This was no easy sell; even as late as 1959, 70 percent of West Germans rejected reunification if it was accompanied by the permanent loss of these territories. In 1990, a newly reunified Germany officially recognized its post-war border to Poland. For the younger generations of today, the former imperial ambitions and ultra-nationalist sentiments of Wilhelmine and Nazi Germany are the stuff of high school history classes.", "Ostpolitik", "Successive German administrations have nonetheless sought to gain more freedom to act independently of American will. This culminated in Schr\u00f6der's vocal and admirable opposition to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. At the time Schr\u00f6der famously said that it was his ambition to deal with the Americans \"on an equal footing.\" The United States repaid this perceived betrayal by what Donald Rumsfeld called the \"old Europe\" by blocking Germany's ambition of becoming a permanent member of the U.N.

We will bring an end to it.\"", "Since Hersh published his investigations into the destruction of the pipelines, the Scholz administration has still kept mum. When the Left Party politician Sahra Wagenknecht made a formal parliamentary inquiry and asked the government to reveal everything it knew about who the culprits were, the government refused and said that \"in the interest of the welfare of the state\" the findings needed to be kept secret.

But there is a rational calculus at the heart of Scholz's dreams: The 500 million number would represent a massive power potential that would outstrip the population size of the United States and be roughly a third of China's massive population. And it is these two countries that will divide the spoils of the future between themselves and struggle to set global industrial standards.", "Europe, by contrast, is far from achieving what is ultimately necessary to become a great power in its own right: political integration, which would include a military of its own. Right now, the not-yet-entirely-sovereign Germany doesn't even know where on its own territory the Americans keep their nuclear weapons.

These include:", "the implementation of a majority vote that orients itself along that of the failed constitution of October 2004; the possibility to effectively sanction or even expel member nations that do not abide by the joint legal standards...the evolution of the monetary into a fiscal union; the definition of a unified European legal system; the development of a feasible migration and asylum policy; the formulation of a binding and sustainable resource, energy and environmental strategy; and not least a supranational army.", "In order to realize these goals, Schr\u00f6der and Sch\u00f6llgen conclude, the member nations would have to \"relinquish a considerable amount of their national sovereignty, no ifs, ands, or buts.\" And that is the part that especially Eastern European member nations like Poland or Hungary would never accept, since the threat of expulsion for not abiding by the E.U.'s progressive cultural politics is obvious to these culturally conservative countries. That is not to mention the fundamentally antidemocratic nature of such a transformed political union, which would concentrate political decision-making authority to an unprecedented level with distant bureaucrats in Brussels. And they have enough power as it is.", "Schr\u00f6der and Sch\u00f6llgen know full well what it means when they harken back to the \"failed constitution,\" which was resoundingly defeated by democratic referenda in several European nations, not least France. The opposite, then, is more likely, namely a Europe of regained national sovereignty, perhaps with a future neo-Gaullist French president leading the charge.", "Until then, the hinge that held Europe together is a pile of shrapnel at the bottom of the Baltic. \"Gas,\" Schr\u00f6der and Sch\u00f6llgen wrote, \"will be for the foreseeable future a power source without alternative. The demand increases to the same amount that coal and nuclear plants are decommissioned.\"", "This invocation of an energy policy without alternatives is, of course, absurd. It will forever be a stain on Schr\u00f6der's record that he empowered the Green Party. The Greens have fundamentally transformed themselves from the hippie-esque pacifist party of their early days into a ruthless proponent of NATO. But one thing has remained steady-an obsessive opposition to nuclear power, whose phasing out was initiated by Schr\u00f6der's government and seems now definite after the Greens returned to power under Scholz.", "And so Scholz may still dream of setting global standards and leading a united Europe, but in greater likelihood Europeans will need to turn down their thermostats and cope with blackouts in the future, while the German foreign secretary, the Green Party official Annalena Baerbock, shoots her mouth off by saying that \"we are fighting a war against Russia.\" That is not a Europe, and certainly not a Germany, that maneuvers \"freely between East and West\"-but one that once again stumbles blindly toward the abyss."], "headline": "Europe, Interrupted", "timestamp": "", "act": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/europe-interrupted/"}, "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/russian-realism/": {"paras": ["Russia's destructive attack on Ukraine was unjustified and has earned Moscow opprobrium the world over.

However, they had long chafed at Georgian rule and Putin attacked Georgia only after the Saakashvili government suicidally shelled Russian forces. In 2014, he grabbed Crimea, which was long ruled by Moscow before its 1954 transfer by Nikita Khrushchev, likely as part of the succession struggle after Joseph Stalin's death. Russia also promoted separatism in parts of the Donbas, which some Ukrainians later suggested was largely worthless territory best left with Moscow. These are the bases of a revived Russian Empire?", "Moreover, Russian aggressions were triggered by events. Again, Western leaders conveniently ignore history in seeking to avoid responsibility for their own foolish, often reckless, behavior. In 2008, the Bush administration insisted on NATO's promise to induct Tbilisi and Kiev, which caused Fiona Hill, lately of the National Security Council, to warn that such moves \"would likely provoke pre-emptive Russian military action.\" Washington also declared Georgia to be an ally as the Saakashvili government pushed hard for NATO membership.", "Six years later, the U.S. backed crippling street protests against Ukraine's duly elected, if corrupt, pro-Russian leader.

In her role as Germany's foreign minister, she has staked out a more pro-war position than her country's chancellor, Olaf Scholz.", "Perhaps this should be unsurprising. The Green Party's hostility to fossil fuels means that it can regard one of the downsides of the war-rising energy prices-as a benefit.

In a speech delivered on February 18, he said, \"The war in Ukraine is not a war between the armies of good and evil, but a war between the troops of two Slavic countries: a war limited in time and-for the time being-in space.\" This view stands in contrast to dominant narratives in both Russia and the West. Putin has presented his invasion as a holy struggle against a godless foe. Leaders in Europe and the United States have presented their cause as a crusade for democracy. Each side has revived memories of World War II, insisting that they are fighting against resurgent fascism. In Orban's view, the stakes are somewhat lower.", "If Europe does come around to the Hungarian position, Szijjarto expects no credit. \"It is possible that in the future the European policies will be closer to what we represent now. But you know, politics is not a profession based on credits. Regardless of the fact that now everybody does what we have been doing since 2015 on migration, no one admits that.

The dominos that would fall in the case of a total grid collapse start with phone lines, internet, and traffic lights, and end with looting, crime, and civil unrest.", "So electricity could be the pillar that finally brings the Rainbow Nation tumbling to the ground. Why Eskom? Because it sits at the intersection of the three themes of South Africa's long decline: politics, incompetence, and crime.", "Politics is what prevented Eskom from raising rates throughout the late 1990s and mid-2000s, when it badly needed revenue in order to build new power stations and replace old ones. Cheap electricity was seen as a perk of post-apartheid freedom, and hikes were avoided at all costs out of fear of public backlash. The result was that Eskom's generation capacity deteriorated to the point of crisis, and efforts to repair the damage were too little, too late.", "Many South Africans simply refuse to pay their electricity bills, which is also a political problem. There is no way the ruling party would permit Eskom to cut off the vast majority of Soweto residents (around 80 percent) who don't pay. Eskom therefore finds it impossible to collect the tens of billions of rand it is owed by delinquent customers. Even when it does attempt to cut off deadbeats, vandalism and illegal hookups render such measures futile. Any serious crackdown by Eskom on this rampant theft would doubtless be met with violence.", "This would be a challenge even for the best managers, but Eskom's managers are not the best. As a parastatal, Eskom is subject to aggressive diversity targets under Black Economic Empowerment laws. In 1995, its senior management was mandated to go from 70 percent white to 50 percent black by 1999 and 75 percent black by 2005. In 2008, Eskom's head of human resources announced, \"Over the next five years...Eskom has to appoint two new staff every day, and it is adamant that one of them will be a black woman.\"", "These targets were replicated across all sectors of the South African economy, and everywhere they have had the same effect: incompetence. Anthea Jeffery's Bee: Helping or Hurting? documents multiple instances where people died because hospital administrators or water inspectors hired due to affirmative action were not qualified for their jobs. R.W. Johnson, the international press's most widely read writer on South African affairs, has only one leg today because in 2009 he injured his foot swimming in a lagoon that proved to be polluted and the resulting infection required an amputation-just one more casualty of incompetence at the Department of Water Affairs.", "Bee: Helping or Hurting?", " ", "The electricity business involves bigger sums of money than water management, which is where the third factor in Eskom's fall comes in: crime. Eskom has been a target of mafia syndicates in a way that other utilities have not, because of the black market value of the commodities it handles, notably coal but also wires and equipment. South African journalist Kyle Cowan investigated several failures at Eskom facilities, such as downed pylons and jammed coal mills, and discovered many cases where sabotage was the likely cause. Never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence-but, as the assassination attempt against De Ruyter shows, both are certainly at play here. Plant managers at Eskom facilities need bulletproof vests and armed bodyguards to walk around their own facilities.", "The fundamental problem that makes Eskom's situation so intractable, as De Ruyter said in his interview, is that \"you can't post a policeman over every employee's shoulder to watch what he's doing.\" Sabotage and theft are often invisible. The effort needed to turn around such a widespread problem would be massive, requiring support not only from management at all levels but from law enforcement, politicians, and bureaucrats. That is why it is unlikely to happen. De Ruyter eventually concluded as much, which is why he is heading off for a well-deserved vacation-somewhere out of the country, he says, beyond the reach of assassins. \"I think it will be good for my health.\""], "headline": "Why South Africa's Collapse Finally Came Down to Eskom", "timestamp": "", "act": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/why-south-africas-collapse-finally-came-down-to-eskom/"}, "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-e-u-s-new-power-couple/": {"paras": ["Since World War II, the United States has had a bipartisan policy toward Europe.

The reality is that the E.U. mouths support for the U.S. for American defense guarantees while, at the same time, cozying up with America's rivals, whether Russian or Chinese.", "Rather than recognize how outrageous this situation is, successive American presidents have, mostly, refused to demand more from those who demand so much of us. When Europeans have discussed going their own way on defense, they have faced criticism-including from none other than Donald Trump, who suggested that European countries should pay their share of the NATO defense budget before pursuing their own projects.", "have", "Both the Trump and Biden Administrations have been maddeningly unclear on America's policy toward China, waffling on whether or not China is a serious enemy or just a friend to \"out-compete.\" Why would the E.U. risk economic storms to break up with a country that America couldn't even say was an enemy-while knowing that there was no way America would ever abandon them?", "America's policy for Europe may have worked in the midst of the Cold War, but it is delusional to think that it would work in the 21st century, when the primary threat is on the other side of Eurasia-and both parties have continued on with the delusion. Fortunately, with elements of foreign policy realism being embraced by both GOP frontrunners, there now exists a chance for conservatives to find a new way forward.", "During the Cold War, American policy was straightforward regarding Europe: keep it free of governmental anti-Americanism. The practical upshot of this goal was keeping the Russians out and the Germans down. The Europeans were happy to add \"...and the Americans in\" to that formulation, and voila: the rationale for NATO came into existence.", "Now there is no ideology that can convert Europe into an anti-American satellite-and there are easier (and cheaper) ways to keep Europe free of anti-Americanism than what we're doing now. America can do this by taking advantage of the European fault-lines, centuries old, which have re-opened after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.", "Over the course of the invasion, an old quasi-alliance has quietly returned: that of France and Poland. This friendship has appeared off and on throughout history; Napoleon resurrected a Polish state, and during the 1930s and World War II the two nations were closely aligned. It is driven, as are all international relations, by power politics. France has long aspired to have political control over Europe and gain supremacy over Germany; Poland aspires to keep existing despite the historic threats of Germany and Russia. The latest iteration, though less obvious than in the past (due partially to Poland's semi-pariah status in the E.U. as a result of its conservatism), has seen France and Poland unofficially team up to embarrass Germany into sending tanks to Ukraine.", "Post-war America has traditionally supported Germany over France. Former Chancellor Angela Merkel-whose terrible foreign policy incumbent Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been unlucky enough to inherit, though he has not made his own job any easier with his inconsistent stance-was close with both George W. Bush and Barack Obama. From the perspective of keeping the E.U. as a vassal, this made sense on paper: Despite its enormous economic power, post-war Germany clearly telegraphed that it had no desire to march across Europe once again and was generally well-liked by the rest of the continent. By supporting the power that had no desire to turn the E.U. into something more, America kept Europe down and docile.", "Things have changed. Germany's position in post-war Europe has never been weaker. Scholz's polling numbers among the German public are poor, and, with regard to the wider E.U., Germany's waffling on the Russo-Ukrainian War has pleased no one and aggravated everyone. This is France and Poland's moment to strike while the iron is hot.", "It is also the prime moment for America to change horses. Germany is not doing whatever America wants, nor are they really staying down. Just years ago, they declared it \"unacceptable\" for America to consider moving its own troops-troops that were defending them from Russia, a country they were happy to do deals with over American protests. They also recently announced stronger economic ties with China and affirmed no decoupling would take place. (When France balks at decoupling from China, it at least lacks hypocrisy-the nation has been ambivalent or hostile to American defense since de Gaulle.) In short, Germany is unpopular, weak, and uncooperative.", "What would revamping America's policy toward Europe look like? One possibility is fostering the France-Poland alignment within a stronger E.U. framework. America's instinctual hatred of any form of an independent E.U. military force should be jettisoned; we should instead embrace the concept. A pan-European army might be a long way off, but with France and Poland pushing the E.U. to take care of itself-and Poland clearly desiring a strong military of its own-we should allow them to plant the seeds. This does our work for us at a fraction of the cost and commitment. A more militarized Franco-Polish-led E.U. means a more centralized E.U. The more centralized the E.U., the less China's influence over single states will matter.", "If America were to support this shift, it would bolster its popularity across eastern Europe; former Soviet-orbit states would jump at the chance to join a serious continental army, which would allow them to defend themselves independent of great-power neighbors. The E.U. has about 400 million people, nuclear weapons, and a GDP close to that of the U.S.; there is no reason why a militarized E.U. could not handle Russia without the U.S. American support for a robust, independent E.U. bloc means such an alliance would never be definitively pro-China, keeping anti-Americanism out of that end of Eurasia and allowing the U.S. to move its strategic focus to the Pacific.", "This would be a dramatic reconception of American foreign policy. The lack of \"war for democracy\"-style arguments may bother the remaining neoconservatives, and a lack of total withdrawal from NATO may bother some paleoconservatives.
