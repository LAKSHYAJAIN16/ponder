", "Despite being forced from office in disgrace and presiding over a massive decline in support for both himself and his party, Johnson is still attempting to influence government policy. His supporters say his interventions are the Conservatives' last hopes at saving the party from decimation at the next election. His\u00a0critics think he is not only undermining current PM Rishi Sunak, but, by reminding voters - with\u00a0many of\u00a0whom he is unpopular - of his existence, he is damaging\u00a0his\u00a0party's\u00a0electoral prospects.  ", "A quick recap: Johnson was forced to resign after multiple ethics scandals made his position untenable.\u00a0Those\u00a0scandals\u00a0included the notorious \"Partygate\" where Johnson became the first sitting PM to be found guilty of breaking the law\u00a0by holding illegal gatherings during the pandemic lockdown. The final straw came for Johnson after\u00a0it\u00a0allegations emerged that his deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, had been sexually harassing party members while drunk. Johnson hired Pincher despite\u00a0being aware of\u00a0rumors about his conduct.  ", "Johnson has spent much of the past week leaving Westminster guessing as to whether or not he is going to publicly come out against Sunak as he attempts to negotiate an agreement with the European Union to fix part of the 2019 Brexit deal. It is worth noting that Johnson himself negotiated and signed that deal, calling it \"oven ready\" during his\u00a0election campaign\u00a0that same year.  ", "The part of the deal causing all the problems is the Northern Ireland Protocol, an arrangement that theoretically prevents a hard border between Northern Ireland, which left the EU along with the rest of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state. Both sides agree a border should not exist for fears of provoking tensions and violence.\u00a0Northern Ireland has been largely peaceful since a 1998 accord ended the three-decades-long \"Troubles,\" in which more than 3,500 people were killed.  ", "The UK has not implemented the protocol in full for fears it would damage trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Northern Irish\u00a0pro-British\u00a0unionists claim the protocol cuts the province off from the rest of the UK, while hardline English Brexiteers believe the protocol - and any deal Sunak might make to revive it - is essentially a capitulation to the EU, despite\u00a0them\u00a0supporting the deal in 2019.  ", "Those hardliners, along with Johnson, believe that Sunak should specifically not abandon a piece of proposed legislation that Johnson introduced during his time in office, the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which allows the UK government to rip up parts of the protocol. Critics say this would break international law. The constant noise and anticipation of a Johnson intervention has effectively killed talks of an agreement being reached with the EU and left many questioning Sunak's strength to deliver as PM.  ", "Johnson has also publicly implored Sunak to become the first\u00a0Western\u00a0leader\u00a0to\u00a0send fighter jets to Ukraine as the conflict marks its 12-month anniversary.  ", "The vast majority of MPs that CNN spoke with are sick of Johnson's \"attention seeking,\" as many of them described it. They all declined to speak on the record for fear of derailing Northern Ireland talks which, as many of them were quick to say, is a very dangerous situation, pointing to the shooting of a detective that took place in the province just this week.  ", "\"I just wish he would get on side and realize that his efforts would be best spent supporting Rishi,\" said a former government minister who served under Johnson. \"The next election is going to be hard enough without this distraction. Boris is still popular in certain parts of the country that we might lose seats. He should be up there campaigning, not teasing a return to the frontline.\"  ", "Another government minister who also served under Johnson is less optimistic about Johnson's ability to help, even if he wanted to.  ", "\"He is fundamentally too selfish to want to help the people who he no doubt believes kicked him out of office unfairly,\" the former minister said. \"And he is unpopular enough that the prospect of him returning to the frontline could be one of the biggest motivating factors for people to vote against us.\"  ", "The polls back up this theory. A recent Ipsos MORI survey revealed that Johnson is still less trusted than either Sunak or leader of the opposition Keir Starmer. Poll after poll on the outcome at the next general election predicts the Conservatives suffering heavy losses. The dip in the Conservative's fortunes can be traced directly back to the start of the Partygate scandal. Before that, Johnson was enjoying an unusually high level of support, thanks in large part to the UK's successful Covid vaccine roll-out.  ", "Johnson's supporters don't entirely believe the polls and challenge the narrative that he is responsible for the collapse in the Conservatives' support, claiming instead it was due to a media obsession with Partygate.  ", "One Johnson loyalist told CNN that \"people forget he won us the largest majority since Margaret Thatcher\" and believes he is still \"a giant\" in the eyes of the public. His supporters in the party welcome his interventions, with one saying of the Northern Ireland debate, still taking aim at the press,\u00a0that the media \"should welcome the widest possible debate on this major constitutional issue for our nation.\"  ", "Other Conservatives fear that the Johnson loyalists, who are mostly at the harder end of the Brexit-supporting spectrum, will learn the hard way that their assumptions are wrong.  ", "\"Most of his supporters in parliament have either already decided to stand down at the next election, probably because they know the writing is on the wall, or stand a very good chance of losing their seat,\" the former government\u00a0minister\u00a0said.  ", "A senior Conservative and former cabinet minister who worked in government with Johnson\u00a0looks on with some degree of bewilderment. \"I don't really know what these hardline Brexiters are hoping to achieve. The public largely views Brexit as a mistake, so why double down on it so aggressively,\" they\u00a0\u00a0mused.  ", "There are an increasing number of Conservatives who look at the polls and think a heavy loss at the next general election is inevitable. They see one\u00a0big\u00a0advantage of Johnson returning to the frontline:\u00a0that him\u00a0lose\u00a0losing\u00a0might finally kill the myth that he is the\u00a0\"chosen one\"\u00a0and finally draw a line under the\u00a0whole\u00a0Johnson experiment.  ", "It seems unlikely that Johnson\u00a0will end his agitation from\u00a0the backbenches, especially over policies that he believes might trash his legacy. However, the louder he shouts and\u00a0the\u00a0harder he stamps his feet, the biggest threat to the Johnson legacy could easily become Boris Johnson himself. Whether he brings down his party too seems a matter that doesn't\u00a0unduly\u00a0bother many of his supporters.

", "Sturgeon said she could no longer give her full energy to the job, and that she felt she must say so now. \"I have been wrestling with it, albeit with oscillating levels of intensity for some weeks,\" the 52-year-old leader said. \"Giving absolutely everything of yourself to this job is the only way to do it.\"   ", "She said it was difficult to have a private life, noting it was hard to \"meet friends for a coffee or go for a walk on your own\" and observed that there was a \"brutality\" to life at the top.

", "While Sturgeon underlined that she felt she didn't have enough left in the tank to perform her duties, her list of political headaches has grown. The SNP's polling has dipped, making a dent in its grip on Scottish politics. The independence movement has stalled, with no real chance of a referendum on the cards any time soon.   ", "She has lost support in her party since she attempted to introduce the controversial bill on gender identification, with some polls suggesting a majority of Scots supported the decision of the UK government to use its powers to block the proposal. And her husband was caught in a scandal at the end of last year, after it was reported he had personally loaned the SNP \u00a3100,000.  ", "In short, having dominated Scottish politics for eight years, wielding the independence baseball bat and regularly using it to batter the UK government, Sturgeon might have decided to quit before her legacy is tarnished by failure.  ", "When Scotland held a referendum in 2014, voters rejected the prospect of independence by 55% to 45% - but the political landscape then changed, mostly because of Brexit.  ", "A majority of people in Scotland voted to remain in the European Union in the 2016 Brexit referendum, and the SNP successfully used Brexit as a wedge issue, arguing that Scots were dragged out of the EU against their will.   ", "This boosted support for independence for a time, but that push has run into a brick wall more recently. In November, Britain's Supreme Court ruled that the Scottish government cannot unilaterally hold a second independence referendum.  ", "This means that the SNP is faced with the problem that the UK government must approve any decision to hold a referendum.   ", "Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, four consecutive Conservative prime ministers, didn't entertain the idea. It also seems very unlikely that Keir Starmer, the leader of the official opposition Labour Party, would give any boost to the idea, given that Labour needs to win seats in Scotland in order to win a UK parliamentary majority.  ", "The SNP is due to have a special conference on independence next month. It is now likely it will go into that conference divided and without any certainty of its direction. All of which will make those opposed to independence very happy indeed.
